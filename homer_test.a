mr. bergstrom left today.
he's gone. forever.
i didn't think you'd understand.
i'm glad i'm not crying because i would hate for you to think that what i'm about to say is based on emotion. but you, sir, are a baboon!
yes, you! baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!
whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. i just can't believe it was her.
homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. there's a little girl upstairs who needs you. her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her daddy.
no!
look, if you just want me to forgive you --
that was our wedding.
yeah.
you're so silly.
i don't have any banana.
i'm sorry i called you a baboon, dad.
ah, dad, if just me, milhouse and lewis had voted...
no.
yeah.
well, no.
hey! thanks, monkey-man.
homie, did you straighten everything out...?
homer! you promised!
yeah, you can't have any fun in bed.
oh! they're here! how does everything look?
do we have enough glasses?
homer! homer! put a record on!
hey, homer! care to try some of my flanders planters punch?
au contraire, simpson! it has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor.
now, homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. remember last year at the winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?
hi! you're homer's sister-in-law, right? i remember you, but i don't remember you being so beau --tiful. ow! hey! jeez! is that a new kind of mace? it's really painful.
uh, no, not really. someone seems to have slipped one of those novelty ice cubes with a fake fly in my drink.
what?
yes sir.
what?
what?
oh, homer, you're the king!
homer, i don't know you. my wife and your wife are friends. we met just three hours ago.
uh, gee homer, don't quit...
oh sure.
i have never been so embarrassed in my life.
come here!
homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?
good lord! there's a fly in my drink!
you did?
homer, i like to think that i'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. but last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
i'm going to church alone today. you're going to stay here and explain to bart why you scarred him for life.
i understand why. you were wasted.
dad, i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will.
now before i give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, i have some announcements to make. we have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including "bible bafflers", "satan's boners," "good grief! more satan's boners" and, for the teens, "it's not cool to fry in hell."
i'm sorry. the lord and i can't compete with the squeaking of homer simpson's shoes. why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
... or those just in need of a tune-up.
will the simpsons be attending our little retreat?
now you wanna go?
oh my. where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
don't take that tone with me, young lady, or i'll give you a taste of the back of me hand.
oh sure. last resort... old grampa, the feeb. the guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. everyone's agin me. i'll do it.
where ya headed?
oh, after general sherman, are ya?
he's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
they do.
now, that there's the only known picture of the general. can't see what he is, exactly. he's freakishly big, though.
why, homer simpson! here to give your marriage a little spit shine?
oh, i'm afraid not. a marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, homer. it takes a whole weekend to do that.
we must bait our hooks with honesty. that way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.
sometimes maude, god bless her, she underlines passages in my bible because she can't find hers.
homer, why are you here?
no, no, homer. marge is going to tell us all your faults. why don't you tell us about hers?
come on, homer. what are her faults?
now, marge. don't interrupt. you'll get your turn.
he forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes...
homer, don't interrupt.
he blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle...
homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? i can't believe your selfishness. you can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. you're thinking about fishing, even when i'm talking... right now. right?
yes.
we came to this retreat because i thought our marriage was in trouble, but i never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. homer, how can you expect me to believe....
to who?
all this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
oh yeah, sure.
how's your marriage?
ohhh.
homer!
all right, homer. whoa, you really are a sport, dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger!
i need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
oh please, dad. i want this more than anything in the world.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
okay.
get a job! were they serious? i didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever.
he didn't say it, and neither did i, but at that moment my dad and i were closer than we ever...
so long, officers. uh-oh.
moon pies, my butt... somebody oughta moon pie her...
i've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all i got was fifty cents.
really?
dad, i've done everything i could and i've only got thirty-five bucks. ugh.. i am through with working. working is for chumps.
homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?
ah, chief wiggum, archbishop mcgee, distinguished guests. i am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. in the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of springfield, what to do.
i don't wanna.
you know, homer, i am your supervisor.
it's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. hump and dew-lap. hump and dew-lap.
a-positive.
sixteen permanent, eight baby.
glow in the dark monster make-up. oh, homie, you have lots of hair... why did you want to know your blood type?
bart does.
hey, wait a minute. i don't have to give blood. i have rights, you know.
is it a bible story?
how did a lion get rich?
oh yeah! during the day, all my friends are in school, so i got a job as a certified bloodletting tech dude.
homer, brave young bart. i don't know which one to hug first.
oh, hey, there, mr... brown shoes! how about that local sports team? hm?
yes, dad.
the meaning of what?
homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
yeah, mom. we got hosed!
we got exactly what we wanted out of this: we gave an old man a second chance.
you stink.
an elephant's butt?
but he's your boss. do you have to mail it right this minute?
you're still angry, homer. why don't you sleep on it?
please, homie? for me?
homer... breakfast is ready.
oh... thank you.
homer, i don't think it's in the cornstarch canister.
yup.
the last place i saw it...
...was in my hand...
...as i was shoving it into the mailbox.
dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. and i know you. you're an emotional guy. just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. so i...
homer, you encouraged him. you should be strangling yourself.
give it up, homer. it's locked up tight.
why the hose, homer?
yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?
dad, the mailman is here.
dear god! are you planning to water the mail?
that's right.
okay, mr. burns. what's your first name?
ooh, look, maggie, what is that? do-dec-ah-edron. dodecahedron.
oh, don't be frightened of this. it's nothing but a letter opener. who are you?
simpson, eh? simpson. oh, why, there's a letter here from you. i'll just read it right now. "dear mr. burns. i'm so glad you enjoyed my son's blood. and your card was just great." why, simpson. you've made my day. you're a true gentleman.
hello, there's more. "in case you can't tell, i'm being sarcastic..." "...you stink, you are a senile, buck-toothed..." "...old mummy... with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!"
honey, what's done is done. no matter what happens, we'll pull through. we always do.
hold on, i'll check. mike rotch. mike rotch. hey, has anybody seen mike rotch, lately? listen you little puke. one of these days i'm gonna catch you, and i'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick. what's the matter homer? you're not your normal effervescent self.
wait, dad, he's smiling.
it's to open the crate, stupid.
no, maggie. not az-tec. ol-mec. ol-mec.
it doesn't do anything.
sir, you're my god of generosity.
well then, i guess the moral is, "no good deed goes unrewarded."
perhaps there is no moral to this story.
but it certainly was a memorable few days!
i tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
i washed it.
now homer, don't panic. you have plenty of white shirts.
ah, my lucky red hat. clean as a whistle!
it has pink frosting!
let's go, pinky.
well, monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. that's all changed, thanks to the "marvin monroe take home personality test." twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is.
homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. i can't fill this out for you.
well, all right -- if you listen to the poem i just wrote.
meditations on turning eight, by lisa simpson. i had a cat named snowball -- she died, she died! mom said she was sleeping -- she lied, she lied! why oh why is my cat dead? couldn't that chrysler hit me, instead? i had a hamster named snuffy -- he died, --
dad, maybe you should do this.
dog on fire. ruff! anybody order a hot dog?
and finally, "baby with a nail gun."
okay, it's time to cast your votes now.
hey, dad. "do you hear voices?"
yes. "are you quick to anger?"
right...
good...
put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.
hi. i'm michael jackson, from the jacksons.
i can't believe you've never heard of me. i'm a very popular entertainer.
michael jackson.
thriller?
thriller.
well, how about this? billie jean is not my lover / she's just a girl who says that i am the one / but the kid is not my son. hee, hee, hee!
the moonwalk?
hee hee hee... you seem like a nice guy. why'd they put you in here?
i understand. people thought i was crazy for the way i dressed.
one white glove, covered with rhinestones.
homer, this is floyd. he's an idiot savant. give him any two numbers and he can multiply them in his head, just like that.
forty-five.
we call this guy the chief. he's been here since 1968. never says a word, never moves a muscle.
hello. well, it's about time somebody reach out to me.
i could call them for you.
hmmmm, lobotomy...
forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty.
what's wrong, homer?
we all get scared once in a while. maybe i can help you. homer, the two of us need look no more / we both found what we were looking for / with a friend to call my own / i'll never be alone / and you my friend will see / you've got a friend in me.
okay, so i was working at an insurance company, right? huh! youngest vp in the history of the firm. okay? the job was my life. then one monday morning, i got up and i couldn't leave the house. i just couldn't.
no, i just couldn't face what was out there.
thank you. anyway, that day i knew i-i just couldn't make that long drive to work.
you mean there really is a bart? good lord!
mr. simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others.
of course.
i'm proud of you, homer.
well, how about today? i'm only here voluntarily.
homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose.
um homer, i'm a vegetarian. and i don't drink.
and the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital.
huh?
i thought so. oh, bart, you...
this is my real voice. my name is leon kompowski and i'm a brick layer from patterson, new jersey. all my life i was very angry until one day i just talked like this. all of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and i was only doin' good on this earth, so i kept on doin' it. to make a tired point. which one of us is truly crazy?
mr. simpson, i can assure you this "check" of yours is non-negotiable.
you see where it says "void-void-void" and "this is not a check"? "cash value one twentieth of a cent"? "mr. banker, do not honor."
well, at least we got a free sample of reading digest.
no, it is not the truth, homer. it's well documented that women are safer drivers than men.
hey, einstein. put down your readin', it's lunchtime.
hey, you don't wanna eat? what'd ya do, get one of them stomach staples?
but irrigation can save your people, chief smiling bear.
important.
hey, what gives, man?
homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article.
homie... put down your magazine for a minute...
i thought you might want to snuggle.
where did you get the idea for this, mom?
it certainly has enriched our lives.
very.
thanks for driving me to the contest, dad.
"so burn the flag if you must. but before you do, you'd better burn a few other things. you better burn your shirt and your pants. be sure to burn your tv and car. oh yes, and don't forget to burn your house. because none of those things could exist without six white stripes, seven red stripes, and a hell of a lotta stars." thank you very much.
are you a professional writer?
could you touch your nose for me? lisa, after meeting your father, i've decided to award you an additional five points. congratulations. you and your family are going to washington!
yes, sir. can i get you something?
oooh, look, homer. the irs.
homer, look! they give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow.
mommm!
good morning. this is your wake-up call.
sorry fatso.
lisa? i'm faith crowley, patriotism editor of reading digest.
these are special vip badges. they'll get you into places other tourists never see.
"on this spot, richard nixon bowled back-to back-300 games."
folks, we print more than eighteen million bills a day. oh, and in case you were wondering... no we, we don't give out free samples.
i'm too excited to sleep. anyone up for the winifred beecher howe memorial?
thank you!
lisa, what's gotten into you?
extra! extra! feds nab rotten rep!
miss crowley, thank you for this over-sized novelty check. i would like to share this honor with all of my fellow essayists. particularly the courageous lisa simpson, whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
why homer, you silly goose! the weed whacker's just for the edges! you're gonna be out here all day!
you are a picture and a half! well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. we're gonna fire up old propane elaine and put the heat to the meat! nummy nummy num!
i think it means he's having a barbecue.
he's trying to be friendly. you know, if you gave ned flanders a chance --
we can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --
oh, homer.
and so the saskatchewan rough riders, who scored only four rouges all last season, jack, get the kicker they so sorely need...
you lie like a fly with a booger in its eye.
friends, we love you all, but i also have a "sinister" motive for asking you all here -- "sinister" being latin for "left-handed." but enough joking.
well sir, like one out of every nine americans, i'm left-handed. and let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. your writing gets smeared. lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission. well sir, i'm opening a one-stop store for southpaws. everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. i'm gonna call it the leftorium. so homer, i'm dyin' to know. what do you think of the leftorium?
well, i know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too.
oh, here, you two. make a wish.
it's fun.
you must have something you want to wish for, homer.
come on, homer! i got an ambition to do some wishin'!
no, no, no, don't say. otherwise it won't come true.
yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
that sounds fine, bart.
absotively posilutely.
dad, do you know what schadenfreude is?
it's the german term for "shameful joy" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others.
sour grapes.
so bart, what did you learn in karate school today?
uh, i learned the touch of death.
uh-oh. gotta get back to karate class. you missed a spot. all right. comin' through. outta my way. move it along. step aside, lady.
today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
pinking shears? let's go to the food court and steal some baked potatoes.
hey homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?
crummy right-handed corkscrews! what does he sell?
ah! look, smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. and what's your name?
oh! it's a real one! "no more apples in the vending machine, please." well, that's almost a sentence!
oh, of course. and don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. nobody will take away your precious apples.
now, now, now. tell my secretary i said you could have a free apple. she'll make everything all right, i promise. damned infernal gizmo. my kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
come on, homer. tell him about the store. i'm dyin' out here.
hey, i'm flexible! you don't have to pay all at once. i'll be here all night if you change your mind.
oh, yeah. sure. thought i'd just get rid of some of the clutter. see anything you like?
ah, got your eye on the gas grill. she's a butane beaut.
twenty? homer, i paid three hundred dollars for this just last year.
oh, homer, be reasonable.
all right, homer.
twenty dollars.
what?
sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old daddly-doodly.
homer, this is the flanders' entire living room set. how much did you pay for this?
good afternoon, sir, i'm chuck ellis from the springfield collection agency, and i'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills.
oh.
we don't make mistakes. damn right-handed ledgers... can't write in these things...
hey, you said you're homer simpson?
homer! over here!
well, there's no house to put it in, homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up.
listen to that singing... those poor fools. homer, i'm ruined.
you know at times like these, i-i used to turn to the bible and find solace. but even the good book can't help me now.
i sold it to you for seven cents.
you know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. it's like there's been a-a curse on me.
no it's not.
no! you tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... i didn't listen. homer, you were a true friend.
for two more days. then it becomes libertarian party headquarters. i hope they have better luck than i did.
oh, homer, there's no point...
hurry, neddie, hurry! oh golly, it's a miracle!
homer?
homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. but you made us friends.
no one wants your stupid police badge, bart.
hey, that's my badge, homer.
bart, your father and i don't want you doing that. homer, say something.
thirty bucks a week.
good for you, chief.
no.
they're not mine. my boss said his warehouse was full.
hey kid, you look good with that cigarette. kind of sophisticated.
homer, i want you to go down to that club and talk to them. just see what kind of people they are. please, homie?
i am thrilled you've decided to let your boy continue to work here.
homer, what did you find out?
oh, bart. why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys.
mr. simpson, you've been the boy's father for ten years. do you really think he could be the leader of a murderous criminal syndicate?
principal skinner!
cool!
well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us.
dad, i think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and larry king.
well, a bit overly familiar, but i'll allow it. i took in a movie. an appalling little piece of filth. its leading lady was a blonde harlot who spent half the film strolling around naked as a jaybird. just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time.
five minutes before critical mass.
one minute to core meltdown.
now homer, this may very well save your life one day. this, homer...
please pay attention. this button here controls the emergency override circuit. in the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button.
simpson?
do you see which button i'm pushing?
fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
yeah, we owe you one.
simpson -- monty burns. come with me. now, now. that will do. homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up! and to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our wall of fame... oh, and uh, what's this? a congratulatory phone call from earvin "magic" johnson.
is this really homer simpson?
wow. homer, i just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust.
i don't care.
don't worry. sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are.
a role model in my very own home. how convenient.
how are you enjoying your ham, homie?
maybe you ate a clove.
i had a fight with milhouse.
how zen.
looking at you with quiet awe.
ah simpson! there's someone i want you to meet. aristotle amadopolis, owner of the shelbyville nuclear power facility.
they've lost their zest for work. you must help them find their eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!
we want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of homer simpsons.
he's just a little nervous. he has to give a speech tomorrow on "how to keep cool in a crisis."
hey, i had to give a speech once. i was pretty nervous, so i used a little trick. i pictured everyone in their underwear. the judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.
just picture them in their underwear.
three minutes to meltdown.
just do what you did before.
thank you homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. do you even know what button you pushed?
god bless that clown.
milhouse. you can come in and drop the charade. krusty, you don't have to be "on" tonight.
ohh, that's a relief. go wait in the car.
well, alright. i'm a little rusty, but um, i'll try. baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz.
no, dad, that's hebrew. krusty must be jewish.
dad, there are many prominent jewish entertainers including lauren bacall, dinah shore, william shatner, and mel brooks.
yes, it's just that saying the brucha brings back a lot of painful memories. the old days... my... my father...
come on...
don't worry, i don't even like using the bathroom after you.
do you have any yearbooks?
homer, maybe you better take milhouse home.
and, to conclude this halloween newscast on a scary note, remember: the presidential primaries are only a few months away.
trick or treat, man.
hand over the candy, old dude, or we egg your house back to the stone age.
we're home!
heh heh heh...jackpot!
oh yeah, three bad nightmares.
i can do that but i don't wanna.
it is a monkey's paw, dating back to allal ben abdallah. it has the power to grant wishes to its owner.
sir, i must strongly advise you do not purchase this. behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. i myself was once president of algeria...
ugghh, homer. where did you get that ugly thing?
you must pay a fine of two american dollars.
peace on earth.
homer, there's something i don't like about that severed hand.
oh, my land!
okay, no more fooling around. paw, this is bart. i wish for the simpsons to be rich and famous.
yaaayyy!!
oh homer, this is awful.
i wish for world peace.
jeez, now we're slaves. this paw sucks.
hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?
hey, homer! this little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. now that i've saved the earth, maybe i oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead.
good morning, dear.
much better! oh good, the curtains are on fire!
okay.
i want to watch krusty.
yayy!
homer, i see you agree with my theory.
well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. i want you to spend some quality time with him. get to know him. maybe even love him.
good night, dad. you know, these last few days have been really swell. i wish there was something i could do to repay you.
you got it.
i love you, dad.
can we sleep with you?
yes!
attention homer simpson. attention homer simpson. wake up, homer.
you're fired.
for sleeping on the job.
we've been watching you on the surveillance camera.
hey, here's a good job, dad. oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor.
hey, dad. here's one. twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people.
deeper. wider. faster. i wouldn't bury me turtle in that mud puddle. ah, what's the use?
did you have a nightmare, homie?
hey, man, you were crushing me. i tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.
perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? well my body was crushed so i had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner.
but homer, tonight's our reception for queen beatrice of the netherlands.
dad, i'm calling about the school talent show.
no. dad, i broke my last saxophone reed, and i need you to get me a new one.
i called her. she's not home. i also tried mr. flanders, aunt patty, aunt selma, dr. hibbert, reverend lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement.
why don't you go there first?
sorry, homer.
what's the matter, buddy?
i happen to be that moron.
let me think about it... eh... no.
okay. okay. but now we're even. so what does your daughter need?
uh-huh. and what instrument does she play?
clarinet?
oboe?
saxophone?
oh yes, of course. it's the reed. let's hear it for lisa simpson and her wacky sax.
okay, who ordered the mount bellyache?
i'm done.
i'm sorry dad, i don't feel much like eating.
i forgive you.
did you hear that, homer?
homer, if you want to make up with lisa just spend some time with her.
homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. if you keep spending time with lisa, she'll forgive you.
we can't afford to buy a pony.
that's ridiculous.
that's no reason to buy a pony!
stick to the subject.
let's be realistic. a pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
you sound like you're going to buy a pony. promise me you won't.
what was that? was that a yes or a no?
those aren't even words!
oh my, what is that smell? oh, it's you.
uh, sure pal, right here.
very good. that stunning creature over there is half a million dollars.
he was sired by seattle slew and his mother won the kentucky derby.
his likeness graces a stamp in tanzania...
mr. simpson, do you have half a million dollars?
mr. simpson, this check is dated january 1, 2054.
our ponies start at five thousand dollars. cash.
simpson, eh? how can i help you?
it's a hobby. i'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. by the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws?
silly me, i must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. now, what is the purpose of this loan?
isn't that cute? smithers, he's planning on joining the horsey set. that is it, isn't it? you're not planning to eat it?
shut up, simpson.
mr. simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony?
i am very upset with you.
hey, how come lisa gets a pony?
i don't love you either. so give me a moped.
homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?
that's illegal.
dad, i think princess belongs in a stable.
father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived.
wait, dad, i've got something for you.
hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. we're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.
actually, i was thinking we could cut down on your beer.
then i'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
homer...
all right. you got us into this, you get us out.
here you go.
oh congratulations, mr. homer!
if i could just see the ticket...
please to be removing your thumb.
yes. please, i must insist...
i've got to look at the ticket
yes, i must...
a cherry! oh, mr. homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery?
well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my "help wanted" sign.
yes. we need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift.
you're hired.
i won't lie to you. on this job you will be shot at. each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor.
here's a pointer: try to take it in the shoulder. now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. they are strictly ornamental. there's only one bozo who comes in and buys them.
homer, where have you been? i was so worried.
oh my god, she killed him.
homer, are you stealing squishees?
homer! you are asleep at your post! now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.
homie, how long do you plan to do this?
i just called to say i love you, dad.
well, it's still fun to be up late. hey, homer, where ya goin'?
hey, pink hat, when i ordered that blueberry squishee, i meant today.
and fill it to the top this time.
dad, you don't have to do this.
dad, i understand the sacrifice you've made for me. that's why i gave up the pony.
hmmm hmmm. there's a big dumb animal i love even more than that horse.
i mean you, you dummy.
products you could only imagine before. the foam doam...the jet walker...mr. sugar cube...
troy, i've brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul edgar allan poe. yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore. not so fast troy! with one application of spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm.
hey, dad, you got a power drill?
i'm offering three bottles -- enough to clean one thousand tombstones -- for only thirty-nine ninety-five.
hey, homer, i can't find the safety goggles for the power saw.
okay. i'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of kansas jell-o mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five.
homer, be nice.
no, next to him. mary... tyler... moore.
homer, are you ordering junk off the tv again?
who's using the power tools?
well, we're going to the beauty parlor. maybe you should do something with the kids while i'm gone.
yes.
everything.
uh... take us to the video store.
you want to rent it, sir?
but, dad, i can't find "happy little elves in tinkly winkly town".
homer, could you turn off the tv? there's a little test i want you to take.
this is from the national fatherhood institute. it evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
question one: "name one of your child's friends..."
they want a name, homer, not a vague description.
hank?! hank who?
homer, you made that up. question two: "who is your son's hero?"
that's your hero. "name another dad you talked to about parenting."
what are your son's hobbies?
he hasn't done that since he was two.
oh really? well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see.
what?
no, not really.
building a soap box derby racer.
hey, so it is.
you're also fat.
national fatherhood institute. dave speaking.
in between some other projects. well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, i've booked some time at the wind tunnel.
for starters, mr. simpson, won't you take this complimentary copy of "fatherhood" by bill cosby.
mr. simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son.
why don't you ask him yourself? homer, meet dave jr.
thanks, dad.
homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. it took years of effort.
aw, that's the spirit, mr. simpson. now step one is to find an activity the two of you can share. does the boy have any interests?
your son. find something he likes to do and share in it.
thanks, but i'm almost done. why don't you get back on the couch and watch tv?
sorry dad, but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad's help.
come on dad, it'd be weird.
ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes.
fine. hey, simpson, where's your loser-mobile?
you didn't hear nothin'.
dad... i don't know how to say this, but i don't want to drive your car. it's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...
dad, i love you, but you taught me to win.
well, i picked it up somewhere. and if i drive martin's car i can win. i'm sorry, but...
dad, can you take me to dr. hibbert's office?
oh, nothing. i just scheduled a tetanus booster. maybe i'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there.
tell me something i don't know.
dad, aren't you coming?
now, don't pout.
dad, you gotta come. i just got your hat out of the fridge.
don't you at least have something to say to bart?
but i guess i was wrong. you are a bad father.
good morning, everybody, and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the great depression -- the soapbox derby. in just minutes, these junior al unser juniors will lock horns.
hey ho simpson.
well sir, there are two schools of thought...
forget about your father. you're driving for me now!
thanks, mr. beck. i was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... this is for you, dad.
mom, i never won before. i may never win again. nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
tonight, we solute the silver anniversary of the great springfield tire yard fire. twenty-five years and stilll burning strong. ...we watch springfield's oldest man meet springfield's fattest man...
whoa, t and a.
lisa's slumber party. who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush!
because i'm "jinxed" dammit! ow! what was that for?
there he is! let's give him a make-over.
come here, maggie.
hiya, homer.
ah, business is slow. people today are healthier and drinking less. you know, if it wasn't for the junior high school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.
increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
take it easy, homer. i learned how to make other drinks at bartender's school. gin and... tonic? do they mix?
aye carumba!
they say everyone can float in the dead sea, but selma sank right to the bottom.
whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. what do you call it?
okay, why don't you make us up a couple of "flaming homers"?
uh, let me check the lost and found. what do we got here, bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye... oh. here we are. it's not without its charm.
hey, hey, this drink is delicious! and my phlegm feels looser. what do you call it?
i'll be back.
pardon me, are you the genius behind the "flaming moe"?
honey, what's wrong?
homie, why don't you just go down to moe's and talk to him? i bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you.
can i help you sir?
your name's not on the list.
okay, what's your name?
not on the list.
hit it!! well there's a back seat lover, that's always under cover, and i talk to my dad, he say/ he said, you ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin and you're sure to be changin' your ways/ i met a cheerleader was a real young bleeder oh the times i could reminisce/ to the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin and they started with a little kiss/
hiya, scrumptious. do you want to ignite my drink?
single parent, are we?
well, let's pretend you are.
oh, hiya, homer. how 'bout a beer?
a what? oh, i get it.
homer, i'm sorry you're mad at me, but this isn't personal. this is business.
what? i'm sorry. homer, i couldn't hear you.
what?
homer, you're gonna have to speak up!
i lost myself to what?
homer, i'll talk to you tomorrow.
yeah, what do you want?!
okay, then.
well homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
i moe, i moe.
of course. all work and moe play makes moe a moe moe.
what the...
homer, no!
ah, she left to pursue a movie career. frankly i think she was better off here.
oh, hey, hey. maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret.
compliments of the house. one "flaming homer".
i'll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir.
i know how you feel, simpson. i've never seen mr. burns so depressed.
people think that because he's rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn't have feelings like other men. but he does. and you know what? i bet he wouldn't sell the plant for a hundred million dollars.
good, good. try to eat something.
homer, it's your stockbroker. your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years.
yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights.
wait a minute. let's not do that yet. the book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. everybody alive?
like any sports?
ever go dancing?
we should get together sometime.
there. now we trust each other.
near death. i'm renewing my notary license on a weekly basis.
let me punch that up on the computer. twenty five cents a share.
well, let me put it this way. you'll get twenty-five dollars if you sell now.
hey, homer. wanna duff?
yeah, but thank you anyway.
we are interested in buying the power plant. do you think the owner would ever sell it?
we'll have a savings account. we've never had one. kids, i think everything is going to be okay from now on.
oh, homer!
we heard! isn't it wonderful? we have some great plans for that money.
what do you mean?
you spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
hey, homer.
ich bin ein springfielder!
well, they can't fire me. i'm the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier.
why?
what is the best way to an efficient plant? happy workers who feel secure at their jobs. so let's get to know each other better. do we have any alcoholics among us? you'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in hawaii, after which you'll return at full pay.
also, we cannot uber-emphasize the importance of employee safety. we plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.
one of the economic powers of the world--
homie, come to bed.
don't worry. whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow.
well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?
yo, homer. you gotta get ready for work.
homer, could we have a word with you?
i must have phrased that badly. my english is, how you say... inelegant. i meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat?
once again, i have failed. we request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange of ideas.
you've been safety inspector for two years. what initiatives have you spearheaded in that time?
i see. then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.
such as...
we understand homer. after all, we are from the land of chocolate.
mr. simpson...
mr. simpson...
that was ten minutes ago!
i want you to take baths, bart.
ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. hold your nose, smithers, we're going in! watch me blend in. barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my "buddy" here.
homer simpson, sir. sector sieben-gruben -- i mean, sector 7g. recently terminated.
yes.
why, no.
no, it doesn't.
that was no accident. let's get out of here.
"barnacle bill's home pregnancy test"? homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?
okay, let's see... "ahoy maties! if the water turns blue, a baby for you. if purple ye see, no baby thar be".
"if ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail". well, i guess i'd better go see dr. hibbert.
well, i have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix i did with the other kids.
is anything wrong?
is mom gonna have another baby, dad?
ohhh, cool, we can race them.
doesn't mom do that stuff?
were you like this when mom was pregnant with me?
homer, you're turning the blades too fast. the golfers are complaining. slow down! that's better. ah, beautiful. keep this up and someday you'll be the guy who hands out the putters.
it's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, dad. we watch an appalling amount of tv.
homer, do you ever think about the future?
no, i mean how you plan to earn a living. i can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating.
i think about you, too.
you light up my days / and fill my nights / with song.... it can't be wrong / when it feels so goo/right / cause you -- you our song.
actually, she was singing about god.
you don't have to do that.
homer, maybe it's the champale talking, but i think you're pretty sexy.
what if we get caught?
i need you to drive me to the doctor, homer.
well, that unforgettable night we... joined the castle club...
son, you gotta marry that girl!
well, i haven't said no to you lately, have i?
what card?
is this it?
"marge, from the first moment i saw you i never wanted to be with anyone else. i don't have much to offer you... except all my love. will you marry me?"
oh, homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
yes.
kool moe dee.
homer, i've been thinking. if the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name larry?
well, how about louie?
bob?
luke?
marcus?
what about bart?
yes sir, and how will you be paying for it?
basic ceremony's twenty bucks. here's your license. be sure to get this punched every time. the tenth wedding is on the house.
there certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
homer, i'd be lying if i said that this is how i pictured my wedding day... but you are how i pictured my husband.
dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of god and this casino to join...
homer, same question, names reversed.
what a perfect day.
homer, i don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary.
i don't know. i heard radiation can make you sterile.
okay, that'll do.
that's enough! next: there's a problem with the reactor, what do you do?
did you get the job?
oh, homie. hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking.
... you, gentle sir, are fired!
oh, hello, young man.
hey, who wants to get rich today?
"fourth notice"... "90 days overdue"... "we break thumbs"... homer, what are we going to do?
repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
shut up with that pen-scratching down there!
that is so sad.
hey homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?
that's right. all the colors of the rainbow.
my husband by my side.
homer?
homer!
homer... come home with me.
any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
aww... would you mind if i took it off now? the oil is burning my finger.
homer, do you know why i married you?
that's it. that's it. come closer... ironic, isn't it. the hunter has become the hunted. oh god, smithers, i feel so alive.
i don't care. i haven't been this impressed since i first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named waylon smithers.
welcome aboard, son.
you're a little late. she's gone to the hospital.
i'll drive you.
right where you left it.
hey, listen fatboy --
homer, does this mean --
good god.
doesn't your job start tomorrow?
uh, why don't you let me handle it, homer?
homie, isn't he beautiful?
homer, i'm not pregnant.
dad, can i have some money to buy bart a birthday present?
dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars.
we're gonna roll this truckin' convoy / cross the u.s.a. / con-voy...
hey good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later.
you're fired!
but order now, supply is limited.
ehhh...
fine.
here you go. enjoy.
quit it, dad!
i'll get some at the store tomorrow, homer.
we have captured your president. he was delicious.
uh-huh.
bart! what's wrong with you?
how do you mean, dad?
how does that make him a hero?
so i'm afraid your son is trapped down the well.
ow! knock it off you bald boob!
like to see you fit.
so it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. the time has come for finger-pointing. and most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
homer!
mom, it's too big.
you know, i've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. i guess now i'm paying the price. but there's so many things i'll never get a chance to do. smoke a cigarette, use a fake i.d., shave a swear word in my hair...
actually, i don't know if i've ever heard bart play one of your albums--
man, i was so scared.
now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart.
but if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, i don't know... uh... denver.
moe's tavern. where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
oh, sure thing, moe. i was just using it as a coaster.
pleasure doing business with you, h. s.
look, dad. i made a modest studio apartment for my malibu stacey doll. this is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter... daaaaad! you're not listening to me.
ho, look at that score. moxy!
wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time.
i certainly do, brett. i hereby declare miami to be smooth jimmy's "lock of the week."
in the cincinnati - miami game, i declare cincinnati to be my "shoe-in of the week".
you want some of this don't ya?
well you need to know the winners. and i know the winners. so call me now! whoa! five dollars for the first minute. two dollars for each additional minute. you have reached the coach's hot...
line.
in the game of mi-a-mi...
...versus cin-
cin-
nat-
ti...
we must consider many things. the wind...
...is blowing out of the west...
at five
knots...
touchdown dolphins!
all right, dolphins!
whoo-hoo!
fifty big ones?
you mean you made a bet?
what could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
see how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
so gambling makes a good thing even better.
and the final from riverfront stadium, miami 24 -- cincinnati 10.
boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars.
really, where?
did you two have fun?
goodnight, dad. i had a really nice time today.
can i watch football with you again next sunday?
this team is fired up! we came here to play!
he'll lose.
look at the fear in his eyes. listen to the quiver in his voice. he's a little boy, lost in a game of men.
i'd bet my entire college fund on it.
dad, i hate to break the mood, but i'm getting nauseous.
oh doctor, what a finish! the final score -- atlanta seventeen -- houston thirteen. and the lowly falcons are flyin' high. who would have thunk it?
yeah, me!
c'mon, dad. it doesn't take a genius to realize that houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game.
you know, dad, sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week.
okay, ya lucky moron. here you go, homer. a hundred and thirty-five dollars.
look at these prices. we could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
hello, i'm marco. i'll be your waiter.
charming lad.
the broken neck blues.
well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. still, that is a real fan.
dad, i'm making the chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. and with your blessing, i'd like to tie it to the cowboys plus five at chicago.
hey homer, you wanna go bowling next sunday?
oh dad, you must've bought me every malibu stacey accessory there is.
ooh, perfume. meryl streep's "versatility."
homer, those are very thoughtful presents. but you have to tell me where you got the money from.
i promise i will get mad, because i always do when you make me promise i won't.
homer! i did not! i promised i would get mad! she's an eight-year-old girl.
but gambling is illegal.
well, i just don't know.
you know, dad, we've been watching a lot of tv lately. maybe, the sunday after the super bowl, we could hike up to the top of mount springfield. the fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets.
what about daddy-daughter day?
so you've come to buy my forgiveness. sorry, homer.
yeah, i did.
well, i would like to see what all the fuss is about.
put me down. look dad, i'll tell you who's gonna win the super bowl if you want me to. but it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me.
i think dallas is a mortal lock.
however...
however, i may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously i want you to lose. in which case, i'd bet the farm on buffalo.
oh, this sucks. c'mon snipers. where are you?
wow!
dallas kicks -- oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. buffalo's going to start with excellent field position.
whatcha got riding on this game?
hey homer, didn't you say if duff dry wins, your daughter loves you?
okay, okay. they're both great teams.
touchdown cowboys!
so, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. if dallas scores here, happy fans'll be looting and turning over cars in the lone star state tonight. here's the handoff.
what are you so happy about homer? you didn't win any money.
come on, dad!
isn't it though?
extra mustard for bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... light mayo for lisa, cut off the crust... double bologna for homer....
videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, homer's dry-cleaning -- i think that's everything.
homer, i'm running late as it is. can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?
where's my lucky red cap?
try to talk her out of there. but don't put your lips on it or anything.
homer? is that you?
how about, "yes, it's me".
tell her you love her.
why don't you just wrap it up?
homer
i need a vacation.
i need to unwind.
no. i mean a vacation by myself.
no homie, no. i still love you. a lot of couples take separate vacations.
i swear.
wish i'd thought of that.
uh-huh. he'll probably trade her for a beer and a nudie magazine.
goodbye, homie.
check the dryer!
whenever she needs it.
then just push nine on your phone. then the pound sign. then four-eight-three. we'll do the rest.
no problem. well, well, if it isn't little bart. remember your uncle barney? hey homer, let me hold him.
oh man, you want a bad night, try sleeping on one of these.
don't worry, don't worry. you know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna make you an omlette.
are you sure? i make 'em with two kinds of cheese.
hey, homer. i think i've got her. come on!
what do you want?
wait here. and don't steal any light bulbs.
dad!
uh-um.
homer, that's awful!
you the man who reported the lost baby?
can you describe her?
bingo!
not so fast! you're wanted on three counts of criminal neglect.
hi, did you miss me?
and from now on i hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
maybe we should let the dog in?
i think he needs a dog house.
i'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
i am not!
oh, i don't know...
you've got a date with a xerox machine.
of course i saved them. although actually there's only one. and it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited.
he's not getting it from his brother, that's for darn sure.
homer?
i'm afraid i have a bone to pick with you.
no, i-i came to talk to you about your potty-mouth.
look homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. so, i don't want to be hard on you... but i just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys.
what's wrong with my moustache?
what?
okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. i'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?
well, you know, maybe he's right.
actually, homer, you brought up ned flanders. i never said a word --
no, you're not. when my father got out of the navy, he used to curse a blue streak. it almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. so, my mom put a swear jar in the kitchen. every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. what do you think?
yes, homer.
no, homer.
yes, homer.
i can't help but feel partly responsible. homer, that was a twenty.
hey homer, ya know, i owe you one, buddy. no sooner had i shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial. ah, i tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal.
how's the dog supposed to get in?
dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse.
there was more than enough in the swear jar. and if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise.
no, behind her.
mrs. krabappel.
homer! bart, you did a very cruel thing.
no, homer. the truth would humiliate her.
maybe we should write her another letter. one that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
that's disgusting. and besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face.
"i must finish this letter quickly, for i have only four minutes to live."
oh, that's very good, lisa.
how shall we end it?
ohhh, homer, you old honey dripper.
hey homer, slow down. you're gonna choke or somethin'.
hey, look at this. softball starts this week.
homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight.
actually, it was.
what's that? a home-made bat?
homie, come to bed. homer, go back to the garage.
wow! how many home runs you gonna hit with that?
okay, homer, bases loaded and you're up. where's that secret weapon?
and i got an enchanted jock strap.
no, i want to get him a beer.
one more outburst like that and i'll send you back to the big leagues!
yes.
yes.
so?
you hit so many home runs this year. what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better than you?
you make me sick homer. you're the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it.
that's impossible no one can give more than one hundred percent. by definition that is the most any one can give.
yes!
wait a minute, are you ken griffey jr.?
you heard me, hippie.
aw, nuts!
oh, homie. you're good at lots of things.
like snuggling...
to the game.
all right, tie game. bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, strawberry coming up...
you should be very proud of yourself. sit down! simpson! you're batting for strawberry.
all right, simpson, let's go over the signals. if i tug the bill of my cap like so...
...it means the signal is a fake.
however, i can take that off by dusting my hands thusly.
if i want you to bunt, i will touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice... got that simpson?
now batting for darryl strawberry, homer simpson.
wait till next year. if i'm still alive.
lisa, it's not that bad.
that's nice, bart. you know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. but they said he was too heavy.
honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help.
you're wrong, you're wrong! you don't need long fingers to play the blues. the blues come from in here! my god, they are stubby.
no no, sir, we're here to pick up your son. he's coming on a ride-along.
bart's grades are up a little this term. but lisa's are way down.
we have three kids, homer.
no, maggie!
you know, i heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars.
yes, yes, here's your lottery ticket. thank you for knocking over my inventory. please come again.
but we never ever...
i buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. we each play our birthday. and that's enough excitement for me.
homer, we're on a tight budget here. promise me you won't get carried away.
you can still win some money if you have five out of six.
homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one.
give it to the poor.
what are you gonna do, homer?
hey homer, what'd you do? get a haircut or something?
oh i know what it is. you're the biggest man in the world now. and you're covered in gold.
the first number is... seventeen. and the second number is... three.
yeah, i knew we wouldn't win.
grampa, he's not dead!
this is the part of the job i hate.
this is never an easy decision. it's an awful lot of money.
i can't help but notice we're leaving the hospital. when's the dog going to get his operation?
is there a doggie hell?
who's in there?
checkers.
we are not going to let our dog die! and that's it! lousy dog-killing sonsa...
please, do go on...
oh, please, continue...
no.
you are not going to perform that operation yourself.
i've found a way we can pay for the operation.
... will now be chub night.
we all have to make sacrifices, dear. maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer...
you wouldn't want what he's eating. it's mostly just snouts and entrails.
yes, i'm back. kent brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. hey, i'm a journalist.
what's that?
c'mon boozehound! you want the twenty five cents, don't you? keep singin'!
before his dog got sick, that "old rummy" used to be my best customer.
go get it, pal.
homie, did you close the gate?
the dog will get out!
it's all my fault. i called him a dumb dog.
i'm looking for something in an attack dog. one who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh. why here's the fellow! wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. reminds me of me.
poor santa's little helper. i'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
homer get a-hold of yourself. even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. remember doggie heaven.
i'm not giving up. i don't care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. i'm gonna find my dog.
you already petted him for ten minutes.
you can pet the cat.
oh, there's a spot, dear.
that spot says "compact only".
uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad.
"honey, i hit a school bus"!
