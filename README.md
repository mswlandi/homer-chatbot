# homer-chatbot
A ChatBot made to imitate Homer Simpson, using tf-seq2seq

## How?
We used the "[Simpsons by the Data](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data#simpsons_script_lines.csv)" dataset, which contains script lines from approximately 600 episodes, to train a seq2seq model that imitates homer simpson.
~~if everything goes wrong, we will use a doc2vec model~~
