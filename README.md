# homer-chatbot
A ChatBot made to imitate Homer Simpson, using tf-seq2seq and doc2vec.
This was made as a final work project for the Formal Languages and Automata class, at UFRGS.

The results, as well as a cool presentation of the project as a whole, can be found at the project's Google Colab Notebook.
