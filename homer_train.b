oh.
and?
hey, just because i don't care doesn't mean i don't understand.
me?
did you hear that, marge? she called me a baboon! the stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!
go away. lisa, don't hold anything back. you can tell me. are you crying because you called daddy a baboon?
nuts. this isn't going well at all.
no, no, no. i just wish i knew what to say. although, maybe this will help. now you lost someone special and it hurts. i'm lucky because i never lost anyone special to me. everyone special to me is under this roof.
i can hold these nails in place with my tail.
gimme a banana.
come on, you're holding out on me.
think nothing of it. hey, what's the matter, son?
would you have to do extra work?
and is this martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?
so, let the baby have his bottle, huh? that's my motto.
holy-moly... talk about parenting! uh oh. sleep well, maggie. ah, three for three.
i promised i wouldn't eat? never! you lie!
oh son, when you're older, you'll know better. hmmm. oh, baby! mmmm. yeah.
how do i look?
do we have enough gag ice cubs?
why not? i paid for it. hey, flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?
really? well i do have a warm sense of well-being and i seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! give me another.
no.
oh, dr. hibbert. enjoying the party?
you little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?
bart, do that thing you do that's so cute.
that thing you know how to do.
go to bed. hey, everybody! look, i'm the funniest guy in the world!
you stink! you and your whole lousy operation stinks! i quit!
all right then. could you... give me a handful of peanuts... maude?
not those peanuts. the ones at the bottom.
why? what'd you do? marge!
the way i acted?
i put it there.
i slipped it into your glass as a gag.
i'm sorry, honey. can't we just forget it and go to church.
i admit it. i didn't know when to say when. i'm sorry it happened and i just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
aw.
marge, marge.
sorry, reverend.
oh, well, it's very tempting. really a wonderful idea. marge! what are you doing? are you insane?!
they're holding it at catfish lake. they couldn't call it catfish lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
oh dear. if we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. what a kick in the teeth.
no, you don't!
catfish lake.
wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. who's general sherman?
oh yeah.
whoa, who says that?
hmmmm. gentlemen: i am going to catch general sherman!
none of your business, flanders. uh say... uh... reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
oh.
i see. i also understand bowling expressions.
ohhh, because i got drunk and looked down her dress.
she's perfect.
well, sometimes that can be annoying.
i'm done.
sorry.
i only did that a couple of times.
would this be a good time to be honest?
you're right, i am. help me, marge. what do i do to be a good guy?
to those weirdos in the worm store.
well, if that's the way you feel... i'll throw it back.
watch. wow, i did it! i gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. i fought it for six hours. she says one word and i toss it back. and you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? come here, baby.
same as usual. perfectomundo.
i was just kidding, marge. hey, what does everyone say to dinner at krusty burger? my treat!
all right, what are you getting at?
a hundred bucks?! for a comic book? who drew it, micha-ma-langelo?
well, t.s.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no! now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, i give in, so i'm not mad at you for trying. it shows you've been paying attention. but we all know i'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. now are you gonna stop bugging me?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
hee hee, i win! in your face! yeah! how do you like them apples? woo hoo hoo!
bart! what are you staring at?
hey, what's all the -- my beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
what's the problem, boy?
hey, when i was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.
nah.
they're fine.
joke's on them. if the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign.
i can't believe you guys. there's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. and you don't wanna cash in? that's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job.
sorry, sir.
aw, nuts! extremely rare blood and i don't have it.
earmuffs.
aw, old man burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some double-o-negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it.
woo! yes! all right! woo! congratulations, boy! you've got a date with a needle!
yeah, probably. anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. and all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. so they got hercules, and hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave hercules this big thing of riches.
it was the olden days!
now let's get the show on the road.
eh.... the boy.
it's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check.
"better half," marge. "better half."
marge, you're my wife and i love you very much. but you're living in a world of make-believe. with flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...
bart!
good. "you are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."
an elephant's butt.
yup!
forget it, marge!
hmmm... oh, marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. y'know, i finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph.
where's the letter?
well, it's somewhere! it didn't just get up and walk away! bart, have you seen the letter?
all right, think very carefully. where did you see it last?
yeah...
why did you do that?
i'll show you mad in the morning.
she's right. okay, think, homer. don't panic. they don't pick up the mail till noon. there's still time!
what does it look like? i'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.
so a few people won't get a few letters. boo-hoo. you know the kinda letters people write: "dear somebody-you-never-heard-of... how is so-and-so? blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. yours truly, some bozo." big loss. now bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. just give me some kind of signal.
that's a good one. we'll use that.
uh, uh i-i guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?
i don't know. great plan, bart.
lisa, i don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry.
homer simpson.
yeah, well i'll be on my --
okay, here's the plan. you can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. and i'll... die in a gutter. it's practical and within our means.
i got my problems, moe. give me another one.
mr. burns, you brought us a present.
what did i tell you? i'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...
marge! really, what does it do?
save a guy's life, and whattaya get? nothin'! worse than nothin'! just a big, scary rock.
wait a minute. if i hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!
exactly. it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
who stole my shirt? who stole my shirt?
oh thank you, marge -- pink? marge, i can't wear a pink shirt to work. everybody wears white shirts. i'm not popular enough to be different.
oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! oh no... pink. pink! pink! it's all over, marge. it's all over.
you! you did this to me!
you don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
print name?
all right, all right. i'll get lisa to do it. lisa, you like homework. could you fill out this form for me?
o-kay.
son, it's no different than the time i let you vote for me. remember that absentee ballot?
look at him!
awww.
dog on fire! dog on fire!
bart! shut up or i'll shut you up!
that's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. they're gonna eat it.
arrghh!
who are you?
oh, of course i've heard of you. i mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?
doesn't ring a bell.
what was that last one?
nope.
no, that thing with your feet.
because i wore a pink shirt.
what'd you wear?
bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
wowww.
hey, chief.
gee, i gotta call my family. oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. i mean, they think i'm a god.
oh great! and uh, try to put a good face on this. tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight.
what's that?
this place is so strange. mike, i'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but i'm... scared.
pancakes... football... boobies...
was the door locked?
were you out of gas? baby.
mmm... pancakes.
that's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. could i have it in writing, please?
not insane.
you are? why?
now listen. i'm bringing michael jackson home to stay with us for a few days... isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice.
are you sure you're here voluntarily?
thanks everybody! it's great to be sane. here he is! here's the guy you wanna see.
come off. i'm sane now.
not me. i got this.
oh yeah? well, what makes you so damn sure?
shut up.
oh, marge. cartoons don't have any deep meaning. they're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh.
nah, you go ahead.
as tolstoy said in "quotable notables," "give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."
marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. god forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds.
we're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival. then i heard the sound that all arctic explorers dread: the pitiless bark of the sea lion. he'll be killed!
don't be so... oh, you're right.
hmph?
that reminds me! "seven ways to spice up your marriage." marge, you have a nice body. and if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask.
wow! "win a trip to washington d.c."! "all expenses paid... vip tour"... oh. it's for kids.
ooh... and miss? just one more question --
sweetheart, there's nothing i wouldn't do for that magazine.
yeah! damn right!
woo hoo! who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else i've got coming to me.
booooo!
wowww -- a shoehorn! just like in the movies! shoe goes on, shoe goes off. shoe goes on, shoe goes off. shoe goes on, shoe goes off.
wake-up call? it's two am!
free food?!
ooh! i love your magazine. my favorite section is "how to increase your word power." that thing is really, really, really good.
miss? what does the "i" stand for?
lousy cheap country...
who's that?
bart, are you ready to go to... i'll room service you...
yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'.
give her the check! i was serious.
i'm almost done.
i'll be there. not-y not-y not.
well, why doesn't he just say so?
excuse me? better? thanks a lot, marge, you really put me in my place.
don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. marge simpson... president of the international we love flanders fan club...
stupid flanders... always showing off. go ahead, marge, have a ball... what if they game back and i was dead from not eating? they'd cry their eyes out. we should have never gone to the flanders'. oh, why did we go to the flanders' house and leave homer all alone with no food. and i'd be laughing. laughing from my grave. what is it, boy? what? mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que. hey, everyone, i'm back! great to see ya! nice seein' ya!
the fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
uh... sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
fun? where is this store, flanders? the merry old land of oz?
nah.
no, it isn't.
keep your pants on, flanders! i'm wishing as fast as i can! ooooh.
oooh. that would be a shame. wouldn't it, flanders?
marge, tv gives so much and asks so little. it's a boy's best friend.
see, marge? you knock tv and then it helps you out. i think you owe somebody a little apology.
no, i do not know what schadenfreude is. please tell me, because i'm dying to know.
oh, come on, lisa. i'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. he's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... what's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?
boy, those germans have a word for everything.
yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks.
hey, boy. how was class?
oh, that'll learn 'im.
hey flanders, when are your busy hours?
lousy. he just sits there all day. he'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
homer simpson, sir.
can i leave, mr. burns?
but the note was asking you to --
um, mr. burns...
hey, flanders. is everything okay?
oh, i get it. it's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! well, i wouldn't be caught dead buying this... hello!
i'll give you twenty bucks for it.
you were swindled, my friend. twenty bucks. take it or leave it.
twenty dollars?
now i don't want it.
i changed my mind. it was a passing fancy. although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.
daddly-doodly.
oh, i know i need to pay them. but there's just so many.
flanders is in debt? are you sure?
uh, there's a store where...
yeah.
you're gonna live in your car?
i know!
why not?
oh.
yes it is.
no, i was a swine. listen, flanders, do you still have that store?
flanders, you open that store tomorrow!
i said do it! hello, jerry? homer simpson. remember last month, when i paid back that loan? well, now i need you to do a favor for me.
it's all here, and it's all backwards. that's right.
to ned flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
hey, look what i got. a genuine official police badge... calling all cars... come out with your hands up!
that's officer homer. heh heh, heh, heh.
pfft. i make more than that.
... bart! have you started smoking?
don't lie to me boy. aha! cigarettes, just as i thought.
yeah, right. son... i'm gonna teach you a lesson. i'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. then maybe you'll learn...
oh, all right.
you know if you need a hat check girl, i've got a daughter.
marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding.
wait till i get you home, boy.
i thought he was dead.
hey, when do we get the check for this?
you know who the real crooks are? those sleazy hollywood producers.
hey, this is the only paper in america that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine.
critical wha...? okay, okay, don't panic. whosever problem this is, i'm sure they know how to handle it. huh? ahhh!! it's my problem! we're doomed!!!
shut up! simpson, it's all up to you. it's showtime! okay, okay, think back to your training...
yes.
ooh, a side.
yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it. this is all your fault! okay, gotta pick a button. pick a button. pick a button. uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... no, wait! bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? no, no!
eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... eenie meenie minee... moe.
hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. you just have to read the manual and press the right button.
magic johnson! y'ello.
well, thank you.
uh, magic. what if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?
thanks, magic.
look, i get enough admiration and respect at work. i don't need it here at home.
what's your problem, boy?
that four-eyes with the big nose? you don't need friends like that.
what? what is it? what are you doing?
well, as long as it's quiet.
their eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
but i really can't tell them anything, sir.
what am i gonna do? what am i gonna do?
did it work?
whew! saved by the bell.
all right.
sure. moe.
you think it's him?
we could have seen a monkey.
he's talking funny talk.
a jewish entertainer? get outta here.
mel brooks is jewish?
yeah, krusty, tell us.
why you little...
no, that's it. you've seen everything.
gladly.
hey, aren't you a little old for this? you're not even wearing costumes.
here you go, kids. lousy punks...
get a good haul this year?
i am very, very proud of you kids.
eeuhgh. what is this thing?
oh yeah? how much?
c'mom pal, i don't wanna hear your life story. paw me!
why at that little shop, right over... there. oh no, wait, it was over there.
forget it, you two. as the pants- wearer of this house, i get the first wish.
marge, don't flake out on me. that monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true.
ooh, a luxury car. good baby. good maggie.
now you're talkin'!
come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. i thought he was just being colorful.
lisa, that was very selfish of you.
ok, ok. i'll make a wish that can't backfire. i wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, and...and! i don't want any zombie turkeys, i don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and i don't want any other weird surprises. you got it? hey... hmm. not bad. nice hot mustard... good bread... turkey's a little dry. the turkey's a little dry?! oh foul, accursed thing! what demon from the depths of hell created thee?!
yeah, but i gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... yeah, that's what it is. wanna try it? heh, heh, heh.
hiya bart!!! how's my boy! heh heh. heh heh.
it's good that you made that awful thing, bart. it's real good.
he gets it from your side of the family, you know. no monsters on my side.
shut up boy. if they make this field goal i win fifty bucks.
i'm not nodding. it's the air conditioning.
ouch! good night, son.
well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.
oh, ah, thanks boy.
you both toilet-trained?
well, okay then... ... four o'clock... coupla hours i have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work.
huh? what?
for what?
camera?
how hard can it be?
ooo, what job is that?
sheesh. what a slave driver.
i gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
i didn't wake up. it's all a dream. it's just a dream!
umm. spaghetti.
oh, i hate having two heads.
uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
wow! and after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.
hey, do i tell you how to do your job?
you know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top.
oh, me and my trenchant mouth.
okay, okay. but i want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. well i don't have one.
i'll have you know, i wrote it down. number four and a half -- stupid gum! number four and a half reed! whoo hoo!
i dunno.
no.
no!... wait a minute. what was that last one again?
yeah! woo! woo! yeah!
i ordered it for my little girl. heh... heh.
look, i let you down and i apologize. i know that doesn't make it right, but i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
you didn't mean that!
no wonder she hates me. i never even noticed that she was alive.
okay. maybe i should just cut my losses, give up on lisa, and make a fresh start with maggie.
marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony.
marge, i've got to get her a pony. when i look in lisa's eyes, i don't see love anymore.
see, even when you yell at me, i can see love in your eyes.
ha ha, you love me.
mm.
buh.
sneh.
excuse me, do you sell ponies?
half a million dollars?!
wow!
i'll take it!
uh, sure... let me write you a check.
isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
mr. burns, you do this personally?
u-su-ry?
i want to buy a pony.
sorry.
of course.
sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
because she stopped loving me.
i've got it all figured out. by day it will roam free around the neighborhood. and at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
that's for the courts to decide. marge, she loves me.
stable? that sounds expensive. this is what love costs a month?
oh nuts.
well you know, we're always buying maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have.
nah, we're not gonna be doing that.
first you didn't want me to get the pony. now, you want me to take it back. make up your mind.
marge, lisa loves me, the pony stays.
liberty bell... two liberty bells... come on, come on, come on... oh. yes! whoo-hoo! three liberty bells! that'll be ten thousand dollars, apu.
thank you.
there it is.
no.
no! you can't see... come on!
no! let go. you're ripping it.
ohh... i need money.
you're looking for help?
woo-hoo!
...badge of honor.
but i eat... oh.
marge, could we go in the other room? i did something last night i'm not proud of and i don't want the kids to hear it.
no sir.
yes sir.
i don't know. how long do horses live?
thanks. when is she gonna stop loving me?
coming right up, sir.
yes, sir.
yes i do. you see lisa, grownups have a thing called money...
you did?
awww. apu. you can take this job and re-staff it!
that baby changed our lives.
oooooh! that's one clean tombstone.
in the garage.
if stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
okay, okay, calm down.
okay, i will. i will. patty, selma, what a pleasant surprise.
... expiration date: june, 1999... uh, 2012, yeah.
i don't know. some guy i guess.
oh sure, great idea. i'd love to -- did you hear that?
how much?
what's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?
why? i just saw the best part. oooh, "death by knockout," "blood on the ice" oh, oh... "football's greatest injuries". lisa, we're going.
just grab something. all these movies are great.
oh great, you made me miss joe theisman.
oh marge.
okay. hank.
hank... jones.
steve mcqueen.
next.
then he has no hobbies.
bart!... bart!!!
you don't have any hobbies, do you boy?
well, that's what i... wait a minute. what are you doing?
oh, my god. i don't know jack about my boy... i'm a bad father!
i'm also fat!
i'm homer simpson. i just took your test. i got a zero.
goodbye, son.
well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. how much do you see your son?
huh?
oh, how i envy you!
i've never been afraid of a little hard work.
well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.
okay. no, i'm gonna do it.
but you can use me. i'm good. i've built a lot of things around the house... the spice rack... the birdfeeder... the gymboree. what was that? ah, who cares. son, please let me help you.
oh this isn't working at all. it's hopeless... wait a second. hmm... "cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: no matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite." huh? oh, that sounds too complicated. all right, i will! son, i don't think you should let me help you.
loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!
are you nervous son?
bart, the car had a few bugs in it, i admit that. but we're team simpson.
when did i ever teach you that?
why? what's wrong?
oh, sure, i'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. this is how you get your kicks, isn't it, lisa?
dr. hibbert, lisa needs a. you! homewrecker!
no!
sorry.
no. can't think of a thing.
leave me alone.
name your son's hobbies. building a soapbox racer... "name your child's friends." martin... martin! i'll curse that name 'til the day i die... huh? "who is your son's heroe?"... three-time soapbox derby champion ronnie beck! wow, i'm one question away from being a perfect father. "name another dad you talked to about parenting."
great, thanks. i talked to flanders about parenting. i'm a perfect father. hold on, son, i'm-a coming!
do it for your old man, boy!
no, son, you earned it.
that's my boy. nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!
bart, why are you still up?
boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. sheesh, what an ego.
what is it, boy? is anything the matter, my son? talk to me, young man. say your name? why should i do that, my lad?
you spoke while you were jinxed so i get to punch you in the arm. sorry, it's the law. heh, heh.
that's it. i'm outta here.
what's the matter, moe?
yeah, things are tough all over.
could i get a beer?
as i stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, i knew i needed a drink. patty, selma, would you excuse me for a moment?
i don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.
a "flaming homer".
hey moe, you got any cough syrup?
well, it's called a "flaming...
moe, i haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. do you think my drink had something to do with it?
why yes i --
i'll tell you what's wrong. that rotten moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him! take that off this second!
i need to talk to moe.
i didn't even tell you my name.
homer simpson.
but--
you're my kid's teacher!
no!
get away from me. hey, moe?
i'd rather have a "flaming homer".
business, eh? well let me tell you something. you just lost yourself a customer!
i said, you just lost yourself a customer!
you just lost yourself a customer.
you just lost yourself a customer, moe!
you just lost yourself a customer.
a beer?
can i have a clean glass?
oooh! look at me, i'm making people happy. i'm the magical man from happyland in a gum drop house on lollipop lane! oh, by the way, i was being sarcastic.
moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe...
fools! you poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your flaming moe's. all the time wondering, "how does he do it?" well, i'm going tell you. the secret ingredient is...
cough syrup. nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!
moe, sorry i lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
ahh. thanks, moe. you're the greatest friend a guy could ever have. hey, do you think aerosmith will be in tonight?
it's not fair!
uh-huh.
ooh, that's a lot of money. uh, mr. smithers, do you have change for a dollar?
i own stock?
so uh, how much did it go up?
yeah...
sure...
that'd be great.
well... how are you?
uh-huh. so what's my stock up to?
what should i do?
no, i'd like a bottle of henry k. duff's private reserve.
hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?
well, i happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars.
hey... hey!
well, i'm afraid i had some great plans, too.
i spent it on beer.
fifty-two hundred dollars? what are you talking about? what? i sold it all for twenty-five bucks. ow!
did you buy this car with your stock money?
well, they can't fire me.
cuz... i...
lucky drunks.
yeah! sock it to him, horst!
oh, marge, i'm gonna be fired. i know it.
marge, it's not the money. my job is my identity. if i'm not a safety whatchamajigger, i'm nothing.
ooh, battlestar galactica. fit, damn you! fit! there.
huh? what?
no!
auugghh!
uh... all of them?
i sure do!
mmm. the land of chocolate...
la la la la la la...
oh, oh, oh. i'm sorry. we were talking about chocolate?
i think i did pretty good in there.
i'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!
that's right. i lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars. let me ask you something. does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
okay, bad example. so let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?
and does it ever say, "i love you?"
na na na na / na na na na /
but marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe.
well, what color is it? blue or purple?
oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?
no, everything's fine. your mother uh, just, broke her leg.
maybe.
yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. for me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings.
yeah, but i have to hear about it.
yes, sir.
don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. lousy, ungrateful... can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh... where do you think you're going? you're gonna listen to my story. your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
you mean like will apes be our masters?
but it gives me time to think. well, girls i mean i mean boys. i, i mean you!
i'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
oh. well he's always happy. no, wait. he's always mad.
phew, good.
really? it must be the champale talking.
why? what's wrong?
oh.
because it's the honorable thing to do?
marge, i... damn it, where's that card?
what's it say?
that's the card. give it here.
so... will you marry me?
woo hoo! woo hoo! yeah! she's gonna marry me. in your face, everybody... woo hoo!
marge, we can't do that! all the kids'll call him larry fairy.
they'll call him screwy louie.
slob.
puke.
let's see... bart, cart, dart, eeart... nope, can't see any problem with that. wow! i'll take that ring!
i don't know.
hey! this marriage is gonna last forever.
marge, i'm sorry. i wish i could afford a better place.
homer.
i do.
our first night together as man and wife.
hey, why don't i apply at the nuclear power plant? i hear they pay pretty well.
... little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.
there's a problem with the reactor?! we're all gonna die!!!
nah, they wanted someone good. story of my life.
wow! kid, i won't let you down. i swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job.
good evening, madame. you have been selected by the good people of slash-co to reap the benefits of their new nev-r-dull knife-edge. here... shake hands with the slash-co. handle first, handle first...
me! me! me! me! me! i said it first!
i don't know, i don't know --
"dear marge... by the time you read this, i will be gone. you deserve all the finest things in the world. and although i can give them to you, they will be repossessed and i will be hunted down like a dog. also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."
oh, c'mon, honey. you know how it turns out. after all, you wouldn't be here today if i hadn't become the responsible head of a household.
okay.
wowww.
you want fries with that?
marge! holy cow, you're as big as a house.
no, marge, i just can't. i mean, look at me. i'm a trainee... they won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. but i can't buy you a decent wedding ring.
marge, for you.
oh, sure.
you the boss?
you mean?
i got the job. i got the job! whoo hoo! only in america could i get a job!
the hospital?
shut up!
no, you listen! this is my wife and this is my kid, and i'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!
starting tomorrow, i'm a nuclear technician!
and tomorrow morning, i'm gonna buy your ring back! then i'm going house-hunting!
oh, college boy, eh?
hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me. ahh, bart. daddy's little angel. why you little... he did that on purpose!
yeah!!! whoa! excellent, marge!
mon-ey.
that could be bart!
he's in for some lovin'.
hm... bart's birthday's coming up.
limited?! do you have any of those microphones left?
bart! i would love to get a present like that.
listen, boy, this is a great invention! watch. we got a great big con-voy / rockin' through the night / we got a great big con-voy / ain't she a beautiful sight / con-voy
hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!
mmmmm. chocolate.
aww... just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
yeah, that timmy is a real hero.
well, he fell down a well... and can't get out...
well, it's more than you did!
hey, don't make me come down there!
why, you little --
it's not our fault. we didn't want the boy, he was an accident.
uh, could you edit that last part out?
that's all i can stands, i can't stands no more. i'm gonna get you outta there myself.
shh! marge, he's a good digger.
don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again.
well, bye-bye belt.
whoo hoo! denver, yeah!
moe, i'd like to bet twenty dollars on denver.
twenty big ones on denver.
all right, denver. justify my love.
why did you do that?
okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there. over. over... over... over... lisa, please, i can't hear the announcer.
why didn't you say that before!
oooh, that's a big lock all right. i just don't trust that guy.
yeah!
line...
yeah, lay it on me, coach.
mm-hm.
cincinnati.
cincinnati.
c'mon, c'mon! don't you realize this is costing me money?
doh, not the wind.
... miles per hour.
ugh, this is ridiculous. what am i supposed to do? lisa, who do you think's gonna win? the bengals or the dolphins? good, good. moe, fifty dollars on the miami dolphins.
all right, dolphins!
whoo-hoo!
uh-oh. you see, lisa, daddy's friend moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the dolphins won the game.
well, i wouldn't call it a bet. it's a little thing daddies do to make football more exciting.
well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?
and don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. crumbled up cookie things...
yeah!
you'd think that wouldn't you. but you see lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. even though they say it's okay in the bible.
uh... somewhere in the back. the point is we had a great time today. and to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. okay?
you bet.
sure! you'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
all right!
what? didn't you hear what he said?
you think we should bet against them?
oh, sorry. so who do you like in the afternoon games?
my daughter, that's who!
lisa, you've picked the winner every time! you must have some kind of special gift.
oh, my little girl says the cutest things.
i used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. now it's the smell of victory.
tut-tut. only the best for my family.
hello, i'm homer. i'll be your customer.
oh, violin guy! what's your favorite song, lisa?
well, lisa, it's daddy-daughter day and daddy needs daughter's picks. you promised you wouldn't get mad!
good, good... you call moe.
barney, are you nuts? that's the super bowl. how about the sunday after that?
not quite. they were out of the malibu stacie lunar rovers.
all right, marge. i'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad.
all right. if you must know, lisa and i have been gambling on pro football.
but marge, she never loses. she's got a gift. aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?
only in forty-eight states. besides, it's a victimless crime. the only victim is moe, heh, heh, heh. and it's brought lisa and me together.
well, that sounds great honey, but next sunday i'm going bowling with barney.
don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.
look lisa, honey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings. but i really had a good time watching football with you. and i think you had a good time with me.
well, c'mon, we can still watch the super bowl together. can't we? eh? huh?
okay.
dallas! whoo-hoo!
however? what however? what do you mean, however? however what?
lisa, do me a favor. complete this sentence: "daddy should bet all his money on..."
don't worry, moe. i'm not bettin'.
buffalo's gonna win. lisa hates me!
my daughter.
not duff dry... dallas.
all right, we're back in business.
please, please, please...
money comes and money goes, but what i have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!
it's beautiful.
marge, i split my pants again. oooh, can i have two sandwiches today? make them bologna sandwiches too. can i have two slices of bologna and cheese...
marge, can you take my ball to nick's today? a bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole.
alley balls?
alley balls...
what should i say?
yes it's me!
i love you very much. and uh... later tonight i think you and i should uh, snuggle.
look marge, i can tell something's bothering you. but if you come out of that car, i promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. please, honey?
what? but marge, we just had a vacation. remember mystic caverns?
i know you do, marge. but come on, you know what our vacations are like. those three monsters in the back seat. "are we there yet? are we there yet?" and let's face it, i'm no day at the beach either. "marge, can i have another sandwich? marge, can i have another sandwich?"
what? you mean we're getting a divorce? marge, i can change!
well, okay. but you have to swear you're comin' back.
she's startin' to give.
for your information, i can take care of my -- see? got her on the first bounce.
good bye? where's my clean underwear?
how often should i change maggie?
c'mon, maggie. nummy, nummy num. mmm. strained peas. let go!
all right, but just be careful.
barney, i've lost the baby. it's the worst thing i've ever done.
just help me look!
barney! you're gonna pull her arm off.
i came to see the kids.
hmmm.
hey kids... uh... you haven't seen maggie around anyplace have you?
oh. well, i've got good news for you. the dog didn't run away.
yes.
uh... she's small... she's a girl...
oh maggie!
never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
you got it, sweetheart. you have enough blanket there?
marge, dogs love the outdoors.
yeah, but what're ya gonna do?
yes you are. you've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on tv. i know, i'll build him a dog house.
don't worry. i just drew up a little blueprint. now let me walk you through it. this is the door. he goes through that. this is the roof. and this happy character here is the sun. he shines down on the house, see.
stupid lumber... dammit! son of a -- the hell with this!
"maybe it's the beer talking, marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. they got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? get outta here."
what is it, flanders?
look, if this is about your camcorder -- i lost it, okay?
what the hell are you talking about?
oh come on now, flanders, i don't complain about your your... moustache.
people are talking... lots of people.
aye-aye! admiral butthead.
well what a surprise. marge sticks up for flanders! can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, ned flanders?
look, we're past that. marge, maybe i do curse a little, but that's the way god made me. and i'm too old to stop now.
what if i catch on fire?
what if i see something really weird in the sky?
what about when we snuggle?
god -- ohh, you son-of-a.
well, he just goes... ohhh
where'd you get the money?
maggie. oh. cute.
beer! how did you know?
boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.
oh, marge. i only said it because i thought that's what you wanted to hear.
step aside everyone. sensitive love letters are my specialty. "dear baby, welcome to dumpville. population: you."
i may hold you to that, marge.
p.s. -- i am gay.
how about, "with a love that will echo through the ages?"
why you little...
don't tell me how to eat donuts --
look, i know it wasn't our best season.
well, this year's gonna be different.
it's something very special. a home-made bat. it all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when i locked myself out of the house... sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, i ran for cover under the tallest tree i could find. something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that i could make a bat out of. i put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
and here it is.
check it out, boys. my magic bat.
yeah, just watch. woo hoooooo! ha ha. cops can't win!
kids, kids, kids. you can each get me a beer. but first let's see it again in super slow motion.
you're darryl strawberry.
i play right field too.
well, are you better than me?
marge, forget it. he's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than i do.
well now that you're a little bit older, i can tell you that's a crock. no matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you.
hey, i called for that!
no.
these guys aren't so tough. i've got "wonder bat."
please, please, please, i want to make the team. clemens, did i make the team?
yeah, but none of my friends can watch me.
no, no, no! i don't want you to see me sitting on my butt.
they're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me.
i am? whoo-hoo!
uh uh.
got it.
yes, sir!
huh?
so what're you gonna be, boy?
no, the army said i was too heavy. the police said i was too dumb.
wait a minute. isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?
look, i didn't steal that copper wire. i just thought they were throwing it out. here, take it.
we always have one good kid and one lousy kid. why can't both our kids be good?
maaarge... the dog doesn't count as a kid.
oh yeah.
one hundred and thirty million dollars!
i know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. go-get-all-your-money...
you don't understand, marge. the lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. uh, the lottery and you.
yes, money... i mean honey. ooooh! here comes a news report about the lottery! hey, down in front.
whoo-hoo!
what do kids know about spending money?
hmm...
look closer, lenny!
fourteen carat gold!
well why didn't you tell the rest of us? why did you keep it a secret??? if you were seventeen, we'd be rich! but no! you had to be "10."
dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.
hey, you did the best you could.
well... i guess we'll have to talk it over.
well... of course. there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
uh... hitler's dog... and that dog nixon had... whassisname... uh... chester.
yeah. and one of the lassies is in there too. the mean one. the one that mauled timmy.
but it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach... oh, come on! i'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. marge, make him stop.
i thought maybe you... oh. well, thanks for your time.
what?
but marge! it looks so easy! just like carving a turkey. maybe you're right, marge.
whattaya got, marge? insurance scam?
marge, i've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats...
mmm... snouts.
well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy.
a dinosaur.
and dance by the light of the moonnnnnnnn!
my quarter!!!
yes. oh, you mean tonight.
bart! close the gate.
uh...the last one.
that was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug.
oh, marge! there is no such place! or... to put it another way... there is.
and i'll be right here watching tv.
the cat? what's the point?
oooh, there's a good one.
marge, that's just a suggested car size. easy... easy... how'm i doing on the right?
uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. all right, everybody out the window.
that's right.
why marge, you frisky little devil. we'll take two tickets to "the stockholm affair."
political!
ah, this movie's too complicated... hey, the floor's sticky... who's that guy?... what did that guy say when i said, "who's that guy?" oh, that submarine's so fake... look, you can see the strings... ooh! an octopus! what?
marge, i have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. tonight you robbed me of it. i'm going now and i don't know when you'll see me again.
duff please.
okay, fudd me.
stupid marge tell me to shut up.
... that's true.
uh-huh.
that's right, except for the pick-up truck.
hey... hey, lurleen! i've gotta say somethin' to ya.
homer j. simpson.
that's a pretty name.
maybe. i'm not sure. i forgot it. bye lurleen.
i was just up at this bar in spittle county.
moe, i was a hundred miles outta town.
lurleen, i can't get your song outta my mind. i haven't felt this way since "funky town."
do you think i could get a copy of it?
lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!
i guess so.
shut up, boy. marge, what do you think?
well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. but she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady.
marge, you make it sound so seamy. all i did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits.
well, i was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now i feel kinda guilty about it.
thanks. you did say sugar, right?
really? well, i should warn you... i'm not great with figures...
i make a lot of stupid decisions...
my personal hygiene has been described as...
uh, then maybe you better not look at me.
a friend bought it for me.
no... i think it was lenny.
no!
a coupla times.
i can't. i'm her manager.
marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer.
i'm sure lurleen will love it.
calm down, marge, it's just our life savings. i'm not going to go into hock for this.
marge, it takes two to lie. one to lie and one to listen.
stop it.
hey! oh, you meant that as a compliment. now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. maybe we should give them something new.
let's hear it.
oh, that's hot. there isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. well, g'bye.
uh-huh...
uh... i gotta think about this.
later, marge. lurleen's on tv tonight. i gotta get ready.
that's great, honey. say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?
sure they will.
yes i am.
forget it, pal. they don't call me colonel homer because i'm some dumb-ass army guy.
is there anything you need?
my whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
i'm sorry lurleen. all i wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and i've done that. now i better get out of here before i lose my family. just so i don't wonder... you would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?
okay. now before we negotiate, i have to tell you i'm desperate to unload lurleen. and i'll take any offer.
you son of a... sold!
is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?
pfft.
ooooh.
gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, i'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton. lousy snitch.
i am not.
oooh, appetizers.
well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. they taste as good as they look. and they come in this delicious red sauce. it looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. but brother it ain't ketchup!
oh, would you two knock it off? i hate all the programs marge likes. but it's no big deal. you know why? whenever marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, i take a walk. i go to a bar, i down a few, and i stumble home in the mood for love.
hey, down in front.
to the simpson mobile!
wow, my concert going jacket still fits. and this is where i used to hide my beer. billy beer!
oh marge, i went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me.
i hear ya. come on boy.
i'll be right back.
well, that's a waste of money. we already have a guitar.
this is real.
now boy, we spent a lot of money. so you better get real good real fast or pow!
marge, what were you thinking?
oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape.
forget it. that line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
yes, but doesn't the bible also say, "thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut"?
it doesn't matter.
that's it. he's outta here.
i don't care. this is not "happy days" and he is not the fonz.
listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, i want you out of my house!
ooh, sweet.
i'd say "you're a lying scumbag." why sweetie?
oh lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter.
lose weight and listen to new-age music? wow! what do you think, marge?
lamentably, no. my gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety.
forbearance is the watchword. that triumvirate of twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
tut tut, gentle marge. for here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!
the vernal equinox?
yuh. yuh. yuh. yeah that's good.
go to hell.
oh, the usual. stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough...
herb?
well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when tv's brightest stars come out to shine!? oh, goodbye, old girl. we've had a lot of great memories.
boring.
well friend, you're going back where you came from. the curb in front of flanders' house.
yeah. you know, my life just can't get any worse. that's right. there's no way my life could possibly get any worse.
wait a minute. i'm not signing anything until i read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it.
don't i get some kind of trophy? at a big award ceremony?
please please please please please...
don't jinx it!
i miss my couch.
pfft! heavyweight championship. there's like three of those. that couch was one of a kind.
i think i'm gonna take a walk.
dammit, i said full power!
marge, there's an empty spot i've always had inside me. i tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. but those were dead ends. i think this chair is the answer.
all right, we won't get the chair. now excuse me while i kiss the sky.
you weren't so glad to see me.
well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?
oh, yeah. right. i don't know what this switch does.
they do good work.
broke again, eh herb? just like in real life. i guess you're just not much of a businessman.
wait, marge. didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?
twenty minutes?!
it's drinking the water!
this is the greatest invention in the world! you'll make a million dollars!
it's going back for more!
okay, then just give me the drinking bird.
herb, this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen. i can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks.
i try, but i can't.
i dunno, herb. people are afraid of new things. you should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something.
well, when is he gonna act like it?
what do i get? what do i get? it's not another punch in the face is it? because if it is, i don't want it.
that's it?
i see your point, brother.
well it is.
sure do. when you're eighteen, you're out the door.
now listen, boy. we have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. i don't think i'd be any kind of a father if you got d's and i let you go to kamp krusty.
son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers.
stupid roller-skate.
a+? you don't think much of me, do you boy?
you know a d turns into a b so easily. you just got greedy.
now, bart. we made this deal because i thought it would help you get good grades. and you didn't. but why should you pay for my mistake?
thanks son. now, you've got little hands. can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?
marge, am i crazy, or is my back getting hairier?
i don't see your name on it, boy.
oh yeah? check... mate.
oh no you're not.
he-he-he.
and look. new hair! i'm this close to having a comb-over!
size... right... agility!
sounds interesting.
sounds interesting.
a beaut from butte.
nothin' could be finah.
marge keep it down in there.
maggie! cut that racket! and where exactly are you going?
well, this is the first i've heard about it.
excuse me, marge. i think that if you told me i would remember! i mean i'm not an idiot!
match point, homer.
that's okay. we're none of us perfect.
bart, don't ask stupid questions. is there any frontal nudity?
make bart do it.
marge, your ride's here.
marge, can i get some change for the candy machine?
hey, there's quarters in here!
woo-hoo! come to papa! marge, i'll be out in the car.
wha th... why are you talking like that?
i'm livin' in a cuckoo clock.
but marge, what about dessert?
fine. i will! oh no! my pudding is trapped forever. so i can open my own can of pudding, can i? shows what you know, marge!
probably not much of it.
because i don't care, okay? i can't fake an interest in this, and i'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.
you know, the painting class, the first aid course, that whole lamaze thing.
you know i would never do anything to hurt your feelings. good night.
huh?
kids, wait in the car. i want to talk to your mother about this play thing.
shut up boy. marge, you were terrific.
i wasn't bored. i was sad. it really got to me how that lady -- uh... uh... you know which one i mean. you played her.
yeah, like when i pick my teeth with the mail and stuff...
don' wanna go.
too cold out!
oh, stupid itchy church pants... one size fits all, my butt!
you bet your sweet... ass!
i wear short shorts! the perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world moon waffles. let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke... oooh, waffle run off. mmm, fattening.
i know that! hello, this is homer simpson.
this things i believe.
heh-heh-heh... moe is their leader.
oh, well... can't win 'em all.
yesss!
woo-hoo! is that what i think it is?
like fun i don't. marge, i'm never going to church again.
no! no, no, no, no, no, no. well, yes.
hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every sunday? i mean, isn't god everywhere?
and don't you think that the almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?
marge, come to bed.
maarge... come to bed marge... it's good for what ails ya... i can wait all -- god?
well... kind of... but...
and you remember... matthew... 21:17. i'm not a bad guy. i work hard and i love my kids. so why should i spend half my sunday hearing about how i'm going to hell?
you know what i really hate about church? those boring sermons.
give him one for me.
so i figure i should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way.
sure, honey.
well, i wasn't sure i was doing the right thing. but then god himself told me i should seek a new path.
yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and i knew that was special 'cause i usually dream about naked... marge.
perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way.
yeah... think about it.
no sale.
leave me alone!
where are we going?
kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. he had long hair and some "wild" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. and that man's name was... i forget. but the point is... uh, i forget that too. marge, you know who i'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --
very sure.
wait a minute, is this a religious thing?
sorry.
hey ganesha, want a peanut?
flanders, you saved me. why?
that's right, old friend.
my magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone.
hey, wait a minute... flanders is a regular charlie church and god didn't save his house!
well, that's just great.
you know, i have a feeling there's a lesson here.
no, don't tell me, i'll get it... oh, i know! the lord is vengeful! o spiteful one! show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!
i was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that i am.
god, i gotta ask you somethin'. what's the meaning of life?
c'mon.
i can't wait that long.
no, tell me now!
a ride on the duff blimp...
wow.
ho-mer, ho-mer, ho-mer..
well, i want that one.
what are you talking about? heh heh heh... oh, lisa, this isn't real. it's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character.
now that's not true! you're cute as a bug's ear.
dad, am i cute as a bug's ear?
there, see?
i need help.
that could be lisa!
where'd you get all the money?
lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?
i sent in an application for you. i couldn't find a big enough photo, so i sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates.
but i think she'll win.
hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl.
well, if i could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, i would. but to me, she's beautiful.
i'll tell you when you're older.
hey... hey!
nope, that's it.
yeah! clean up this stink hole!
hmmm.
bless you boys.
i know.
i don't know. was i drunk?
will you remember this the next time i wreck your life?
oh yeah? with what? i mean don't worry, son. i forgot to get you a present. but i swear on my father's grave...
i will get you one now!
well, i need something for my son's birthday.
that's good.
that's bad.
that's good.
can i go now?
didn't even pull the string that time.
that doll tried to kill me!
don't leave me alone with him. my baloney has a first name / is h-o-m-e-r / my baloney has a second name / it's h-o-m-e-r.
marge, marge, look!
come here you.
did you walk the dog?
yeah, dogs like to bury old junk.
did i mention she was dead?
don't you remember? he went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
ooo.
did you wreck the car?
did you raise the dead?
all right then.
why? oh, the zombies. no.
to the book depository!
he was a zombie?
take that washington! eat lead, einstein! show's over, shakespeare!
man... fall down. funny.
well that depends on what your teachers say. if you've been good... pizza. if you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison.
oh no. i'm not making two stops.
i mean, no.
please marge... please, please, please, please, please?
woo hoo! u.s.a! u.s.a! u.s.a!
hee hee!
huh? oh.
bus-ted!
are you kidding? lisa turned out perfect. i won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing lisa!
oh. that guy.
then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on "60 minutes."
dad, you and your stories... "bart broke my teeth"... "the nurses are stealing my money"... "this thing on my neck is getting bigger"...
but marge, look at that hangdog expression. he's learned his lesson. let's get him a present.
all right, all right. young man, since you broke grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours.
thataboy.
bart, did you take out the garbage like i asked?
hey you goats, get outta here! boy, you're going to have to be punished for this.
run along, ya little scamp.
well, this time you must be punished.
no tricks, boy. i said i'm gonna punish you and come hell or high water i... wait a minute... ice cream truck! me, me. i was here first! now, what were we talking about, boy?
oh yeah. the trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
i'unno.
how could you let this happen?
oh. how convenient.
can't he be both like the late earl warren?
now who's being naive.
bart, didn't i ask you to watch maggie?
damn right. bart, you can't go to see that itchy & scratchy movie. ever!
don't point that thing at me. i said you're not going to the movie and i'm sticking to it.
hmm...
someday you'll thank me for this, son.
no, it's true. you know, when i was a boy i really wanted a catcher's mitt. but, my dad wouldn't get it for me. so i held my breath until i passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. the doctor thought i might have brain damage.
i like stories.
i know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but i can't go back on it. you're welcome to watch anything you want on tv.
but then i won't be watching tv. you can see the bind i'm in.
don't you think i know that?
ah, sweet soft-hearted marge. you just can't see the big picture. if i stick to my guns, the boy could wind up chief justice of the supreme court. if i fail, the best he could do is judge at a "mister tight buns" competition. i can't let that happen, i won't let that happen and i can't let that happen.
no, son, we both won. you don't know it now, but i've started you on the road to somewhere very special.
i'll get it son.
mmm... soylent green. which one's the mouse?
itchy's a jerk.
oooh, give it here.
i wish i could retire. boy, that'd be sweet.
can't talk -- busy.
all part of god's great plan.
the half-assed approach to foundation repair.
hand me my patching trowel, boy. hmm.
no.
wha-do i do...
wait a minute...
uh huh?
did you see the bubble?
forget it. you're not the only foundation guy in town! let's see, foundation repair... ah, here we are...
huh?
hey! then i could follow my dream. living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts. march 15... i wish i'd brought a tv. oh god, how i miss tv.
bo-ring!
bo-ring.
forget it marge. we already live together; we shouldn't work together. as the bible says "thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's... racket."
marge have you seen my lunch box?
yeah, lemonade is good.
wha dey do?
marge, marge, marge, let's file this under "r" for arrivederci.
you can't take our donuts!
oh, man, i really gotta...
i'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... tibor... i never thought it'd be my own wife.
are you kidding? i work like a japanese beaver.
i've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
no! mr. burns, i'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife.
damn right!
gotcha. marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice.
gonna run out the clock in florida, eh?
mmm... no.
mmm... no.
wha... hey, moose! shoo! go! talkin' to you! get off my lawn! now!
aye, aye captain! marge, we're going to that restaurant.
mmmm, shrimp.
my hammock! do you understand? mine! don't look that way.
shut up, you little monsters! hello, i was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels.
that's it! whew, i'm glad one of us remembered. that could have been embarrassing.
heh heh, i know what you mean. just let me make sure we're not talking about food.
right. me neither. we're talkin' about sex, right?
i hear you loud and clear.
can't talk... eating.
hey, hey, hey! but the sign said "all you can eat."
sorry marge, this is my quest. i'm like that guy -- that spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills...
no, that's not it. what's his name? the man of la mancha.
fine. i'll look it up.
never mind.
all right. hit the change of venue button. now!
so you think i have a case?
uhh... can't you see i'm reading the uh... ..._______ calendar? hmm... ooh, mostly mozart is in town.
but marge, i think he should learn about it the same way i did.
maybe you're right. now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.
son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. they're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! they smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! but you can't stop at one. you want to drink another woman! so i says, "yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause i don't know where it is you baloney..." you make me wanna retch...
hey!
right here.
but marge, alan thicke is throwing knives at ricardo montalban.
ohh.
what country is this car from?
nice meetin' ya! just keep moving. don't make eye contact. wow! just think what i could do with that plow.
mr. president, those young people are about to get a dose of reality.
well... i really should discuss this with my wife.
if you're gonna get mad at me every time i do something stupid, then i guess i'll just have to stop doing stupid things.
fine. i'll never ever do another stupid thing. good night!
no.
dear lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is klondike 5-3226.
hmmm. almost time for our commercial.
alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners...
it may be on a lousy channel but the simpsons are on tv!
stop!
hello, i'm mr. plow. are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?
then call klondike 5-3226. call now and receive a free t-shirt. he could still surprise ya!
absolutely! my prices are so low, you'll think i've suffered brain damage.
shut up, boy. so remember... call mister plow, that's my name! that name again is mister plow! well, john q driveway has our number. now we play the waiting game. the waiting game sucks. let's play "hungry, hungry hippos."
how do you think he'll do, moe?
cutting my nails? brushing my teeth?
oooh. heh heh heh. call mr. plow / that's my name / that name again is mr. plow. ah, white gold. what the... what happ... uh... oh no...
barney, you stole my idea!
flanders, i thought i was your plow man.
forget it pal. i don't need your phoney baloney job. i'll take your money but i'm not gonna plow your driveway.
oh, you want the mister plow who plows driveways. this is tony plow. you know... from "leave it to beaver"? yeah, they were gay. oh, what am i gonna do?
i know! i'll do a rap. i'm mr. plow and i'm here to say: i'm the plowingest guy in the usa / i got a big plow and i move a lot of things / like your cow it you have one.
i don't know.
i thought there was chocolate inside. well, why was it wrapped in foil?
hmm... hello... plow king? i was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding widow's peak.
there's a $10,000 bill in it for you.
well, i guess he just doesn't respect his customers.
kiss my asphalt.
hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat.
barney!
oh yeah? how dumb do you think i --
you mean... mr. plow, that's my name. that name again is mr. plow. our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on.
maggie, can you say "daddy"? dad-dy?
takes one to know one!
when the working day is done / girls just wanna have fu-un / that's all we really wannnnt...
homer is what grown ups call me. call me daddy.
daddy.
daddy.
why you little... he'll tire himself out soon.
heh, heh. got your nose.
nooo! bart, don't you ever do that again. understand?
we're gonna start doin' it in the morning?
marge that's...
no, we won't. i've got it all figured out. the baby can have bart's crib and bart can sleep with us until he's 21!
my cousin frank did it.
he became francine back in '76. then he joined that cult. i think his name is mother shabubu, now.
wow. how much? how much?
i can't afford that!
are you done?
dad, i don't need advice, i need $15,000 to buy a home.
dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. i'd be honored if you came to live with us.
about three weeks.
maggie i'll give you this cookie if you talk. what? what? all right, you win round seven.
your what-what?
wait a minute. that was a "lucy" show... okay, where were we?
ah yes. i remember the day we moved in...
bart, i told you not to use that word. call me "daddy."
hi, flanders.
whaat?
you said, anything.
and that "little while" is now eight years and counting. heh heh heh.
not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow i managed to fit in eight hours of tv a day.
all right, i know how to handle this. just use a little reverse psychology. let's go, marge. leave the baby with his little crib. ah, homer j. simpson, you're a genius. i know you like clowns, so i made you this bed. now you can laugh yourself to sleep.
patience, my pet.
wow. a baby and a free burger. could this be the best day of my life?
yes!
yeah, well bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.
where's the beef? no wonder he won minnesota.
i like those odds.
please, please, please, please, please...
here, bart, you can hold my beer.
what? goodnight, honey.
boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah.
no, sweetie. "daddy."
my heart is just fine...
just workin' the turkey through. there it goes!
you know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? i've got that right now. ooh... bacon!
it could only be one thing.
ooh, oatmeal. what a delightful treat. ugh, there's a bug in it.
trust me.
eh.
whew! i was afraid it was my transmission.
more. thank you.
marge, my whole life flashed before my eyes.
oh ni-ight, di- vine. hey, my voice just changed. oh night, when christ was born...
but i'm out of the woods now, right? i mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
stop. please stop.
please, have mercy.
not funny.
no! remember your hippopotamus oath.
hi.
woo hoo, look at that blubber fly.
say it in english, doc.
spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
hmm, have we deposited any forty-thousand dollar checks that haven't cleared yet?
well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge.
questions? questions? oh gee, my whole scheme down the... i mean, ask away.
oh, i thought that said, "brain hemorrhages."
now let me tell you something, mr. sucker... i just...
oh. i... must... sign... policy...
i made an "h".
looks like an "x."
i can't afford it. maybe i should buy one of those machines. oh yeah, that's the stuff.
no, but the rabbi gave me this.
son, they call it a "droodle". whoo hoo! look at him go!
bo-ring.
uh... some dog could do the operation.
kids, i have something to tell you.
really? what's it like?
well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and i'm not gonna sugarcoat it. so the tiny aorta fairies will take mr. leg vein on a long trip to get married to princess left ventricle.
kids. kids... i'm not gonna die. that only happens to bad people.
uh... he sold poison milk to school children.
hey, i'm just trying to make it easier on 'em.
flanders? what are you doin' here?
i got a bad heart.
shut up, flanders.
dear lord, i'm really scared about this operation tomorrow. if something happens, please look after marge, and make sure my kids grow up right.
sorry.
krusty, why are you here?
oh well, i could use a good laugh.
you seem okay.
gee, thanks, guys.
thanks, moe.
darn right. and to make sure, i want to be stuffed and put on the couch as a constant reminder of our marital vows.
bed goes up... kids, i want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. let's see... uh... oh, i'm no good at this. bart, the saddest thing about this is i won't get to see you grow up, because... i know you're gonna turn out great, with or without your old man.
and lisa... i guess this is the time to tell you... you're adopted and i don't like you. bart! but don't worry, because you've got a big brother who loves you and will always look out for you.
get to the money!
bo-ring!
woo-hoo, look at that pavement fly!
heh-heh... mule.
well, you should have written a song like that guy.
maybe.
what's it to ya?
does whiskey count as beer?
it's my life-long dream.
oh, yeah.
hmmm, false... no, wait. maybe it's true.
that's right, boy.
do you want to change your name to homer junior? the kids can call you hoju!
"what if?" what if i'm taking a shower and i slip on a bar of soap? oh, my god, i'd be killed!
we monorail conductors are a crazy breed. half in love with death -- gobbling up danger like ordinary men eat peanuts... am i turning you on?
what if i undo this button?
who, me?
woo-hoo!
i call the big one bitey.
i call the big one bitey.
i'm trying my best.
i did it!
y'ello.
batman?
yes, son. i'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was.
wowww.
bart, warm up the car. we're going to duff gardens.
now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?
but i wanna go to duff gardens. right now!
i'm not pouting. i'm... mourning. stupid dead woman.
ding-dong, the witch is dead.
patty. selma. i'm sorry.
legend of the dog-faced woman! oh, that's good.
what?
please.
it's just not fair, dammit!
uh, oh.
sure... unless another aunt dies.
boy, i don't know. you gotta be pretty desperate to make it with a robot. i knew that.
sand... wich...
two more feet and i can fit it in the fridge.
suggestion noted. marge, i'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment.
yes.
i don't care. i'm going to duff gardens.
but i love solids.
this is all your fault! oh, how can i stay mad at you?
no. what are the odds of getting sick on a saturday? a thousand to one.
yentl? whuzzat?
that yentl puts the "she" in yeshiva.
that's what you think .
the erotic adventures of hercules.
woo hoo!
you take an ordinary bed sheet, fold it around like this...
i'm on my way! what'd ya say, marge?
hmm, i keep thinking i'm forgetting something.
shut up, flanders.
it's that record club. the first nine were only a penny. then they jacked up the price! it's not fair, it's not fair i tells ya.
wasn't me.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
hit me.
hit me.
have a good time! wait a minute.
so that's it!
no, you haven't! you've been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! haven't you, haven't you. look at me.
uh... revenge.
ugly... wiener... crater face... soo-ee! soo-ee!... ehhh, maybe this was a mistake.
i'll take him! do you have him in blonde?
pepi!
oh, he is. son, i just want you to know i love you very much.
mmm... grapefruit.
because it's a stupid piece of junk! well, i'd better get you home. what's the matter?
well, there's... jerry, the cowboy. and that big dipper-looking thing is alan... the cowboy.
i love you too, pepsi.
pepi.
i gave it to pepi.
he's my little brother. that's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.
liar!
stop it. stop it. stop it!
no. come 'n' get it. woo! heh, heh, heh. come `n get it. woo! heh, heh, heh. stupid dolphin. hey! he's got my hotdog! oh... it's you. so, you're looking well.
for your information, i'm his father!
look! there's another disadvantaged boy.
oh. right.
thanks, son.
yeah?
kick him in the ribs...
step on his neck, and run like hell.
happy... valentine's day!
woo hoo!
what a nice idea, son. it's uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. i'll just go get it.
what? that's highway robbery! i won't pay it!
forget it, pal!
all right. but i'll never shop here again.
i'd sell my first-born son.
you'll do as your told.
ah, sweet pity. where would my love life have been without it?
let me handle this, marge. i've heard 'em all. "i like you as a friend," "i think we should see other people," i no speak english"...
and if that doesn't work, six simple words: "i'm not gay, but i'll learn."
can you believe flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush? eww.
she's in the can. go away.
really?
sure it is, honey. you do mean stealing, don't you?
your conscience? lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do.
oh, shaddup.
where?
c'mon, boy! finish him off!
woo hoo!
yeah, syrup is better than jelly.
where's your science fair project, boy?
the man never drank a duff in his life.
like what?
why not?
no.
barney, give me your keys. you're too drunk to drive.
okay, you leave me no option.
i'm trying to knock you out.
gulp.
stupid bicycle. can't believe this. no good, rotten... i guess it's not all bad.
it's funny `cause i don't know him. heh, heh, heh.
my name is homer and i'm just here because the court made me come.
does the lord count as a person?
thank you, that'd be nice.
do i ever! ah.
you name it.
you got it. no deer for a month.
all right. starting tomorrow, no beer for a month.
i was saying "pssst. i love you."
well, beer... we've had some great times. when i was 17 / i drank some very good beer / i drank some very good beer i purchased with a fake i.d. / my name was brian mcgee / i stayed up listening to queen when i was 17.
hm. alcohol fueled car. one for you... one for me... one for you... one for me...
i never realized how boring this game is.
i would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
the other day i was so desperate for a beer i snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
nooooo!
but marge, the barflies are expecting me... moe, and barney and that guy who calls me bill...
yoink.
put it in the fridge, moe. i got a date with my wife.
it's just a movie, son. there's nobody that evil in real life.
don't worry. we won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. that's where i got this scar.
where's my burrito? where's my burrito? where's my burrito?
thanks a lot carl. now i've lost my train of thought.
if we give up our dental plan, i'll have to pay for lisa's braces. people stop! we can't give up our dental plan! lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth.
you know what i think of this contract?
hey, what does this job pay?
woo hoo!
and make life-long connections to the world of organized crime. hmmm... organized crime.
eh-eh-eh. molto bene. that's-a-nice-a-donut.
well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, mr. burns or me.
done and done! heh, heh, heh.
hey, lenny, can you get this sugar daddy off my back?
who is it?
who?
hired goons?
you know, you could have just called me.
gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.
which way to the bathroom?
nope. nope. nope.
uh... yeah.
yeah, you're right. guys are always patting my bald head for luck... pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh...
ya know, i think you're right. first thing tomorrow morning, i'm gonna punch lenny in the back of the head.
who keeps saying that?
woo hoo!
woo hoo!
woop, woop, woop! woop, woop, woop!
haw haw. april fool's.
you talk better than you fool.
ahhh, what noble visionary thought up april fool's day?
god bless those pagans.
happy new year!
oh, right.
whew! it's a good thing that beer wasn't shaken up any more, or i'd have looked quite the fool. an april fool, as it were.
so thirsty... eh. what're you gonna do?
mmmm... beer.
marge!
arrrgh!
ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god.
i love you too, son. you know, boy, i don't think i've ever felt as close to you as i do right -- i'm going to make it! i'm going to make it! this is the greatest thrill of my life! i'm king of the world! woo hoo! woo hoo!! i--
get 'em off me! get 'em off me! get 'em off me!
no! no! beer bring pain!
tell him i'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman i love. and i won't be back for ten minutes.
i can't.
mmm... chocolate.
i know you're a good man... and i have a dog that's very sick...
i thought maybe you... oh. well, thanks for your time.
no. let me hear you play.
does a father have to explain? let's just share your gift, okay? yeah, that's more like it! "oh, i want to be in that rumba / when the saints go over there.... over there... over there."
why, you little --
me lose brain? uh-oh. why'd i laugh?
marge, it happened again!
marge, i ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom.
i never passed remedial science one "a".
marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay.
i don't know. i flunked latin, too.
it'll be great to see the old gang again... potsy, ralph malph, "the fonz"...
look, there's bobby mindich, the class clown.
richard nixon.
i'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
hmmm.
ed sullivan.
oh my god!
i discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
yes!
marge, i have my pride. i'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!
i never graduated from high school.
oh, you have a job?
i see.
will this be on the test?
nooooooo!
this is not happening. this is not happening.
true.
false. all right, brain, you don't like me and i don't like you. but let's just do this and i can get back to killing you with beer.
at our next high school reunion i'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
not me!
hey kids. how was school?
no son of mine is gonna be a 19th century cockney bootblack. we're gonna find you another school.
marge, it's too late. the boy's ten years old! let's focus our energy on lisa and the other one. what's your problem?
woo hoo! the greatest day of the year.
maybe so, lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved.
yes, honey.
just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. like that day i hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. remember that?
your daddy hit the referee.
yeah.
lisa, maybe if i'm part of that mob, i can help steer it in wise directions. now, where's my giant foam cowboy hat and air horn?
gotta get a juicer. gonna drink juice, lose weight. won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore.
woo-hoo!
my name is mr. burns.
i'll miss sheriff lobo...
i'll miss sheriff lobo...
lobooo...
lobooo...
mmm... pie.
marge, i'm gonna miss you so much. and it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. but mostly, i'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning.
marge, please. i'm having enough trouble with the lobsters.
we're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course.
uh... no.
honey, i don't know what you're feelin' right now. so i don't wanna push anything. we can just hold hands... or sit and talk...
yeah.
i figure it's some guy's name. some guy named gabbo.
he'll tell us what to do.
two wrongs make a right, lisa. ah, rex morgan m.d., you have the prescription for the daily blues.
hey, moe, can i look too?
my wallet's in the car.
ooh, delicious.
ooh, five cents each! junk... junk... the airplane's upside down... strad-i-who-vius?...
i'm surprised you don't remember, son. it was only eight years ago.
who cares? anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... a maturing joe piscopo left "saturday night live" to conquer hollywood... people express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and i was in a barbershop quartet...
every afternoon at moe's, chief wiggum, principal skinner, apu and i would get together and sing... and the crowds went wild.
bart, what did i tell you?
goodbye...
really?
run along, boy. you're free now!
get off the stage!
barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?
the be sharps.
well, one of us made some money. i sold a guy our spare tire.
hmm... baby on board. baby on board / something, something burt ward... this thing writes itself!
wait'll i tell marge!
well... if i explain it to marge that way, i'm sure she'll understand.
i stuck him somewhere.
we'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. she's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons.
i meant the statue.
oh my god. oh my god! where did you get that brownie?
well, you haven't heard the last of them.
i miss you too, honey.
oh. thanks. here.
they took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. but if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. bart!
well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--
shut up!
hi, kids... i love
i pity the fool who doesn't like... he. and wher's barney?
we all went our separate ways.
i'll give her a good home.
there are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. now off to bed.
i'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and i hope we passed the audition.
oh. i wrote that one, after bart somehow put this tattoo on my butt.
it's probably the person you least suspect!
yeah.
oh no!
go home.
woo hoo! did you hear, bart? oh.
ooh! i wanna be john elway.
woo hoo!
shut up, boy.
ooh, ice creamville.
check.
i got ya.
i think he's talking to you.
everything is a source of fun...
i tied him up, out back.
relax, marge. i tied up all the loose ends before we left.
oh it is not.
why? oh, right. the sideshow bob thing. sorry, boy.
ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies.
oh, geez, i told you, bernie. to guard the bee.
the bee bit my bottom. now my bottom's big! oh!
what the hell are you talking about? what do i do!? what do i do!? in the name of god you've got to tell me!
just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.
must destroy mankind! ohh, lunch time.
bart!
maybe you're right. i did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way.
that dog has somebody's ham! this i gotta see! c'mon! gimme the hand, you stupid dog! c'mon! gimme' that!
is "tv guide" a book?
katharine hepburn's "me"?
i suck. ... it was the most i ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.
thanks boy. now, for the crowning touch...
relax, a photo can't make any difference.
i hate that lousy dean!
yes! take that, bitterman!
something i should have done a long time ago...
no, ma'am.
nerd!
marge, try to understand. there are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. as a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time. hey pal, did you get a load of the nerd?
boy, i can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt.
you see that, sir. drops his notes.
then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. besides, it isn't costing us - i swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site.
uh, excuse me "professor brainiac," but i worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, i think i know how a proton accelerator works.
all right, i will. in there, guys.
hello, dean? you're a stupid head.
look, i'm supposed to get a physics tutor...
heh heh. "nee."
you take that back...
oh, not souter... oh, no.
i'll write it on my hand...
c'mon guys, look at yourselves. all you do is study. i'm gonna show you the true meaning of college! we're gonna go out and par-ty!
but marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good...
and then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge. what?
of course he does. he's a cute little piggy. curly, straight, curly, straight, curly... ow! why you little...
hey, that's not the wallet inspector.
look, i'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. right, marge?
i got it! we're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
and all those other pranks were my idea too. i'm the one who should be expelled.
yes, you have.
no problem, guys. the important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends.
actually, i've been working on a plan. during the exam, i'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out.
whatever. either way is good...
i'm gonna lose my job just 'cause i'm dangerously unqualified.
computers can do that?
oh, let's just say i had help from a "little magic box..."
look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. these guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college.
oh. then i learned the real value of college is to study and work hard.
hmmm, true.
yes.
oh no! burns' birthday!
every time mr. burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. and i always get some terrible job.
ow. ow. ow. missed me. ow!
well, i also do a delightful impression of him. i paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants.
lisa, don't spoil our fun!
okay, stupid!
marge, the comedy roast is an american tradition. it's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. hey flanders, you smell like manure!
i said are you ready to laugh?!
you know, mr. burns is so cheap...
i mean... you know... mr. burns... is so... old...
oooh, tough crowd. better bring out the big guns. here's an impression of mr. burns that you might find... a little cheeky. i'm mr. burns. blah, blah, blah. do this. do that. blah, blah, blah. i think i'm so big. blah, blah, blah.
don't worry, boy. he'll be ready for your aunt selma's birthday.
maggie, i'm trying to watch tv. put that moldy old bear down. moldy!?! old!?!... i'm gonna get something to eat!
well, burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, i'll tell you that. he's going to have to give me... my own recording studio. two all-beef patties, special sauce lettuce cheese pickles onions on a sesame seed bun...
yes. we'll send the eye.
sorry, burns. no deal.
a million dollars and three hawaiian islands. good ones, not the leper ones.
woo hoo! i'm rich! rich i tells ya. here you go. it seems to be stuck. bad baby! bad maggie!
ah, big deal. who needs his money? we're gettin' by okay.
i think i'm blind.
right here.
my life can't get any worse.
after lunch can i whip you?
aw thanks, marge. but it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured soul. box...
i can see why this is so popular.
that's right.
oh, barney, leave me alone.
but mr. burns, it's not my bear. it's maggie's.
well, we didn't get any money, but mr. burns got what he wanted. marge, i'm confused. is this a happy ending or a sad ending?
oooh, pure genius... oh. pure genius. and now to make the leap from dreams to reality.
flanders! you're the devil?
hey, wait. if i don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?
i'm smarter than the de-vil! i'm smarter than the dev-
not likely. heh, heh.
no.
more. mmmm.
no.
woo hoo! ow!
but i'm so sweet and tasty. well, time to go to work.
they're dogs! and they're playing poker!
heh-heh-heh. lisa, vampires are make-believe. just like elves, gremlins and eskimos.
hmmm... business deal.
sure did.
it was the boy! huh, ooooh, punch!
correction. free blood. ahhh.
oh, lisa, you and your stories. bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and tv... is.
bart! how many times have i told you not to bite your sist... wait a minute! you are a vampire.
super fun happy slide!
i guess killing will be fun enough.
take that, vile fiend!
oh, sorry.
stupid tv. be more funny.
heh, heh, some idiot actually called in!
marge, it's public tv! they never have anything good. where are the geraldos? where are the eubankses-es?
the ballet? woo hoo!
all right, but remember it's mine. that's what ballet is?
yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum. heh, heh, heh. it was worth it.
i can't. i gotta take my wife to the ballet.
mmmm... invisible cola. heh, heh. time to stick it to the man.
must... get to ballet... promised marge...
they'll grow back, right?
your point being?
lumber has a million uses.
marge, i got sprayed by this skunk! oh look, it's doing it again! marge, you can't go out on saturday. that's our special night.
what the... oh, i don't know... a little show called "doctor quinn, medicine woman"?!
when will you be home?
where you going?
how can you do this, marge? how can you desert your children?
man's best friend, indeed.
that's it! i'm calling my buddies. marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
oh lisa, haven't you seen "home alone?" if some burglars come, it'll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.
here you g... nnnnnno.
we pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two popsicles out of the freezer.
two.
done.
my wife's having a girls' night out.
a lot of blue hair? heh-heh. what a freak. it's marge! she's become a crazed criminal, just because i didn't take her to the ballet.
really?
that's them!
look, marge, i'm sorry i haven't been a better husband. i'm sorry about the time i tried to make gravy in the bathtub. i'm sorry i used your wedding dress to wax the car... and i'm sorry... oh well let's just say i'm sorry for the whole marriage up to this point.
but please marge, don't drive into that chasm!
solid waste, i could kiss you. mmmmm... ewwww.... mmmmm...ohhh... mmmmm... ahhhh. ooh, i think this was pizza.
woo hoo!
oh my god!
tram...ample...een! tram...baple...een!
krusty!
yeah. what's the deal?
hi, son. hi, son. hi, son.
marge, it's the perfect exercise. it'll double the value of our house. and it was free. freeee!!
absolutely! and this is just the beginning! i've got some big plans.
no it doesn't!
okay, okay. i'll take care of it.
all right, all right! i'll get rid of the trampoline!
uh-huh.
okay, the trampoline was a bad idea. but you know what? at least i'm out there trying new things. if it were up to you, all we'd ever do is work and go to church!
that's not fun!
see, marge?
marge, can i go outside and play?
and that sends me into a shame spiral.
and i feel that you hear my shame.
i feel validated by that.
me too. wow! for free, "surplus drums of mayonnaise from operation desert storm."
oh marge, you and i are fine now. who needs brad goodman?
it sure does!
thank you. very, very much.
this is great. i can finally look like i want and not get hassled by the man.
hey, i hear ya, buddy.
no, we're not.
that's what i've been saying. we're all fine the way we are. oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time.
ah, mcgarnigal. eases the pain.
it means he gets results, you stupid chief.
steak?
steak?
ah! the last peanut - overflowing with the oil and salt of its departed brothers. uh oh. something's wrong. ow, pointy. eww, slimy. uh-oh, moving. ah-ha! oh, twenty dollars. i wanted a peanut. explain how. woo hoo!
mmmmm... free goo.
well if it isn't the leader of the wiener patrol, boning up on his nerd lessons.
you're right, marge. good work, boy. egghead likes his bookie wook!
just tucking him in.
dah, i am the captain. my son is bart.
bart, i'd be delighted to go on your trip with you!
i'll take it.
please not flanders. please not flanders. please not flanders.
uh, i dunno. but lucky for you somebody here is responsible. hey, there's a new mexico.
wrong again, flanders. in a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land.
now i have to face stupid reality again!... flanders! my socks feel dirty! gimme some water to wash 'em!
oh pardon me, mr. let's ration everything, but what do you think we're floatin' on? don't you know the poem? "water, water everywhere/ so let's all have a drink."
ohh... what does it matter? we're doomed!
well, since you're all such a bunch of big ration-babies, i'll just be in charge of the rationing. observe, boy. the secret is to take tiny bites, like so:
why couldn't i be on one of the smart rafts. i bet they're having the time of their life.
this ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, flanders. this is the real thing... all right, well that's okay. when they come to rescue him, they'll rescue us.
flanders! snap out of it!
you'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.
he'll be back. here fishy, fishy, fishy. we're waiting. son, there's something i was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, i want you to have it now.
i stole it from that borgnine guy.
thanks boy. now be careful when you...
according to this map there's a krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
never mind the fog! that way. steer! there isn't much time!
give seven hundred krustyburgers!
go away. eating.
hi.
gotta go. what the hell was that? i probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy i found in the parking lot.
you too. no goose bumps. no hallucinations. that last time was just a fluke.
yeah. that mindy seems real nice.
see, i got this friend named... joey joe joe junior... schabadoo.
oh, what the hell, it's me. i'm attracted to another woman. what am i going to do?
barney. that is so insightful. how did you come up with that?
hey, my favorite, raspberry swirl with a double glaze.
me too.
foul temptress! i'll bet she thinks ziggy's gotten too preachy, too. i made it the whole day without seeing her again.
that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator. that's unsexy. ew.
well, this is my floor. arr - see ya tomorrow.
hi, son. howya... ewww.
yeah, good.
let's have a little quality time together, just you and me.
hey! we haven't watched tv in awhile.
sir isa-who?
col. klink! did you ever get my letters?
hee, hee, hee, hee. did you know hogan had tunnels all over your camp?
i, as well. are you happy, jeeves?
marge lives here?
um, because i have a small role in a broadway musical. it's not much, but it's a start.
like what?
lisa, look out behind you!
sucker.
mindy! oh no! i'm sweating like roger ebert. uh, murphy, you are elf a controllably i think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo.
oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. colonel klink, why have you forsaken me?
heh heh heh. did you know kinch had a radio in the coffee pot?
mindy?
yeah. uh, walls are a necessity in today's society. heh heh.
oh, mindy, we have to fight our temptation.
oh!
go to hell! heh, you know, i was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but i think as long as we're not alone together...
huh?
is there any way to get out of this?
oh yeah.
yeah, yeah.
oh yeah. like you don't know. we're gonna have sex.
yes we do. the cookie told me so.
but they're so sweet.
mmmm... marge.
lisa, just because you're ten feet tall doesn't mean you can tell me what to do.
and you know what the best part is? we've really done something for the children.
shhh. i'm trying to teach the baby to gamble.
uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. dealer busts. looks like you all win again.
why thanks, senator! oop, looks like my shift is over.
hey, marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, i bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino.
strike three, marge. i remember that meeting, and i have a photographic memory.
no! please, please, please, please, please...
no!
marge, you waited for me.
marge, i'm taking the car.
marge...
wait. i see what's happening here. you're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. well, that's just sad.
you've gotta improvise, lisa. cloves, tom collins mix, frozen pie crust.
ah, come on, lisa, there's no reason to... let's go see mom.
huh? wuh? lisa? what's up?
aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it.
boogeyman?! you nail the windows shut! i'll get the gun! bart, i don't want to alarm you, but there may be a boogeyman or boogeymen in the house!
oh, nothing, marge. just a little incident involving the boogeyman. of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid.
lisa, your mom still loves you. it's just that she has a career, now. she's a slot jockey.
it's always something isn't it? first, i have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this. ow...ow...ow...ow. ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
oh yeah, the costume. hello, floreeda.
no, lisa. the only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. i call him gamblor. and it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws.
you promised lisa to help her with her costume. you made her cry, then i cried. then maggie laughed. she's such a little trooper.
marge, i want you to admit you have a gambling problem.
no no, that's too expensive. just don't do it anymore.
oh sure... remember when i got caught stealing all those watches from sears?
oh yeah. i forgot already.
woo hoo!
eh, that's no big loss.
oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em.
curse you, magic beans.
hello, police? are you sitting down? good. i wish to report a robbery!
marge, they're only human.
oh lisa, stop pining for your saxophone. i got you another instrument.
you know lisa, music helps daddy think.
i dunno. can you swing a sack of door knobs?
i'm someone else!
we don't need a thinker, we need a doer. someone who'll act without considering the consequences.
aw, dad, you've done a lot of great things, but you're a very old man now, and old people are useless. aren't they? aren't they? huh? yes they are. yes they are...
marge, we're responsible adults and...
... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
no, we're forming a vigilante group.
woo hoo! woo hoo hoo hoo! woo hoo, hoo! take that maynard g. krebs!
sorry. okay, men, it's time to clean up this town.
you know, push people around, make ourselves feel big. bart, give me that megaphone of yours.
never mind the commercials. just give it to me. i've got to whip this neighborhood into shape. move along there.
get him!
too late. you better have a good reason for doing that, boy.
you're in. here's the sack.
i 'unno. coast guard?
oh, that might be a typo.
aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, kent. forty percent of all people know that.
oh, kent, i'd be lying if i said my men weren't committing crimes.
y'ello.
why you monster! and you have my daughter's saxophone too!
oh sorry. i'm a little nervous.
listen, mr. cat burglar, i vow to go without sleep and guard the springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time. we'll be right back.
dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. just stand around and don't steal anything. hey!
it's his job.
he's a burglar. well, mr. cat burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? there's just one little problem. thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named homer j. sim -- oh my god! underage kids drinking beer without a permit!
well, no matter what the paper says, i still have a job to do.
nooooo!
aw, dad, i could kiss you.
so, mr. molloy. it seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him.
actually, it wasn't me. it was my dad, grampa.
shut up.
well, i guess i'll be going to my home now and... sleep.
it's mine! "frightfully sorry, but there is no hidden treasure. i have already used this time to escape from your jail. fondest wishes." oh, i can't make out this signature.
we'll dig our way out!
yeah, you kids gotta go to school. i gotta go to work. the only one who has it easy is marge.
that's not a job. it's a waste of time. what can poor people pay ya? nothin'! what satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? none! who wants to help poor people anyway? nobody!
why not? i remember my first after-school job. i was in a band.
yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man.
gig, son. when you're a musician, a job is called a gig.
yep, well, that's what got me where i am today.
ah. oliver north. he was just poured into that uniform.
oh, something stupid like bart would say. bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. something like that.
aw, don't worry, son, they said the same thing about urkel... that little snot. boy i'd like to smack that kid. what the hell are you readin' books for?
how do you figure boy?
all right, but after leno i'm all laughed out you know.
what kind of catchphrase is that?
woo hoo! cheap meat! oooh, this one's open!
woo hoo!
ooh. rancid meat attack. stupid parasites. is there no way i can find justice?
bor-ing.
shhhh, lisa. the dog is barking.
oh, that i'll wear.
bee? aah!
one hot dog please.
it's true, it's true. we're so lame.
you're selling what now?
you can't sell that. karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
what? that's your job. if he starts doing lisa's wood chopping...
okay, okay i'll let him. but then i get a chipwich, okay?
outrageous.
uh, i like to keep a lollipop there.
that's even worse than the album grampa released.
well you deserve it. all these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart. ub. apu friend me good.
that kwik-e-mart's a real... .
everything really wrapped up nicely. much quicker than usual.
and we've all found happiness... every one of us. hey, what's that sound?
hey, he's not happy at all. he lied to us through song. i hate when people do that.
okay.
i'm aware of that.
are we in india yet?
are we in india yet?
this isn't very convenient.
are you really the head of the kwik-e-mart?
really?
you?
fine. oh, i mean not good.
apu, if it'll make you feel any better, i've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish flanders was dead.
hey, let's all hug apu.
hey, there's still time. let's hug him again.
dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them.
ah, come on, marge, you're way too...
one, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock. five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock!.. rock! rock! rock! rock-a, rock, rock! rockarockrock! we're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock to-nighhhttt!
thank you, thank you very much!
yes. but there's more. dad, i love you, but: you are a weird, sore-headed old crank and nobody likes ya.
and we can't watch fox 'cause they own those chemical weapons plants in syria.
i'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. everyone listens to me! no matter how dumb my suggestions are.
i'unno.
hey.
hello. well, today's the day for homer j. i know i'm gonna win this time.
union rule twenty-six - "every employee must win worker of the week at least once, regardless of gross incompetence, obesity, or rank odor."
nobody respects me at work.
boring. no, the batteries!
make it stop!
i can't! i can't!
hello, is this nasa?
shut up. and another thing - how come i can't get no tang 'round here? and also... hold on a second.
no. it wasn't me, i swear. it was... him.
respect?! nooo! it was me! i made the crank call. i do it all the time. check with the fbi, i have a file. i have a fiiiiile.
i'll field this one. the only danger is if they send us to that terrible planet of the apes. ...wait a minute, statue of liberty... that was our planet. you maniacs! you blew it up! damn you! damn you all to hell.
less shame?
who's doin' what now?
aw, that's nothin'. watch this. there once was a man from nantucket i can't stands no more. mmmmm. mediciney.
ahem... i uh... don't think this contest is over yet, buzz. if that is your real name. i believe there is still a little something called the swimsuit competition.
congratulations, barney.
default? woo hoo! the two sweetest words in the english language. de-fault! de-fault! de-
oh.
are we there yet? i'm thirsty.
and that is that. no!
wait a minute race! wait a minute. wait!...ah-ha! now i'll bust that pretty face of yours. stupid bar.
i'll bash you good.
stupid rod. i got gypped.
woo hoo! sold!
what do you mean? it says right here: "free wig with every purchase of large wig. downtown wig center." why you little... hmmm... free wig. i love you, homey. heh, heh, heh. i don't need her at all anymore.
in theory, yes. jerk.
get tickets. must get tickets. find phone. yes! oh stupid sheep.
i've got two tickets to paradise / i've got two tickets to paradise... excellent guitar riff.
heh, heh, heh. yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. but they didn't have the guts.
why do you mock me, oh lord?
i know i shouldn't eat thee but... mmmm... sacri-licious.
y- no. flanders, i decided i'd like to go to the game with you.
well, yeah.
hi.
yeah. hey everybody, here comes fun! heh heh. ow.
ooh, you brought me a nacho hat. thanks, ned. nacho, nacho man / i want to be a nacho man. if anyone can pull it off, it's stan "the boy" taylor.
we won! we won! flanders, we won!
losers! losers! kiss my big springfield behind, shelbyville! i am invincible! invincible! ow!
you know stan taylor?
wow, thanks. now i have four children. you will be called "stitch-face." wow, flanders, this is about the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
no! i want everyone to know that this is ned flanders... my friend!
marge, quit livin' in the past.
i'll be there. and this time you can be the nacho man.
boring. let's watch something else.
yeah. hey what gives? i thought you had a satellite dish.
aw, uncle homer. ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, i want you to get to know my family.
can't talk... see flanders... later sex.
oh, yeah. a judge made me do that once, too. stupid lack of public urinals. hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, i'm comin' with ya.
but... all right. c'mon! we've been here for fifteen minutes. can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
ah, for some reason, moe's is always closed on wednesdays.
come on, come on, just give 'em the slop and lets get out of here. oh, i can do it faster that that.
love, marge. don't hate. love.
yes way.
ha, ha. you know something, he did say 'well' a lot.
they're fine.
okay. but at least let me take the boat out for one last spin!
too late.
humph, your car. boy, what are the odds, huh?
hey, what's up for today, neddie?
o-okay.
hmmm. guess he didn't see me.
hey flanders, over here. i got us some kick-ass seats.
i live to give.
get lost, flanders.
see, i told ya. there's nothin' to worry about. this place isn't...
hi, mom.
son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. it's how drunk you get.
i call the basement.
all done.
are you mad, woman? you never know when an old calendar might come in handy. sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? and these tv guides... so many memories. "gomer upsets sergeant carter." ooooh, i'll never forget that episode!
shazam.
use only in a well ventilated area. shove it, buddy.
nothing.
okay.
y'ello?
heh, heh. stick it to the man. no, wait! we'll call you back! bart! with ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. we could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love.
lisa, go to your room.
wee!
heh, heh, it does look like al gore.
what's he yelling about?
maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move it wouldn't get so hungry.
oh, everything's cruel according to you. keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. pulling on his tail is cruel. yelling in his ears is cruel. everything is cruel. so excuse me if i'm cruel. now i've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth.
shut up.
hey, any more arboretums around here?
that bird! he's killing the elephant! stop him!
grooming him, eh?
i know. he's grooming me. mmm... elephant fresh.
oh. good luck. look at these bills. "chain for elephant," "shots for elephant"... "oversized decorative poncho".
well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
then that's what i'll do, smart guy.
for the ninth time, no! wait a minute, this gives me an idea.
marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money.
well, that was under our old price structure. under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me.
sorry, bart. i'm gonna have to sell him.
what do you mean? it's an elephant, isn't it?
i only have two questions. how much, and give it to me.
so, your bid is zero.
thank you.
thank you.
don't worry, son. i'll get you a new elephant.
done.
here's the keys.
i'll just keep these then.
son, you're okay! and you've led us to the precious ivory. and of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to...
forget it. that elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
i'd like it fine.
yes, of course i would. who wouldn't like that? to be part of the music scene...
nah, that's okay. i'm pretty sure i can struggle my way out. first i'll just reach in and pull my legs out. now i'll pull my arms out with my face...
i'm alive! i'm alive. and i owe it all to this feisty feline.
oh, i guess it wouldn't be right to sell stampy after he saved my life. and, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
on the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products. all right. we'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
woo hoo! what do i get?
woo hoo! hey, this isn't such a great prize. oh, well, this may be a dirty job, but the big guys at the top work even harder.
that's it, boy. you're our last hope.
okay, boy, i wrote down exactly what to say. just read it and you're a shoo-in.
it's kurns, stupid!
disregard.
the boot kicked bart. it kicked him right in the butt.
there sure is. kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. the lesson is, never try. right in the butt. that was great.
huh? oh, right. so i guess you're in okay shape, huh? no heart problems or anything...
boo!
yeah, let's push him down the steps.
how come bart gets to do that and i can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside chef boyardee's house?
that was the end piece. that's it! being abusive to your family is one thing but i will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. go to your room!
bart, you listen.
my secret shame.
bart, you're coming home.
you idiot! he was the most talented one!
can i keep him anyway? huh, huh?
hey, the trail of donuts ended. bart!
i'll miss you, son.
right back atcha, son. aw. and now i want you to meet your new brother, hans moleman.
give it a try. it's like kissing a peanut. heh, heh, heh.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. they let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?
well, i'm off to work.
yes, deeply concerned.
that is true.
i can't let the boy see me skipping work.
how do you do, sir? sucker.
all right.
what does sequestered mean?
what does deadlocked mean?
uh-huh. and "if"?
where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free hbo - oooh, "free willy!"
uh, how are the rest of you voting? i'm only doing what i think is right. i believe freddie quimby should walk out of here a free hotel.
shut up.
i don't like this new director's cut.
souvenir.
great, marge. i wanna hear all about it.
what? it's not magaggie's birthday? oh.
ooh.
hee, hee, hee, hee. that is funny.
marge, please. old people don't need companionship. they need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
oh.
not at all.
if he marries your mother, marge, we'll be brother and sister! and then our kids, they'll be horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!
dad, that will never work. if you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool. now, what you gotta do / if you want to get a kiss / is act real smooth / and make your move like this.
now what's that rule?
all right!
yabba-dabba-doo!
that's right, money. your money's happiness is all that moneys.
what?!
woo hoo! three hundred fifty dollars!! now i can buy seventy transcripts of "nightline"!
ew yuuuuck!
whew. don't try to eat these so-called "chips."
huh? oh. okay. i'll take three. i mean, woo hoo!
i was bluffing.
you think i don't want to? it's those tv networks, marge. they won't let me. one quality show after another. each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. if they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. but they won't, they won't let me live!
take another bath in malt liquor?
oh, and how is "education" supposed to make me feel smarter? besides, every time i learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. remember when i took that home wine making course and i forgot how to drive?
and how.
well... i can tell the difference between butter and "i can't believe it's not butter."
i've failed again. everybody can teach a class but me. i'm an idiot. what am i gonna tell my wife and kids?
that depends. is there another way to get this job?
i'll do it! anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging and noise... of a family of love. sha la la la.
yes, lisa. daddy's a teacher.
can't talk now, flanders. i've got a class to teach.
nothing for me, today! i've got a class to teach!
it's all right! i'm a teacher.
yeah, yeah. that'll eat up some time. uh, how 'bout you, otto.
huh? yeah, i was listening. very funny.
uh, yes, yes. to the untrained eye i'm eating an orange. but to the eye that has brains, i am making a point about marriage. for you see, marriage is a lot like an orange. first you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards.
i told marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
i was telling marge that we could save some money if she only dyed her hair once a month.
oh yeah. she's been gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
marge, i didn't tell 'em personal stuff.
oh, you mean about you. all right, maybe i said some things -- some personal things. but, you should have seen 'em, marge. they really wanted to hear what i had to say.
yes ma'am.
this is a place of learning, not a house of... hearing about things.
no, wait! uh, uh, wait!... i, yes! i do have a story about two other young marrieds.
now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. it seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.
not tonight, marge. tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home.
marge, you'll never guess what. my whole class is here. they're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives.
so, little lisa, apple of my eye. how are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?
and how's my little major leaguer? catch any junebugs today?
why you little...
well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed...
all right, we're breaking early tonight, class. for tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in lisa's diary.
huh?
but, i learned my lesson. it'll never happen again.
aw, marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing. honey, the door blew shut! oh. fine. that's what you want? you got it. this scene is gettin' old, man. i'm hittin' the road. maybe i'll drop you a line someday from wherever i wind up in this crazy old world.
don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies.
keep up the rough-housing, son. without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. oh, these stubborn grass stains.
good news, lisa. i don't need your mother anymore. i've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way.
lisa, you will respect your new mother. now give her a kiss. kisss herrr. ohmygodohmygodohmygod. all right, let's get our stories straight. she tripped, right?
ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. oh, i miss marge. lisa you're smart. help me trick her into taking me back.
i'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
all right, brain. it's all up to you. if you don't think of what it is, we'll lose marge forever.
moe, what are you doing here?
bye, moe!
marge, i figured out what i can give you that no one else can. a bouquet of po... i give up. i don't deserve to live with you. my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
are you kidding? it's a wondrous, marvelous thing. marge, i need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you. i need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all, i need you to love me, because i love you.
marge, look at me! we've been separated for a day, and i'm as dirty as a frenchman. in another few hours, i'll be dead. i can't afford to lose your trust again.
hey, this is dated two weeks ago.
special present?! i don't wanna wait! i want it now! i want the children to see. oh. right. later.
it's cool in here, boy. for the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator.
i got the idea when i noticed the refrigerator was cold.
marge, can you set the oven to cold?
yes, lisa?
ooh, the tinkler. i like the sound of that. we'll take it.
woo hoo!
don't worry boy, when you get a job like me, you'll miss every summer.
ah...there's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool.
mmmm....
but why? she's such a fox. i mean, what's on fox tonight? something ribald, no doubt.
not everything. there's still the little matter of the whereabouts of your wife.
oh, i see. then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. really, i mean that. sorry if it sounded sarcastic.
hard to the left!
cat!... deer!... old man!
we hit the jackpot, here! white gold! texas tea... sweetener.
read your town charter, boy. "if food stuffs should touch the ground, said food stuffs shall be turned over to the village idiot." since i don't see him around, start shoveling.
those are prizes. ooo, a blasting cap!
woo hoo! a four day weekend!
in america, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women.
huh, wha?
all right, pal. where'd you get the sugar for that tea?
never! never, marge! i can't live the buttoned-down life like you. i want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. sure i might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. oh, i'll never be the darling of the so called "city fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this homer simpson.
no! hey! get off my sugar! bad bees! bad! ow! ow! oh, they're defending themselves somehow!
bees are on the what, now?
nooooooo! my sugar is melting! melting! oh what a world!
it's okay, marge. i've learned my lesson. a mountain of sugar is too much for one man. it's clear now why god portions it out in those tiny packets and why he lives on a plantation in hawaii.
huh? wuzz wrong? house run away? dog's on fire?
marge, it's three a.m. and i worked all day!
hmmm.
hm... mmmm, chocolate... / mmmm, invisible cola. / mmmm, forbidden donut. / mmmm sacrilicious. mmmm, / mmmm, free goo. mmmm, something.
oh, okay.
ooh, that was a close one, kids. okay, marge. as long as we're traumatizing the kids, i have a scandalous story of my own.
gotta go.
that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator. that's unsexy. ew. well, this is my floor. see you tomorrow.... i tried to avoid her, but we were sent to a nuclear convention in capital city together...
stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it.
oh, mindy, we have to fight our temptation.
go to hell! i was doing my best to resist her... but at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom.
yeah, yeah.
oh yeah. like you don't know. we're gonna have sex.
yes we do. the cookie told me so.
oh, baby.
she hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
wait a minute, marge. love isn't hopeless. look, maybe i'm no expert on the subject. but there was one time i got it right...
marge?
who? oh.
marge, pour vous.
i've got a problem. once you stop this car, i'm gonna hug you and kiss you and then i'll never be able to let you go.
but not the last.
tv town! hammock land!
embarrassed? what are you talking about?
oh yes.
lobster hat... fishnet speedo, jr... wheelie shoes... invisible dog leash. well, i'm packed.
no.
the whole trunk's full of 'em, marge.
no.
we don't need to do that, marge. i'm not tired. i'm not tired at all.
what's that?
well, okay. if it's fun. let's see... i'll take eleven hundred dollars worth.
eyeball stew.
oh look! it's the twelve noon robot parade! hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
i kicked one of those stupid itchy characters in the butt.
but marge, i was a political prisoner.
i kicked a giant mouse in the butt. do i have to draw you a diagram?
hey look, this one's coming on to me. yoo hoo, mr. robot...
back you robots! nobody ruins my family vacation but me. and maybe the boy.
what're you, the narrator?
die, bad robots, die! with a dry, cool wit like that i could be an action hero.
but there are five of us.
nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. now, i'm not very political -- i usually think people who vote are a bit "fruit-y" -- but, for some reason, this birch barlow really speaks to me...
when i'm driving the car, i get to choose the radio station. when you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station. i can't take this anymore. let's switch back.
yes, ma'am. sideshow bob. yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box.
phew.
oh, sideshow bob.
i know what you're up to, mayor terwigajer. and no one in my family's gonna stand for it!
stuck-up riverdale punks. think they're too good for me.
hey, mr. smithers!
i'll kill you! i'll kill all of you!
sorry, sorry. don't worry, there's plenty i can do to keep myself occupied. maybe i'll check out that axe collection. see ya later.
moe! give me a beer!
why should i kill my family?
so, what do you think, marge? all i need is a title. i was thinking along the lines of "no tv and no beer make homer..." something something.
gimme the bat, marge. gimme the bat! gimme the bat! c'mon, gimme the bat. gimme the bat ba-bat! heh-heh. scaredy-cat...
can't murder now. eating.
noooo!
television! teacher, mother, secret lover. urge to kill fading, fading... fading... rising! ...fading, fading, gone. come, family, sit in the snow with daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow.
can't. frozen.
urge to kill rising.
get it off! get it off! get it offf!!
what the hell are you smiling at?
nooooo! oh no! they're gaining on me. wait, i have an idea. these wieners will give me the quick energy i need to escape.
hmm. fabulous house. well-behaved kids. sisters-in-law dead. luxury sedan. woo hoo! i hit the jackpot. marge, dear. would you kindly pass me a donut?
what's my name?! what color is the sky?! what of donuts? what?! for the love of god, tell meeeee!!!
uh oh, it's seeping in! stupid cheap weather stripping.
no, it's not that. didn't you hear? they have no bananas. they have no bananas today.
new glasses?
probably misses his old glasses.
it was, marge. admit it.
oh good, here comes the collection plate.
we can spare it, marge. we've been blessed.
stop him! he's headed for the window!
tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?
ooo, how convenient.
see, son? telling the truth isn't so bad.
to the little girl's room!
whew, that's all of 'em. and i'm so proud you didn't try to forge my name. how 'bout a present, son?
done and done.
ah, the mysteries of life.
sports, sports, sports, sports. sports, sports, sports, sports. marge, bart rides up in the front seat today because he's a good guy at sports.
well boy, you won. so i'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. here's your turtle, alive and well.
i don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. no jokes, no taunting... look! that kid's got bosoms! who's got a wet towel? come here, you butterball.
we're laughing with her, marge! there's a big difference.
okay, little buddy, hop in!
ah, sorry bart, lisa and i are going out for gelato. we'd ask you to come but, you know...
wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. to think of all the time i wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... i love you.
quiet down, bart!
okay. all right, pie, i'm just gonna do this. and if you get eaten, it's your own fault.
i asked for ketchup. i'm eating salad here.
moe, what are you doin' here?
now that we're all alone, marge, admit it. you like lisa best.
oh, so you're a bart woman, are you?
hi kids!
you like sweets, kids? i know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. in this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. you'd spit them out! you would! i'm talking about the candy industry trade show. .
they hid them in every millionth krusty klump bar and krusty klump bar with almonds.
sorry kids, but this is one event i want my darling wife by my side.
they wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
hurry, marge. if we get there early we can get our pictures taken with the two surviving musketeers.
i feel like a kid in some kind of a store. brilliant... exquisite ...ooh, you'll do well... gimme those, etc.
i don't know.
oooh -- gummy bears. gummy calves heads. gummy jaw breakers. what dat?
must have rare gummy. distract the salesman marge!
now, this is going to take all my skill.
run, marge! save the booty! see you in hell, candy boys.
relax, marge, there's plenty for her to do in there. see, she's having the time of her life.
nobody's blaming you. hey, could you take the wheel for a second? i have to scratch myself in two places at once.
precious venus...
for a minute there i thought i was in big trouble. it's just a...
oh that. no. i was just grabbing a gummy venus de milo that got stuck to your pants.
c'mon, i'm a decent guy...
well lisa, remember that post card grampa sent us from florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?
that's right, we all thought it was hilarious. but it turns out we were wrong. that alligator was sexually harassing that woman.
thanks, kids.
it's okay, they're with me.
uh-huh?
you mean, i'm on my own? i've never been on my own. oh no! on own! on own! i need help. oh, god help me! help me, god! y'ello?
okay. say, can you introduce me to the sasquatch? i like his style.
not with that attitude.
it didn't blow over, marge. nothin' ever blows over for me.
whaa?
i don't have a friend in the world.
oh, marge. it's a miracle.
maybe tv is right. tv's always right. are you hugging the tv?
i like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. i know - "evening at the improv." they never talk about anything beyond the 1980s.
but those shows all look so crummy.
hello. i am homer simpson, or as some of you wags have dubbed me, "father goose." you know, everybody believed the worst about me right away. nobody cares that i didn't do it. but i didn't. okay, look, i've done some bad things in my life, but harassing women is not one of them. like, one time they were having this race with this stupid old-timey bicycles with the big wheel in front. so i figured, "we'll see about that." so i get this big chunk of cinderblock and i... oh, gotta go. innocent!
precious venus... thank you!
you're both right.
oh, that man is sick!
but listen to the music. he's evil!
marge, my friend, i haven't learned a thing. let's never fight again.
no. it's just that i've only seen this movie twice before, and i've seen you every night for the last eleven ye-- what i meant to say is... we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie. i promise. enchiladas.
ooooookay.
oh. all right.
yes. and i am pursuing my interest in...
oooh. "mr. and mrs. erotic american."
ooh, the pharaoh's chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus.
oh, here we are. the "utility room."
no, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. i imagine i'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room.
never mind. you wouldn't understand.
no.
no.
marge, i'll explain to you afterwards.
you want me to spend more time with dad? what about my new year's resolution?
great. i'm gonna be stuck in the car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
that is correct.
they didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
ewww, why're we stopping at this dump? wow. let's go find that hot dog tree i planted.
you're the screw-up!
all right! that's it. we're goin' home. i'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
out.
of course not marge, just for the rest of his life. he said i was an accident. he didn't want to have me!
but when i do it, it's cute.
dad!
you're no girl, you're a boy. a good boy. you can be president. scratch that. you will be president.
i think lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
b-but i'm using my whole ass.
some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! but now, i've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.
you know what?
we're both screw-ups.
aw, dad.
i'm with you, dad.
this is gonna to be great.
ah, come on, everybody. this bar is like a tavern to me.
jokes on them. i'm still alive.
can't.
i'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
yes. cris-a-tunity. you're right! i've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. that's it. i'm going to find a new bar to drink in. and i'm gonna get drunker than i've been in my entire life! bart, where's my wallet?
okay.
gr-aargh! oh my god, this man is my exact double. that dog has a puffy tail! here, puff! here puff! the last bar in springfield. if they don't let me in here, i'm gonna have to quit drinking. shut up, liver. ooh, my liver hurts.
uh, but i am a pilot.
i stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
yeah, that's exactly why i'm here.
uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, i'm gonna let you do most of the work. i think you're ready for it, alan. and um, ah, i'll just uh get us started...
woo hoo!
but marge, you deserve a vacation. it's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state.
take it easy, marge. how 'bout if we dope you up real good?
permit me to solve the mystery. your mother has a fear of flying.
not everybody.
where? where?
you heard your mother's ramblings. she's fine, so behave.
and i don't believe in it. it breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. you don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
it's raining men!
she's fine. oh.
good, you do that.
you'll be picking many a bean.
bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.
keep sliding.
oh, no, i'm not here to take a reading test. i wanna see some credentials.
tell me the truth! don't tell her i raised my voice. don't. happy family, happy family.
oh, being stuck on this god forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite i have.
why, you clattering clank of.... my dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. d'oh the pain! d'oh the pain of it all!
what should we do until you get back?
aw, it didn't work.
like what?
shut up.
well, something did.
oh, okay. have it your own way, marge. i'll be back in a minute. i'm going outside. to stalk... ... lenny and carl.
stonecutters, eh? how do i join?
next.
you'd better run, egg!
then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
it is. it's been happening to me all my life.
what do they do? what don't they do! oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! my stars.
do i ever! it's five years later and i still think i'm a chicken. i'm a chicken, marge.
huh?
what?
this is it. my ticket in. they have to let me join if i'm the son of a member. i'll take this communist one too.
number one? ha ha. what kind of stupid wiener name is that? "hello, my name is number one." and so forth.
you outrank mr. burns here?
is he the leader?
okay, okay, i didn't ask for your life story.
hey, have you ever noticed that the "crossing the desert" is a lot like "the unblinking eye" and it's exactly like "the wreck of the hesperus"?
and by the sacred parchment i swear that if i reveal the secrets of the stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
oh really?
really?
yep, but they gave me these rollerblades so i can glide to the front door. heh heh heh heh. sweet. jealous?
you're jealous.
what's this?
that's because you trust your stupid school books. here's what really happened at the signing of the declaration of independence...
oh, yeah. beer busts, beer blasts, keggers, stein hoists, aa meetings, beer night. it's wonderful, marge. i've never felt so accepted in all my life. these people looked deep within my soul, and assigned me a number based on the order in which i joined.
who rigs every oscar night? /
uh-oh. i need a bib. if i slop any on my shirt, i could lose the respect of my beloved brethren.
huh? oh. yeah. thanks, lenny.
oh. sorry.
oh that. it's just a birth mark and i'll thank you not to stare.
woo-hoo!
so?
remove the girl.
woo hoo!
woo hoo! i'm out.
oh i win again, don't i? woo hoo.
from now on, i want you to be honest with me. i mean, i'm not perfect, right?
lisa, you were right. my happiness is fading.
what do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated.
hm... i could help others. i'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the civil war .
hey, fellas. can i join?
oh marge, kids, i miss my club.
you know, marge you're right. the simpson family is the best possible club i could belong to.
go knightboat, go!
but marge, knightboat. the crime solving boat.
it was bart.
so many memories. aw, look... knightboat.
moom. that's exciting.
listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any tv show. it was a tumultuous time for our nation. the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live. the information super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about "star trek," and the domestication of the dog continued unabated.
not on my shift.
okay.
woo hoo! this is it! with this single glorious check, i'm finally completely out of debt.
sorry, that just slipped out. i'll miss ya.
ooh, lovely desk. it would be too bad if someone, oh, i don't know... didn't use a coaster!! such a nice tidy office. maybe it's time you started living like a pig! oh, i hope i haven't upset you... bongo head!
that's for employing me for eight years! ha ha. and that is that. goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. hello dream job in paradise.
woo hoo!
don't worry, marge. i've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. there will be exactly enough money for you, me, bart and lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices.
that night your mother and i went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. we began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach... marge...
i've got sand in my underpants.
i love you, marge.
it's okay, marge. they pave the way for this kind of filth in school.
actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. at that time, i had no idea maggie even existed.
hi maggie. so anyhoo, back then there was no way for me to know your mother was pregnant.
no.
i'm gonna make it after all!
can't talk, praying. dear lord, the gods have been good to me and i am thankful. for the first time in my life, everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is.
thank you. thank you very much. it is nice work.
it's true, the bundle is little. but i'm not in it for the money.
man. it's windy as hell out there.
new job?... marge is pregnant?! nooooo!
oh just that one time.
you're pregnant?!
you're pregnant! we're gonna have to have a baby! all our financial plans are ruined. we're doomed! doomed i tells ya!
yeah.
anyhoo... we're doomed!
check.
my marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. i failed. quitting my dream job was the hardest thing i've ever done.
this was the happiest time of my life. i'll never forget you guys. especially you, joey.
don't worry, joey. we'll make it to california some day.
actually, i quit and i came to get my job back.
i can't go on with this charade any longer. i hate my job. i hate my life. and ever since i found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
it's just in one ear and out the other with you isn't it, marge.
it's wonderful! it's magical! oh boy, here it comes - another mouth.
marvelous.
hello. aw. it's a boy... and what a boy.
a girl! oh marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!
absolutely.
oh, there are pictures. i keep them where i need the most cheering up.
there's that word again.
well then, i have a back-up plan. see, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo...
i'm getting to that. so anyway, they're going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...
so anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...
it's at times like this i wish i were a religious man.
just a second. what's everyone so worked up about? so there's a comet. big deal. it'll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahua's head.
of course i'm right. if i'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow.
homer simpson takes care of his family.
no deal. out.
an hour! i can't wait another hour. what's keeping that stupid comet? there it is.
i can't get the... i can't get the door closed. somebody's going to have to get out.
uh, yeah. i can do that.
no, no! shut up! shut up! stop it, stop it! i can't take this anymore. i can't let that brave man out there die alone. i'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. especially his children. i'm goin' out there. and it was a baby ox.
i know kids, i'm scared too.
"this year give her english muffins." whatever you say, mr. billboard. best in the west. it rhymes. clown college? you can't eat that.
clowns are funny.
that's it! you people have stood in my way long enough. i'm going to clown college!
hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
you weren't complaining when i got you this close to chachi.
homer.
stop it! you're killing me! seattle...
steady, steady...
kill wealthy dowager.
got it! no shock for me .
that's the spirit. never give up.
i'm beat, and after work i've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the ace awards.
oh yeah. when i started this clown thing i thought it would be nothing but glory. you know, the glory of being a clown? i tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when i see the smiles on their little faces, i just know they're getting ready to jab me with something.
and now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old "starsky and hutches."
uh... no. i'm going a different way than you, dick.
look, you're gonna be having dinner with groucho tonight if you don't beat it.
i'm not krusty.
i am not krusty.
well if we agree, then why are we arguing?
i want a free car because i'm krusty. krusty the clown! get it? krus-ty!
hey, what are these holes?
oh yeah. speed holes.
what keeps doin' that?
uh... actually my name is barney. yeah. barney gumbel.
uh... actually my real name is uh... think, krusty, think... joe valachi.
krusty the clown.
hey! i'm doing it! i'm doing it! i'm the greatest clown in the world!
heh-heh, good one, krusty.
ta-da!
i'm a singing in the show... hot! yeow! cold! ow! hot! cold! hot! ow! who's! doing! that?!
psh, that's no reason to block the tv.
there it is. "aust-rali-a." i'll be damned...
oh, he'll agitate ya. ho, ho. he sure will. what can we do for you?
that's tough but fair. boy, go with the man.
sweet land of liberty... of thee i sing.
really? look, boy! now i'm in australia! now i'm in america! australia! america! austr--
--alia! america, australia, ameri-- ow!
hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers i've heard so much about.
punishment?!
booting?
what kind of a sick country would kick someone with a giant boot?!
you sold us out, conover! stay back or i'll boot your prime minister! i'll do it! so help me god i'll boot him! when will you australians learn? in america, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. the streets are safe. old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. and the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. so, like us, let your children run wild and free. because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. now boy, run back to the embassy! back to american soil!
maaarge!
show 'em what american butts are made of, son!
take a guess.
yeah, that's right barney. this year i invested in pumpkins. they've been going up the whole month of october, and i got a feeling they're gonna peak right around january. and bang, that's when i'll cash in.
marge, we had a deal. your sisters don't come here after six, and i stop eating your lipstick.
all right, that's the last straw. it's time to take out the trash. but first, i'm going to have to ask you to leave.
wrong!
sweet, trusting marge. i can't let you down. i'll get some money somehow. hello vegas? give me 100 bucks on red. all right, i'll send you a check. if only i could think of an invention. something that would really make money. must concentrate and work harder than i've ever worked...
but uh, could i just...
let me see! let me see! out of the way!
no, my invention! all my money problems could've...
oh, marge, my loyal wife, of course not. and lisa, my little princess. and who could forget dear rat boy?
that was in the third grade.
well, good luck finding it because i'm gonna take the numbers off tonight.
then i'll take off the numbers on my neighbor's house.
all right, you'll get your money.
time to fertilize the lawn. a couple five-hundred-pound bags should do it.
it means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
all right, you had your fun. now get lost.
hunh?
well, maybe i'll just stay and work overtime. my sisters-in-law are at my house again.
request permission to slink by.
but you're already smoking cig... you're really pushing it.
i'll have to trust you on that.
but... yes, ma'am.
rabsolutely rothing, rarge.
what paper?
i don't know marge, i can't be expected to keep track of all my wheelings and dealings.
i was ashamed, marge. i failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, i was a b-plus dog. i'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight.
nobody make me any breakfast. a man so deeply in debt doesn't deserve it.
in that case, i'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. but no powdered sugar, i don't deserve it. maybe a little powdered sugar.
oh, no wonder i didn't hear about bart being elected world's greatest sex machine. i'll never pay off that debt.
no. well anyway, turn it off.
hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. i'll be that carl reiner guy, you be what's his face.
sir, today every country has a national anthem. did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?
chauffeur's license, eh? mel, buckle your borscht belt!
look, all i ask is that you be fair.
you won't be happy 'til my family thinks i'm a loser, will you?
nagging the driver, minus ten points for you.
being a jerk, minus a million points.
i'll never forgive myself for this.
yes. i am in flavor country.
it's a big country.
please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides.
call off the debt?
call off the debt?
debt's off! let's go, marge. woo hoo!
woo hoo! mmmmm.
relaxed fit, my aunt fanny! stupid dockers! oh, the belt is buckled.
my ears are burning.
no, my ears are really burning. i wanted to see inside, so i lit a q-tip.
marge, is this a pimple or a boil?
it was a gummy bear.
bart simpson, meet jay sherman, the critic.
but, i'm still hungry.
yeah, well i won the belching contest at work.
whatcha doing, marge?
marge, do you respect my intelligence?
okay! wait a minute. why did it take you so long to say yes?
okay! wait a minute. are you humoring me?
yeah, well you think i'm stupid.
prove it. put me on that film jury festival thing.
exactly. heh, heh.
this contest is over. give that man the ten thousand dollars!
what'd i miss?
football in the groin. football in the groin.
good idea, marge. my mind is going a mile a minute.
oh great, now you're going to make fun of me.
wow. i'll never drink another beer.
i'll take ten.
aw, you know something marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket.
can i have some?
i've eaten eight different meats. i'm a true renaissance man.
woo hoo! oh, marge, that's great news!
oh, ah, but mr. milhouse, my little girl's getting married!
well, these seem to be in order. i'll be out back in the hammock.
whew! uh, enjoy.
you can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom i built. remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box.
oh, right.
so, hugh. have you heard all the latest american jokes? uh, here's a good one. pull my finger.
me and bart'll take hugh out on the town this afternoon.
great. there's only one thing i ask in return.
hugh, there's something i want you to have. my dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day i married marge, and they brought us good luck. i couldn't imagine a happier marriage. we don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive.
marge, it's so great to have the whole family together under one roof. i never realized how much i missed it. listen to the murmurs in the next room. the house is full of life again. keep it down in there!
you look great, sweetheart.
little lisa. lisa simpson. you know, i always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me.
see? you're still helping me.
aw, no...
i ate seven pounds of fudge!
the man at the stand said it was a record!
i rode the teacups! then i got a little sick and i had to sit down. but then i rode 'em again!
who spread garbage all over flanders' yard before i got a chance to?
my "best of ray stevens featuring the streak" album! so it was the dog that buried all our stuff!
oh my god! he's got the precious cable tv cable!
you got it.
don't worry. we'll catch him, or run him over tryin'.
two bucks to win on number eight... ...and have you seen my beloved dog? gimme the ticket.
you're lucky you got looks, marge.
yes! come on, you little horse!
aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. he misses casual sex.
yes, we've waited many years, but the good lord has finally blessed us with a real family.
get that cat out of the way!
do you have a better idea?
how do you explain the culottes, boy?
mainly your mother.
splendid. who's coming?
who wouldn't?
uh, i'm sorry, mr. burns, but you can't have these dogs. am i fired?
lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. you just go in every day and do it really half-assed. that's the american way.
well, it's always in the last place you look.
i know. and this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. it just keeps going faster and faster.
i'm with you, marge. lisa, get in here! in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics.
well, i've had just about enough of your vassar bashing young lady.
why you little...
really? wow.
kids are so naïve. lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says "do not feed the bears," man, you'd better not feed the bears. now get to school, boy.
woo hoo!
oh, right.
oh i'm sure he knew. and i'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy.
well, it's like the time that your cat, snowball, got run over.
what i'm saying is, all we have to do is go down to the pound and get a new jazzman.
i blew it again. mmmmmm.
lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, i recommend getting a tattoo. it preserves the things you love. starland vocal band?! they suck!
and i won't rest until i've gotten a hot dog.
ok, then this. doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... doo doo doo doo doo doo
they're butchering the classics. could that bassoon have come in any more late?
laser effects, mirrored balls. john williams must be rolling around in his grave.
we're outta here!
then how come that guy's winning?
no marge!!
marge, are you okay?
yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman.
nothing. i'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. and i have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.
aw, thanks, honey.
marge, i want you to take care of yourself out there. you've become very dear to me.
shush, dear, you'll wreck daddy's fun.
. fooled you flanders. made you think your family was dead. didja get it? they're not, though.
but you thought they were.
that's why it was so funny. but they're not.
are you kidding? being a cop-husband is one mighty sweet deal: this police radio entertains me with other peoples' miseries; we get a free funeral for marge, god forbid; and i can run background checks on whomever i want mohammar--
hey, hurry it up with the cards, lenny. i've got you clocked at two miles per hour.
all the more reason to hurry up. hey, what could be going a hundred miles per --
marge, you chased away all my poker buddies.
you're cooking what for dinner?
hey, marge. how's my little piglet?
that's okay. i'm supposed to be workin', too.
i'll just be a second, marge. i'm going to get some beer for those kids over there.
c'mon, we're family.
i'll make you a deal. you rip up that ticket, and i'll give you back your hat. wuh, wuh, wuh! hee, hee-hee!
what're you gonna do about it? what're you gonna do? ooh, i'm officer marge, i'm gonna arrest you! whoa! etc. whuh! marge, not here. hey, you're not really arresting me...?
i choose to waive that right.
i have nothing more to say to you, marge. i'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la "i love lucy" -- you stay on your side and i'll stay on my side.
all right guys, pipe down. i've got some more in the garage.
hmm... i wonder why he's so eager to go to the garage.
well, what do you call it?
okay.
herman, how could you? we've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? hard working designers, like calvin klein, gloria vanderbilt, or antoine bugle boy. these are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, "me too."
herman, your beef is with me. leave the girl out of this.
it's too late for me, marge! sell the jeans and live like a queen.
he's gettin' away! you blew it, marge!
marge, how did you know...
no, what i was wondering is...
yes there is, there's a garage full of counterfeit jeans.
yes, bart's a tutor now. tute on, son! tute on!
yes, there is. come on, everybody, let's go into shelbyville and get those kids back ourselves! i got an r.v. we can use... flanders's!
pile in, everybody! no time to wipe your feet!
found 'em! you kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this.
stupider like a fox! i'm okay.
oh, great. now i'm upside-down.
that's okay, son. i'll take care of him. faster, son -- he's got a taste for meat now!
sorry.
here's your package, mr. burns!
--son!
i hate my job. i mean, what's the point when your boss doesn't even remember your name?
what? what's your idea?
well, he's not all bad. he did send me this nice thank-you card.
kids, would you step outside for a second? f-f-f-f-f-f-
stop it, stop it, stop it! stop it!
what?
oh, you're a dead man! oh, you're dead! you're dead burns!
he can't remember my name!
berserk is right!! may i have some iced tea, please?
kids! kids! kids! as far as daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers.
sure! i've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
hey, i had a damn good reason. he could never remember my name...
homer simpson! homer simpson!
me! me! me, me!
yeah, right. you chose fruit, you live with fruit.
so you finally learned my name, eh?
i've got no time for your demented parlor games! you won't be telling anyone else that homer simpson shot you.
stop telling them it was me. i'll kill you for saying it was me.
yeah. and who the hell are you talkin' to? marge, do you have other men in this house? radioactive men?
which one were you? the ugly one? were you the ugly one?
guess what, kids. they're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here.
careful now. hey, didn't you direct "unnatural discretion"?
you guys work on the movie?
oh, i always wanted to be a teamster. so lazy and surly. mind if i relax next to you?
marge, there's a spider near my car keys.
ahhh, that's better. now that we're alone, papa bear has a li'l honey for his mama bear.
no we shan't. yoink!
oh, we'll clean up this afternoon.
i got my dad to look after her.
c'mon, honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. if anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you.
i love gettin' away from this dump.
we leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
saxa-ma-phone. saxa-ma-phone.
oh, marge, don't blame yourself. i'm the terrible parent. the boy bugs the hell outta me, i can't help lisa with her homework. the only thing i'm fit to take care of is a houseplant. lousy houseplant!
now wait a minute! okay, i'm not gonna win father of the year. in fact, i'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. wait, can i start again? fathering children is the best part of my day... i'd do anything for bart and lisa!
who? lady, you got the wrong file.
oh, maggie. i got nothing against maggie.
communication. gotcha.
i have listening skills!
shut up, judge!
garbage in garbage can. makes sense.
what i wouldn't give to hear lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
that's it.
todd smells. aw, i already knew that.
why you cotton pickin' --
i love you, cletus!
okay, okay, don't panic. to find flanders, i just have to think like flanders! the springfield river!
noooooooo!
oh, bartholemew, i feel like st. augustine of hippo after his conversion by ambrose of milan.
i said shut your ugly face, flanders.
yeah! gimme all the dirt!
old painty-can ned!
i'm not ashamed.
how about chairman moe's magic wok?
forty seconds? but i want it now.
ow! help me. why isn't anybody, ow, helping me?
mmm. sounds good.
wow, that's moe! the guy from the ad!
bart, you didn't finish your spaghetti and moe-balls! run, boy! run!
why? that was the problem in the first place. you were going broke because we were your only customers. wasn't that the problem in the first place? that you were going broke... moe? moe? hey, moe? oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha? what was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... moe? look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... moe?
let me get a pad....
no.
no.
that's the plan.
quiet, boy. i have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.
it was good, but not great.
shut up. so, ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?
sure. this barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but i'm sure you're up to it, marge.
you know what you should serve, marge? more of these lamb chops. these are the best ever.
lisa, get a hold of yourself. this is lamb... not a lamb.
ham?
pork chops?
yeah, right, lisa. a wonderful, magical animal.
look, kids! i just got my party invitations back from the printer's.
but all normal people love meat. if i went to a barbecue and there was no meat, i would say, "yo, goober! where's the meat?" i'm trying to impress people here, lisa. you don't win friends with salad.
wow, barney! you brought a whole beer keg.
i've got the prescription for you, doctor: another hot beef injection.
one whopper for the copper.
thanks flanders. i have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
i know.
lisa, you ruined my barbecue. i demand you apologize this second!
that's it! go to your room! marge, since i'm not talking to lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?
bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.
lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.
bart, go to your room!
i don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all.
i dunno. were you looking for me?
rock stars. is there anything they don't know?
i understand, honey. i used to believe in things when i was a kid. c'mon, i'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, i mean a veggie-back ride home.
i paid for a colossal donut, and i'm gonna get a colossal donut.
get what?
well... i acquired it legally, you can be sure of that.
i told you: flanders has it. or moe! go kill moe.
well... okay. if it'll end horror. don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?
we'll be right back.
bart?! is that you?
take out the garbage.
lousy smarch weather. do not touch willie. good advice.
oh yeah? well it's my house, so it's my spot.
did not.
you are?
they got me with their legal mumbo-jumbo.
i'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
hello? can anybody hear me?
i'm somewhere where i don't know where i am.
just a second... no, it's a place i've never been before.
what's going on here? i'm so bulgy... my stomach sticks way out in front and my...
hey, shut up! mmm... unprocessed fish sticks. man, this place looks expensive. i feel like i'm wasting a fortune just standing here. better make the most of it. ow! watch it, coney. oops. yes.
ow!
um, it's like, ahm... did anyone see the movie "tron"?
oh, there's so much i don't know about astrophysics. i wish i'd read that book by that wheelchair guy.
help! i don't have much time!
i'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... i'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... i'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! i don't know...
piece of cake, son! crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap!
someone's in here. nooo! nooo! nooo! nooo!
yeah! especially your big fat... oh, wait.
two!
arrgh! hey, where's charlie? how'd he get out of this?
hello.
um, could you give me a little push in the opposite direction?
thank you. carpal tunnel syndrome? no. lumber lung? no. juggler's despair? no. achy-breaky pelvis? no. oh, i'm never gonna be disabled. i'm sick of being so healthy! hey, wait... "hyper-obesity." "if you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."
yes i can.
i'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. but try to see it my way. all my life i've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body.
no. it would only worry her. if you want to add to her worries, go ahead. i guess i'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us.
yes, sweetheart?
oh yeah? well, we'll just see about that, little miss smart guy.
of course.
what can i do to speed the whole thing up, doctor?
i don't know... fish sandwich? are you sure? oh, two-twenty-five?! that means i lost weight!
woo hoo! four more pounds and my dream comes true: working at home...
i was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- honey, i'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability.
so that's it, isn't it, marge? looks. i didn't know you were so shallow.
beautiful. g'night. i've got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or i gotta face another day at work.
i need a miracle. oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut...
oh my. oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting.
thank you for your pity.
well, i use a computer!
i don't want to look like a weirdo. i'll just go with a muu-muu.
well, why don't you live in it then?
yes, honey?
you dragged me all the way from work for that?
i...
pro: i, uh... don't have to go to work.
pro: uhh... uhh... i love you?
marge, this is everything i've ever dreamed of, right here. and nobody's gonna take it away from me! you never had faith in me before. but let me tell you, the slim, lazy homer you knew is dead. now i'm a big fat dynamo. and where's that cake?
y... y... y... let's see, so many letters to choose from. i'll pick y. y, y... what the heck are you doing over there? there. there. you found the floor. yyy... y... y... y...
washing my fat guy hat, honey.
hey, what are you kids looking at?
don't make me close the shade!
nuts to that. i'm going to the movies.
what are you talking about?
i could sit in the aisle.
shame on all of you. give me my dignity! i just came here to see "honk if you're horny" in peace.
oh, that's raspberry.
get away, dammit! run for your lives!
let go! i gotta get to the tank!
wait a minute! there's probably a --
thank you, mr. burns. it was pretty scary up there. but... for a while i feared for my life.
woo hoo!
hey everybody! up here!
right away, mr. smithers! i'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --
best six hundred bucks i ever spent. c'mon, boy. we've earned this saturday, now let's make the most of it.
i don't like your attitude, you water-cooler dictator. what do you have in that secret government file, anyway? i have a right to read it.
"wife: marjorie. children: bartholomew, lisa..." aha! see, this thing is all screwed up. who the heck is "margaret" simpson?
i hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. hey, wait a minute... mom?
i thought you were dead.
yeah. well, where have you been all this time?
mom, there's something you should know about me. i almost always spoil the moment. i'm sorry.
i'll kwaanza you!
this is my room. this is my dresser. it's where i keep my shirts when i'm not wearing them.
mo-om! you're not looking!
woo hoo! i'm so glad to have my mom back! i never realized how much i missed her.
but?
first, it wasn't 25 years. it was 27 years. and second, she had a very good reason.
then why did she leave me?
wait a minute. there's one thing i don't understand. in all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?
oh, come on, mom. we use that same line on the kids when they're at camp.
hey!
rhetorical, eh? eight.
do i know what "rhetorical" means?!
you could live with grampa again.
mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?
thanks.
yak yak yak yak yak.
at least this time i'm awake for your goodbye.
don't forget me.
oh, yeah... but what i'll mainly remember is the laughter. i wonder what he's doing now?
heh, heh. why jerk my neck around like a goon when tyranno-vision decides what i should look at? oo, look, it's maggie! uh... maggie?
go back to massachusetts, pinko!
i'm sure they're fine, honey.
jump, boy! i gotcha!
now you, boy!
well, goodnight, son.
yeah.
good night, son.
we may be the best parents in the world.
goodnight.
there's nothing to worry about. now everyone go to sleep. good night.
somebody ate those cookies.
i think she's trying to tell us something.
go on, maggie. go. go.
wake up everybody! it's world war three!
aha! there you go. now that's not so bad, is it?
hello. my name is mr. burns. i believe you have a letter for me.
i don't know.
oooh! look at me, i'm making people happy. i'm the magical man from happyland in a gum drop house on lollipop lane! oh, by the way, i was being sarcastic.
i'll take care of this. ants!
don't mind if i do.
ooh, sorry. here's another one.
no, i work at the nuclear power plant.
woo hoo! ow!
bart, you're coming home.
or what? you'll release the dogs? or the bees? or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? well go ahead, do your worst.
young man, in this house, we use a little word called "please"...
gotta change maggie! dear god, we gotta change maggie!
marge, is lisa at camp granada?
'tis the season, marge! we only get thirty sweet, noggy days, then the government takes it away again!
oh, no, i'm not.
i wanna price some flip-flops and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!
uh-oh. somebody's got tired little legs. hmm. wonder where the flip-flops are.... "menswear?" maybe it's "sporting goods"... wait, no, "sleepwear"... oh, probably "better living."
well, maybe someone will give you one for christmas... pfft. must have been a pretty slow century.
what are you doing to my son?!!
eh, what are you gonna do?
check it out, boy! it's like looking into a living snow mirror!
get 'im, ma!
i don't think so, stupid!
the all igh-ty ollar? i get it.
ahhh... they never come around anymore now that they've got their mistresses.
well, you're closing. it's getting late. my kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. there's gotta be some other place we can go. think, moe. think.
i'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. i wannabe a league bowler. hey, we can be a team! woo hoo! we won! we won! excuse me, but my "team" is ready to bowl.
five hundred dollars?! no problem. would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?
aw, come on, marge! you're getting something in return! and i'm getting a bowling team. it's win/win!
burns never gives money to anybody. just last week, i asked him for fifteen hundred dollars.
ooh, i've got to get the third degree from you, too?
mr. burns, i, uh, was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team... for five hundred dollars.
oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us.
c'mon, guys. let's be the team that supports each other. you can do it otto / you can do it otto / help each other out, that'll be our motto...
domo aregatto, mister roboto...
the hardest shot in bowling. it was all up to me.
so i got up all my courage. right away, my lips started to move and i came up with a chant that won the match.
i don't know. you know, some guy. otto, i guess.
marge, you're missing the point. the individual doesn't matter. it was a team effort and i was the one who came up with the whole team idea. me.
there it is, boys, the championship trophy!
ah, ha, ha, ha, god-boy couldn't get a strike.
yeah, moe, that team sure did suck last night! they just plain sucked! i've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked!
gotta go. my damn wiener kids are listening.
"they made us!" that's loser talk! you gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! nothing's gonna stop us now!
by the way, rhyming homer with homer...
you want to join my what?
look, guys. it's not that simple, he's my boss. i'll tell you what: i'll give him a shot and if he stinks, it'll be easier to tell him no.
mr. burns, as team captain, it's my duty to inform you that...
awww.
you're off the team.
thanks.
i guess some people never change. or they quickly change, and then quickly change back.
saturday afternoon tv is so boring.
marge, i'm bored.
because i'm trying to reduce my boredom.
it's easier. duh.
uh, spray the boy. well, ready for the big rummage sale?
hey! what's wrong with this neighborhood? big shot. too good to buy a house here, snobby?
the guy who doesn't live there.
marge, that's the rhinestone nights fashion gun. i need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing.
oh. i wanted to write "disco stud" but i ran out of space. not that "disco stu" didn't get his share of the action!
uh, hey ned, lemme help you with that. hey everybody! who thinks flanders should shut up?
say. that ayatollah thinks he's better than america. is he right?
hey, big spender! / dig this blender! / rainbow suspenders!... hey, big spender!...
spend some dough at table three!
why did he have to move in on my territory? look at him. thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot. stupid president. why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
wait a minute. if lisa didn't vote for him, and i didn't vote for him--
hey, jerk! move your fanny!
hey! my taxes paid for that horn!
well, you can always depend on that.
first bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way i talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! well, that's it!
you owe me an apology!
oooh? hiding behind your goons, eh, bush? oooh! well, you are a wimp.
oh, i want trouble all right.
no, you're gonna get trouble.
trouble it is.
yoo hoo?
it's your sons, george bush jr. and jeb bush. come outside, dad!
okay, son! give him the glue!
it's time to hit him where he lives.
bingo.
it's all in the bible, son! it's the prankster's bible!
for the last time, bush, apologize for spanking my boy!
oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?
woo hoo! in your face, bush! now apologize for the tax hike.
former president gerald ford? put 'er there! i'm homer simpson.
do i ever!
jerry, i think you and i are gonna get along just fi--
sit down! / you're breaking -- / don't touch that--
i know a genuine panaphonics when i see it. and look, there's magnetbox and sorny.
sold! you wrap it up, i'll start bringin' in the pennies.
but sipowicz does it.
i wish i was sipowicz.
simpson family.
uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your mom's done fitting in.
boy, marge, you must've really done a number on those rich suckers.
that's one way.
not an issue.
huh?
just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, willya, marge?
seat down.
yes. woo hoooooooooo--
mmm, open-faced club sand wedge...
and what are you doing with his ball? and all those other balls?!
these aren't reptile eggs! you've been cheating! no matter where mr. burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green!
so you're not the best golfer here! wait'll i tell everyone about this! you stink!
bull-honkey! i don't care about joining this stupid club.
but marge, valets. for once, maybe someone will call me "sir," without adding "you're making a scene."
i just won't say anything, okay, honey? you kids should thank your mother. now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are.
our savings?!
they have beer and gum, right?
well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts.
hey marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans. wow.
don't worry, son. i'm sure he's up in heaven right now, laughing it up with all the other celebrities -- john dillinger, ty cobb, joseph stalin... i wish i were dead.
you think so?
ah! well, if you kids believe in me that much, i'll give it my best shot.
you su-diddily-uck, flanders! gimme that! hear ye! hear ye! ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! chooseth homer simpson and he shalt rock thy world!
less chat, more hat. woo hoo! hear ye! hear ye! the homer broadcasting system is on the air! all hollering, all the time! i'm gonna make the...
i don't understand thee, marge.
no tongue, eh? how did he talk and eat and laugh and love?
yes, that'd do.
the dastard!
of course i do. you're always right about this type of thing, and for once, i want in on the ground floor.
but you have proof! we could go get that confession out of jebediah's fife.
come on, we can use the baseball bat to smash open the case.
town crier. i'd like to ask you a few questions. one: where's the fife, and two: give me the fife.
no, it's homer.
i'm just waitin' for my kid.
okay, well, that's not gonna stop us. i know a much better way to get attention...
dig him up! dig up that corpse!! if you really love jebediah springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong! dig up his grave! pull out his tongue!
what a jip.
hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. let's go home.
no! nooooooo!!
oh, it's not your fault, honey. i'm supposed to be the responsible one. i shouldn't have let you let me get carried away.
all right! liver!
uh-huh. but this is the chair, right?
mr. burns has a mother!? she must be a hundred million years old!
heh, heh. taft, you old dog...
um, what do i do in case of fire?
just my luck.
uh, smithers already left, sir. i'm his replacement, homer simpson.
but i think the dodo went extinct...
i know. i'm taping it. i want to get to mr. burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
well, you can either get up or go back to sleep.
yes, sir, i did. the accounting department is located on the third floor. its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. the head of this department is a mr. johnson or johnstone. here are your messages: "you have 30 minutes to move your car," "you have 10 minutes," "your car has been impounded," "your car has been crushed into a cube," "you have 30 minutes to move your cube." hello. mr. burns' office.
it's mr. smithers. he's calling for you.
i'll have it on your desk in the morning, sir.
no time, marge. i think mr. burns wants me to do some long division.
yello?... it's for you.
no.
i punched mr. burns right in his 104 year-old face.
yes, sir.
hi, mr. burns. do you want your coffee now?
well, can i at least drive you home, mr. burns? it's five o'clock.
you shouldn't've gone away on vacation.
i just feel terrible about getting mr. smithers fired. that job was all he had. imagine how you'd feel, marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do.
mr. smithers, wait! you can't let yourself end up in a place like this. you've got two choices: you can give up on yourself and take the barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back.
you're on.
hello, mr. burns? this is your mother.
son, this is mrs. burns! i just called to say i don't love you. you are a bad son, montel!
you really blew it this time, smithers.
okay.
for knocking mr. burns out a third story window.
what am i -- a doctor?
bye, kids. on your way back, pick up a six pack of beer.
oh, why can't they just take the gun?
oh. i guess that's not him then.
oh, it's just bart and a mysterious stranger.
all right... wait a minute. for what?
forget it.
okay.
woo hoo! look, marge! a couple of bucks!
what for?
oh... forget it.
yeah, who'd've thought he'd turn out to be such a weirdo?
you know, his bizarre "personal" life? those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? why i heard...
troy mcclure? he's a washed-up movie star. he could be dating washed-up supermodels.
oh, i love legitimate theater.
i know! i know! it's selma, right?
that reminds me -- troy said something interesting last night at the bar. apparently he doesn't really love selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. well, enough talk. let's snuggle.
marge, could you close your eyes? i'm trying to sleep.
this has purple stuff inside. purple is a fruit. uh... oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. as a safety inspector, i am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs.
boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!
hi, lisa. how's your spring break going?
oh, owls, eh? so you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me...
great! ya wanna get some lunch?
well, it's a two-man operation, and you're the only man here i trust. ready?
they all have hilarious names and are delicious.
oh, that'd be great! sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... it'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store.
eh... truth. ask me anything.
hello, i'd like to speak with a mr. snotball? first name, ura?
ummm... do you have a crush on anyone?
i won't tell anybody.
moe thinks he knows a lot more than moe knows! well, just give me another chance, and i'll prove i can keep your secrets.
i've already forgotten his name. it was larsen something, right?
what's wrong, honey?
uh, you don't have to tell me, but i thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. i mean, i haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend.
i promise.
okay, we'll work this out together. first things first: where is knoxville?
well, maybe we could order something from oak ridge...
y'ello, oak ridge? this is springfield nuclear. we need to order a... uh...t-437 safety command console.
and have it sent to the springfield nuclear power plant, care of homer j.--
maybe it's time we put grampa in a home.
second class? what about social security, bus discounts, medic-alert jewelry, gold bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet.
who is it?
bart's room.
oh, can i come?
pass.
i'm sick of these constant bear attacks! it's like the freakin' country bear jamboroo around here.
hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. but i'm not gonna take it! who's with me?
mr. mayor, i hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears.
thank you, honey.
oh, how does it work?
uh-huh.
lisa, i want to buy your rock. woo-hoo! a perfect day -- zero bears, and one big fat hairy paycheck! hey... how come my pay is so low? bear patrol tax: $5?! what?! this is an outrage! it's the biggest tax increase in history!
let the bears pay the bear tax. i pay the homer tax.
well, anyway, i'm still outraged.
open your eyes, lisa. our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like bart have lost the will to learn.
oh my god. i got so swept up in the scapegoating and fun of proposition 24, i never stopped to think it might affect someone i cared about. you know what, apu... i am really, really gonna miss you.
yeah. those are exactly my sentimonies.
low and lazy, so -- hey! say something again.
hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue.
wow. you must love this country more than i love a cold beer on a hot christmas morning. darn it, apu, i'm not gonna let them kick you out! i never should have bought this button. can i have my three dollars back?
no, marge. apu convinced me that proposition 24 is a big mistake.
and i'm not registered!
oh. it can't be that many. c'mon, apu. i'll be your tutor. please identify this object.
uh... partial credit. now, they may ask you to locate your town on a map of the u.s, so let's do that. uh, springfield, springfield... ah, right here.
no, no, and no. maybe we should start all over with the electrical college.
sleep is for the weak, apu! now i'm gonna go to bed while you look over my notes from ninth grade history.
what?
hi, everyone. if i could just say a few words... i'd be a better public speaker.
when you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote "no" on proposition 24! no on 24! no on 24! no on 24! no - on - twen - ty - four!
well we'll have to organize a carpool. every day will be like a road trip!... with your dad!... to school!
pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?
but this is grand funk railroad! you guys back there know grand funk, right?
no, i'm not. i'm teaching you about rock music. now -- grand funk railroad paved the way for jefferson airplane, which cleared the way for jefferson starship. the stage was now set for the alan parsons project, which i believe was some sort of hovercraft...
i'm just trying to party with you guys.
oldies? but you've got all the top bands in here. styx? i just heard them on "the king biscuit flour hour." now here are some of your no-name bands: sonic youth, nine inch nails, hullabalooza...
back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible.
but most of all, i remember the music.
you wouldn't understand, dad. you're not with it.
no way, man. we're gonna keep on rocking forever... forever... forever...
i did? i must be getting forgetful in my old age. open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
well... what have we here? looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to hullabalooza.
you're not going to school today. today, your classroom will be the capitol city amphitheater. your teacher? four dozen rock bands. so get ready for some well-supervised craziness while you rock out with your father. woo hoo!
oh, my homemade kahlua.
oh, i get it.
hey, i've been safari-in' since before you were born.
well, excuuuuuuse me!
well, homer, this is it. time to get back with the people. the young people. alright. yeah. cool concert, am i right?
okay, i'm heading out now! more butt support! more butt support!
i'm fine.
i don't think i have a choice, marge.
how do you figure?
hi, everybody. is everybody... good? thank you. thank you very much. "stay in school. your hero, homer."
homer simpson, smiling politely. you know, my kids think you're the greatest. and thanks to your gloomy music they've finally stopped dreaming of a future i can't possibly provide.
all is well on tour with america's most popular alternative music festival... our first job is to entertain...
thank you! and remember: don't trust anyone over thirty. and now, peter frampton!
really? me, too. but i got kicked out 'cause of my views on vietnam. also, i was stealing projectors. anyway, get ready, beer belly! we're gonna show springfield what we're made of!
that was odd.
no biggie. i'm cool.
rules. i'm a rocker. i don't care for rules.
people know your name, but you don't know theirs. it's great.
nope.
you know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- christianity. what's with all the questions?
sure, we've got a lotta catchin' up to do.
oh, marge. i thought i had an appetite for destruction, but all i wanted was a club sandwich.
you have a desk?
i'll miss you pumpkins, but i just can't share your bleak world view. i've got too much to live for.
you know what the song says, "it's hip to be square."
wait, marge. maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool.
i only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?
deal. see, flanders, you give a little, you get a little.
well, i have been eating more...
i left a few helpful notes around the house...
i'll take that.
it's low tide, boys.
ooh, captain of the football team! he's a dreamboat! don't wait up, marge.
you've got friends. you got "the dud" right here. stand up for yourself, poindexter!
all right.
no lighter?... nothin'? wait, i got it.
sweet merciful crap! my car!
attic? oh, that's silly. seriously, though, don't ever go up there.
yeah, yeah. i'll go feed it. fish heads, fish heads, do de do de doo...
no more questions. i work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do i -- what?
yeah, three nosy kids. and you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?
lisa, please. yes, bart, you have a twin brother. you see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity.
we chained hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
we'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to.
right. bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.
i suppose you'll want to probe me. well, might as well get it over with.
i guess you mean president clinton. he usually hangs around washington, d.c.
except... um, there's this election next week, so after that it might not be him anymore. it might be what's-his-name, uh, mumbly-joe... uh, i saw him on tv the other... uh, bob dole.
oh no. aliens... bio-duplication... nude conspiracies... oh my god! lyndon larouche was right!
marge, marge! there i was, i had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when i was abducted by a flying saucer!
that's one of the creatures!
these candidates make me want to vomit in terror! i've got to stop them!
stop! those candidates are phonies! you heard me -- they're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
america, take a good look at your beloved candidates! they're nothing but hideous space reptiles!
don't blame me. i voted for kodos.
of course not. i wouldn't do that. why not?
but marge, this is a chance for me to fulfill my lifelong dream.
just bring the rut with you, honey. come on, take a look.
ah, let's watch something else.
oh yeah, that's right. let's watch this.
well! what do you think of me and cypress creek now, marge?
heeeeey...
yes.
okily dokily.
i'm gonna miss springfield. this town's been awfully good to us.
wow! my boss!
okay...
yes, once.
wowww.
wow.
uh... to work for you?
um... someday i'd like to own the dallas cowboys.
yeah.
don't worry. that won't take long.
all right.
doh!
are you guys working?
hey, call me homer.
tom landry's hat! and it's autographed! "to berman's dry cleaning, best wishes, tom landry."
i can't buy that. only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. guys like me? i'm a guy like me!
tired, eh? what you guys need... is hammocks.
uh-huh.
got it...
umm-hmmm...
yes...
oh, the hammock district.
fine.
yes.
oh.
any sugar around here?
uh... yessir. no problemo.
france.
i've never noticed this office before.
eh... i... no.
aargh!
well...
well, the simpson men are doing fine, right, bart? you haven't even gotten in trouble at school.
uh, i've got a problem, hank.
well, it's pretty important. say, what's going on?
aw, those jerks. always walking over the small businessman. don't get me started about the government.
well, my family wants to move back to springfield.
well... thanks for everything, hank.
"project arcturus couldn't have succeeded without you. this will get you a little closer to that dream of yours. it's not the dallas cowboys, but it's a start. drop me a line if you're on the east coast, hank scorpio." aw, the denver broncos.
yeah yeah.
you just don't understand football, marge.
like bull you don't! come on!
no, i'm not!
marge, look! the world's best jacket! if i had this it would show everybody... show everybody!
son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. you've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. coming to me was a good start.
the thing is -- oof! -- bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
big deal. i didn't even get my kid's belt back. the only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
really?
dressing?
yes!
yes!
yes!!
woo hoo!
you used to be a boxer just like me?
hey, what's this?
you know lucius sweet? he's one of the biggest names in boxing! he's exactly as rich and as famous as don king, and he looks just like him, too.
why not?
no problemo.
oh, why me?
just a second.
all right... ready... wait a minute... all right... wait a minute... just a sec...
no one.
never.
nothing.
brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?
you... didn't?
uh, sure.
ooh, "general!" who's drederick tatum, anyway? is he another hobo?
well, i trust you, moe. if you say i can beat this guy, then he doesn't stand a chance.
aw, c'mon, i'll make a fortune for one night's work! we could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --
marge, will you let me finish? ...plug-in room deodorizers, front and rear spoilers for the car --
well, i don't think it's that unlikely.
all right, i think we've heard just about enough from mr. newspaper today.
okay, homer, nothing to be worried about... just--
are you an angel?
but you stopped the fight. won't everyone be mad at you?
i can't remember where we parked.
where are you going?
yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today.
twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
can't they get a pole for that sign?
and what if he's not? then we'd look like idiots.
oh, yes we are!
oh, yes, there is!
and i think it's the best idea i've ever had! we're picking up the weirdo, and that's final.
wow, that's really lazy.
so lazy.
why? it's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
yes, sir. i do.
eh, i should go.
it's so unfair. you're everything a dad could hope for.
larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. and that... is a phony kidnapping.
pho-ny kid-napping...
of course not. we'll decide that on a drifter-by-drifter basis.
hello, mr. burns, this is the kidnapper. do you miss your son?
if you really love larry, prove it and you can have him back today.
don't you care about your son? this is more important than money!
no!
marge, it's not a real kidnapping. it's a simple hoax to win a father's love.
still?
what... but... marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!
heh-heh, they'll never look for us here.
you don't like it, call the cops!
hold on, mr. burns. maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? all your son wanted was a little attention, a little love. i'm a father myself, sir. and sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky -- -- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.
it's a party, marge. it doesn't have to make sense.
someone found my keys!
no problem... can do.
right... uh huh... gotcha... cat in the furnace.
a whole week of just father and son! see you at dinner.
all right. just wake me up.
no, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda.
do i have to sit up?
knock yourself out.
'preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. and i gotta live with him.
no! wait! wait! madam, i run a house of discipline. the boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. good day. oh, i don't know how to punish you! what does marge usually do?
c'mon, boy. give your old man a little credit. yeah, well, i still get to punish you.
i told you last night, no! where is bart, anyway? his dinner's getting all cold and eaten.
yes, everyone loves rules...
oh, yeah, drugs. ya gotta have drugs.
helen, as a responsible parent, i was already well aware of that.
oh, no?! well, if homer simpson wants his ten-year-old son working in a burlesque house, then homer simpson's ten-year-old son is going to work in a burlesque house! that's... hi! now, marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about bart working in a burlesque house...
i was trying to punish him exactly like you would. so, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. this is your mess and i'll be damned if i'm gonna clean it up!
don't you worry, son. my friends! stop!
sure, we could tear this house down... no! my friends! stop! let me finish. we could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves... you could close down moe's or the kwik-e-mart, and nobody would care / but the heart and soul of springfield's in our maison derriere...
what are you doing, marge? didn't you hear the song?
hey...
easy...
yoink.
keep it down in there, everybody.
oh, i hate having parties. the toilet always gets backed up.
oh, we can't afford that. who do you think i am, liz taylor?
marge, we're not talking about a toothbrush here.
whaaaaaat?!
you know what you two need? a little comic strip called "love is." it's about two naked eight year olds who are married.
shut up and let the woman talk.
boring!
ooh, here we go!
g'night... thanks for coming... we'll see you... ba-bye... well, i think that went pretty well.
marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago.
you can't keep blaming yourself. just blame yourself once and move on.
the one down the hall.
thanks for introducing me.
for what?
i don't wanna go to that.
that doesn't sound like something i'd say.
can i borrow a feeling? "can i borrow a feeling?" there's your picture on the front.
i already did.
oh yeah. you gotta do that.
oh, and for yourself.
ooh, that's tough, pal. but it's never going to happen to me.
'cause marge and i have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
lisa, wait! i know you're only eight years old and i don't wanna put a lot of pressure on you, but you've got to save my marriage.
all right. as you know, there's been a lot of talk about divorce lately, and i think your mom might not be happy with me.
mm-hm.
oh, i knew this would happen. our whole marriage started off on the wrong foot.
that's your advice?! go to bed!
oh, of course, my sweet. i'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you.
ooh! you're feisty. i'm gonna give you a madonna cut.
marge? can you come in here? we need to talk.
no, it's a second wedding, honey. our first one was so crummy, i had to make it up to you. i really love you.
yes, we do. i got us a divorce this afternoon.
wait! i want one last chance to enjoy single life. okay, ready.
it doesn't matter. all i want to know is: will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?
whaddya mean?
well, it was like that when i got here. it really was.
telemarketing, eh?
i won't.
let me show you how it works. this baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. it automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. listen.
now we just sit by the mailbox and watch the money roll in!
oh, no you don't!
will you two shut up?! people are trying to sleep!!
lisa's window is the next one!
shut up!!
... is it... wah?
oh, lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting springfield.
oh, i'm sure i'd be a third wheel.
i would make it my business to be a third wheel.
use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
all clear, everyone.
relax. can't you see how eerily calm it is? see? i told you it was over. hmm. i don't remember a bowling alley being th--
he fell for it! way to go, marge!
well, call us if you need anything.
hope you like it, neighbor. we didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love.
eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad. your beautiful kitchen, ned. just as you remember it.
so, flanders, what do you think of the house that love built? aw, shoot.
oh, him.
i... what?
past instances in which i professed to like you were fraudulent.
i engaged in intercourse with your spouse or significant other. now that's psychiatry! eh? eh?
you know what your problem is, flanders? you're afraid to be human.
c'mon, flanders. there's got to be something you hate. what about mosquito bites?
what about, uh, fluorescent lights?
see? you like everything.
you're nuts. i gotta get some fresh air.
what's wrong with you? what are you trying to hide from m-- what's that smell? onions... chili powder... cumin... juicy ground chuck... it's chili! oh my god, i'm missing the chili cook-off! i'm missing the cook-off! it's going on right now and i'm missin' it!
okay, quit naggin' me. i won't have any beer. geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?
marge, we're missing the chili! less artsy, more fartsy! fine. i'll come find you when i'm ready to stop having fun.
five-alarm chili, eh?
one... two... hey, what's the big idea?
hmmm. a bland, timid entry -- suitable, perhaps, for patients recovering from surgery. heh, heh, heh.
hello, chief.
but i need it! aw, lousy wiggum. now the whole town thinks i'm a chili wuss...
maybe i do, son. maybe i do. outstanding.
well, chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is. heh, heh! my finest hour! and marge wasn't even here to see it. ooh. i don't feel so good. flanders! you gotta help me!
what's happening to me? okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with marge, ate guatemalan insanity peppers. then i -- ohhhh.
hiya.
if it's about laying off the insanity peppers, i'm way ahead of you.
yeah, that's me all right.
but what should i do? should i meditate? should i get rid of all my possessions?
look, just gimme some inner peace, or i'll mop the floor with ya.
soul mate?
that's it? well, that's marge. big deal. great spiritual quest, wolfie. my soul mate is marge.
hey, wait! come back!... a ghost train! and so little time to get out of the way!... now less!... now none!
hey, wait a minute. there's no such thing as a talking dog.
hi, kids.
where's your mother?
hi, honey. uh-oh. i guess you're cranky because i didn't come home last night...
okay. that coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but marge doesn't understand me at all. maybe we're not kindred spirits. we don't have anything in common... look at these records! jim nabors, glen campbell, the doodletown pipers! now look at her records... they stink! maybe i had that crazy dream for a reason... wherever my soul mate is, it's not here. ...i always just figured my wife was my soul mate. but if it's not marge, then who is it? where do i begin looking?
well what about you, lenny?
where? where?!
alone! i'm alone! i'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun! a ship! a ship with people! i know... i'll bring them to me! and then they'll have to be my friends! come here, people!
marge?
really? you were? but how did you find me?
or that little guy on the "don't walk" sign.
wow, marge, you really do understand me. see, i thought we weren't soul mates because...
oh, sure. give me the one with all the monsters.
...but our sames go right down to the bone. maybe we do have a...
hey... we do! oh, marge! we're number one! we're number one! in your face, space coyote!
omigod! the ship!
we sure did... soul mate.
don't worry, i have a plan. i saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. i think it was called "the bus that couldn't slow down." first, i hook this common vcr into the security camera system like so... then, i insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop...
nah, it's friday night moe. i wanna try something special.
skoal! wait a minute -- this is duff!
eh, i guess i'll walk home.
no time for you, old man!
please, don't hurt me!
yaaaa... uh!
no! well, ten beers...
oh, yeah? well, when i came to, i was covered with a sticky translucent goo! explain that!
so?
oh. it's bart. i can't believe it. i'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
lousy loveable dog.
you don't have to humiliate me.
no, i'm sorry.
yes.
we were sitting in barney's car eating packets of mustard. ya happy? you are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. if i wasn't married, i'd go out with you like that.
you do?! oh, marge, you've made me so happy!
thanks! i'd love an omelet right about now.
no, i can't. this is my cause. i'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. what was his name? apollo creed?
well then, good night!
oh, i suppose you're going to mock me, too.
you do?
thank you, son. and do you think you could stop the casual swearing?
we'll fake it and sell it to the fox network.
now son, they do a lot of quality programming, too.
now, son, you don't want to drink beer. that's for daddies, and kids with fake ids... besides, it's such a beautiful night. how about a ghost story?
no! no! no-o-o-o-o!
as a representative of planet earth, let me be the first to say... bwah! bwah! bwaaaaah! it's gone. and we still don't have any proof.
good work, son! we did it! we did it!
uh... the second one. zilliphone. next question.
uh, yes.
take a look at this, lisa. you don't see any "homer is a dope" t-shirts, do you?
i'll take two! look! there it is!
thanks, marge.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. when are the pancakes coming in the mail?
no deal, mccutcheon. that moon money is mine!
uh, your fish are dead.
hey, pretzels!
that's right, lenny. let's all give in to deliciousness, the pretzel wagon way.
you could call 'em whitey whackers.
oh, i guess i should speak to the executor of his estate.
i had a feeling things would work out for you, honey.
thanks, moe.
hey, fat tony! you still with the mafia?
you mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? oh, fat tony... i will say good day to you, sir.
in those words? yes.
how could i not? i saw you pouring your heart and soul into this business and getting nowhere. i saw you desperately trying to cram one more salty treat into america's already bloated snack-hole. so i did what i could. i did what any loving husband would do: i reached out to some violent mobsters.
oh, thank god. it's only grampa. now what?
you heard her. she said "no."
but marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet. look at him. he's gonna do something. and you know it's gonna be good!
hey, that's the fire alarm!
woo hoo!
hit 'em, carl! you too, lenny!
huh?
hmmm. your ideas are intriguing to me, and i wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but i think we have to go on the retreat anyway.
uh, i lost my map.
hey, this sounds like fun.
uh-oh.
oooh.
yes, lotta hysteria...
mr. burns, i insist that we cheat!
wow. you sure know how to cheat, mr. burns.
no sir. i am not.
you know, mr. burns, you're the richest guy i know. way richer than lenny.
oh, these sure are comfortable chairs.
oh, man, you are so right. did you ever sit like this?
why get up? here's a little move i've been tinkering with. say i want that bowl of dip.
use it wisely, my friend.
you got it, buddy.
um, i don't see one. unless... no. there's no way out.
you can supervise me.
shhh! you're causing more avalanches. . i think they've stopped. .
so what?
it could be days before they find us.
we could build snowmen.
agreed.
uh, they're just snowmen, mr. burns.
what do we do?
you and what army?
oh lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house.
marge, kids.
you said it, ya weirdo.
marge, get me a beer.
oh, there's no way i could --
now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. i'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. just like my hair!
marge, whatever it takes to make you well, we'll do it.
but how am i supposed to pay for that?
didn't he lisa? didn't he? hey, wait a minute, he didn't!
all right, marge. i'll get you your nanny, and to pay for it... i'll give up the civil war re-creation society i love so much.
wait a minute, marge. i saw mrs. doubtfire. this is a man in drag! you're phony! fakey phony broad!
sorry.
i hide a bottle of schnapps in the baby's crib.
might i add -- no fat chicks.
and one who will work for minimum wage--
did you say mary pop--
marge, do we know them?
come on -- isn't he the guy i bowl with? the black guy? oh yeah. so, you worked for carl, eh?
ooh, she is tough.
i'll say. her butt waxed the banister.
no, no. leave it in.
not till you're fifteen.
ooh, i can't get enough of this blood pudding.
blood, uch! i'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank you.
shary bobbins! i want another beer!
you'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
oh, that poor woman.
nope.
shut up, flanders.
i'm sure we will, honey. i'm sure we will.
yeah, hi, roy. hey, they're having open casting for the voice of poochie.
i do not!
hey, this is homer simpson sayin' "howdy" to all the girls out there in radioland. hey, this is homer simpson sayin'-- i don't sound like that, do i? oh, i don't like having such a hilarious voice.
oh, "no attitude," eh? not "in-your-face," huh? well, you can cram it with walnuts, ugly!
huh? i can't. i don't remember what i did.
oh, i don't get the job, do i? well, boo-hoo, i don't get to be a cartoon dog.
she smells sheet smells by the sheet store. wait, wait. lemme try it again.
you? but you're a lady.
hey, it really is you! how'd you get to be so good?
you mean "meep meep"?
what the hell are you talking about?
quiet! you're missing the jokes!
well? what did everybody think?
so it was pretty okay, huh?
put a sock in it, roy.
no i am not.
never! you can't just kill off a classic tv character. poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. that's why i'm gonna read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands.
yes. i certainly do. hello there, itchy. i know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish i would go away, but i think we got off on the wrong foot. i know i can come off a little proactive, and for that i'm sorry. but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, i know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together.
nine hundred dollars? well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again.
that is so true.
what happened?
give her a break! her husband was killed!
oh, yeah. like when a clown dies.
and that kind of stuff is worth money?
man, you should come over to our place. it's full of valuable, worthless crap!
i practically insist. shall we say, 5 o'clock? the snacking hour?
ow! why you little...
oh. i'll just be another minute, john. have a seat.
that john is the greatest guy in the world. we've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there...
who doesn't?
right...
am i, marge? am i? think of the property values! now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!
whoa, not me. and not because john's gay, but because he's a sneak. he should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way.
no! no, no, no, no...
no, no! i'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!
oh, and i'm not.
bart! where'd you get that shirt?
right. thank you. i hope you realize this is all your fault. i mean, do you have to be so effeminate around the boy?
all right, boy! come on! today we're gonna--
you! i should have known!
look, john, you seem like a perfectly nice guy and all. just stay the hell away from my family!
you know. it's... it's not... usual! if there was a law, it would be against it!
no i'm not, marge! they're embarrassing me! they're embarrassing america! they turned the navy into a floating joke! they ruined all our best names, like bruce and lance and julian! those were the toughest names we had, now they're just...
yeah! and that's another thing! i resent "you people" using that word. that's our word for making fun of you. we need it! well, i'm taking back our word and i'm taking back my son! homer storms out.
just a couple of good ol'-fashion manly places. father and son. just remember, son, whatever happens --i'll always love you. ... as a father! a father!! a regular father!! whooh!
that's a good start. let's get you a pack. what's your brand?
okay, that didn't work. but i know something that will...
roscoe here runs this mill. he's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real all-american joes doin' what they do best.
you'll thank me on your wedding night.
i don't know! this is a nightmare! you're all sick!
ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! the whole world's gone gay! oh, my god, what's happening now?
but what would turn bart into a man fast? you have to think for me!
hunting, eh?
it just does! name me one gay indian!
butt out, butt-insky! what would you know about hunting?
hang onto it, toy-boy! you might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!
no, boy. you can't drive, you're only 10. you're going hunting!
well... but... wait a minute. bart's not fixed yet! he hasn't even --
oh, she'd never go. she's a vegetarian.
no... this whole thing is my fault. i've been a lousy dad.
yep, and it's your shot, son.
bart, i'm gonna turn my back -- and when i turn around, i wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer. attaway, son! you made your old man proud!
me too, son.
son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- gaahhh!! unnghh!!
just... my bones... and organs...
it's a miracle!
i've been tenderized.
amen to that.
oh, all those stairs...
and sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --
in a medium-security prison.
unless he gets out somehow.
or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before.
lisa too?
well, i hope bob fed you, 'cause i ate your dinners.
you like parties, huh? well, i just remembered they're having a big one down at the waterfront this weekend.
the important thing is i didn't imagine it.
uh, gee, i'd really love to want to help you, flanders, but uh, marge was taken prisoner in the... holy land and uh...
i'll have to ask her.
going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
oh, it's like a rent-a-car, son. you get all the mileage you can. then ball it up and cram it through the mail slot.
take it like a man, boy. and do everything your little sister says.
all right, all right, geez. okay, honey, remember where we're parked.
you've never been?
nah, i'm really more of a slacker.
wow, even moe's moved to fancy new digs.
oh, come on marge, relax! lisa's in charge. she's the responsible one.
give me the drugs, lisa.
i'll come with you.
prohibition! they tried that in the movies and it didn't work. i predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
glad you're finally back in business, moe.
no.
now don't say that! alcohol is a way of life. alcohol is my way of life. and i aim to keep it!
right. now remember, don't mention this to anyone. not your mother, not rex banner, not anyone.
really? i heard good.
nothin'.
before! before! you're living in the past, marge! quit living in the past.
oh, i'm not going to lie to you, marge. so long!
i can explain, marge! please let me explain! oh, why won't you let me explain!!!
well -- and i can explain, remember -- i fill the balls with beer that i found at the dump, then i bowl them and some underground pipes take them into moe's.
huh?
no you won't.
won't.
hey, boy, get crackin'! moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!
call me beer baron.
sorry, i'm all out. wha-- how about some turpentine? or caulk? delicious caulk...
"make it," eh?
i said forty-two!
remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. we're patriots. like... all those people in jail.
uh... nothing, marge. i think it must have been that bean i had for dinner. ka-boom! blam! oh, excuse me again, dear.
what, dear? ka-blammo.
boom. i'll be right back. it's hot! i thought about what you said, honey, and i've decided to quit.
geez, what happened to you, wiggum? you look terrible.
poor wiggum.
i'll bet you really hate rex banner, huh?
the guy who took your job.
hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?
i filled the balls with a funnel.
aw, probably just a slap on the wrist...
last time i help you.
well, sorry, i'm not in that business anymore.
mayday! mayday!
wait a minute. bart's teacher's name is "krabappel?" i've been calling her "crandall." why didn't someone tell me? oh, i've been making an idiot out of myself.
give me that! bart, this is your father. do you know where the remote is? i looked all over the house.
it was in... it was in my pocket.
yes! my precious "cartoons!" "who pumped ethyl?!"
marge, mail's here.
wow! a golf shirt! with my corporate logo on it! oh, it smells like salmon, too! thanks, boy!
hi marge, hi santa's little helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not santa's little helper.
oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day.
geez, that dog has more education than i do. he's some kinda super dog. hey, where'd he go?
oh, i don't know about this dog. he's kinda... snooty.
do you think he noticed?
no! bart had his turn, let me! i can't resist his charms.
wow, tv's kent brockman.
you want some puppies, eh, mr. brockman?
i'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable.
he better know how to keep his mouth shut.
you gave both dogs away?! you know how i feel about giving!
there, there, shut up, boy. we'll just get you a new dog.
well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. so you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!
oh good.
marge!
hey, i know where there's lots of paper!
oh, okay.
oh, yes! gather 'round, my son, and i shall tell you a tale...
no, the bank put lenny in charge.
hey, why don't you try the old folks home? they practically live in their own filth!
you're welcome, honey.
lisa! you have a guest! so, um, how's life in the gutter?
see that, boy? why aren't you making any business deals?
please be flanders, please be flanders, please be flanders...
good one, mom! / you're so bad, honey.
uh-huh.
oh, i hope you learned your lesson, lisa. never help anyone.
i made a bad mistake and lenny sent me home to think about what i did. but i don't remember what it was so i'm watching tv.
oh, i'd love to go with you, honey, but i've got a lot of work to do around the bed.
dammit!!
who cares? this is the best part of the week!
yeah. we're gonna get rid of the christmas tree. it's starting to turn brown. wanna come with?
it's your life.
volunteering is for suckers! do you know that so-called "volunteers" don't even get paid?
but marge, i'm obsessed with it! where did it come from? what is it a box of? how'd my face get on it?!
akira, can you read this for me?
hokkaido, eh?
y-y-y-yes.
yes. this is homer simpson from america. who may i say is speaking to me?
uh, hello? why am i mr. sparkle?
well, i am mr. sparkle!
put it in! put it in!
that didn't explain anything. all i know is they stole my face and used it for their stupid "logo". there's no other explanation.
well, it was a good ride while it lasted. c'mon kids. let's go home.
that was fast.
no, run around in circles!
now that's religion.
can i have this one?
chair goes round... chair goes round.
i don't know. i'm kind of dizzy. i should probably go home sick.
wow. you've got pencils with your name on 'em. just like a pencil company executive. i'd give anything for one of these.
i didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a little tip. if you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.
okay, grimy!
huh? oh. oh, i'm sorry.
check.
i wish i had a nickel for every time i've heard that. take me out to the ball game / take me out to the ball! so what's new, grimy?
acid, eh? gee, that would have been stupid. boy would my face have been red!
he did.
he likes you.
hi, grimy, old buddy.
no, i won't accept that.
oh, what'll i do, moe?
do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
marge -- perfect. bart -- perfect. other kid -- perfect.
welcome-to-the-simpson-residence-or-casa-de-simpson-as-i-call-it-heh-heh-heh-heh.
it is. it is. but first let me introduce you to my family. my perfect family. this is my wife, marge...
... and our beautiful baby. my daughter, lisa -- i.q. 156.
see. and my son, bart -- he owns a factory downtown.
wow.
yeah, that's me all right. and the guy standing next to me is president gerald ford. and this is when i was on tour with the smashing pumpkins. oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space.
sure. you've never been? would you like to see my grammy award?
what?
the car won't start. and i don't feel very good today. i am at work.
wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. you're crazy, marge. get off the road.
no he won't. he hates me.
yeah, yeah, that's his problem. he's a nut. it's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!
oh. design your own power plant, eh? this is my chance to show everyone how professional i am. lenny, tell mr. burns i've gone home to work on the contest.
marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?
well, basically i just copied the plant we have now...
hey, you okay, grimy?
change the channel, marge.
over there.
ah, grrrreetings!
dad? is that really you?
i'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
b-b-before the show, you said we were having a special ghost tonight!
marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?
honey, i'm home! it's not a plant, marge, it's a tree, and i've nearly chewed through it. now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight.
well, i know one thing in this world that's still pure and good.
no... candy! sweet, sweet candy. i want candy!
i want candy!
i wish our special guest tim conway didn't have to leave so soon.
no, no! your room is full of toys. you're going to the, uh, garage!
not very.
well, i'm sorry if you heard "disneyland", but i distinctly said "military school."
if, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?
that's not so disciplined.
i guess.
leggo my leg.
son, for the last time, you're staying at military school.
uh, yeah. i've always said the boy could use more confidence.
well, kids, we're so proud of the way you completed military school, we thought this time we'd take you to disneyland for real!
'evening, moe.
you got the black one. hey everybody, i'm peter pantsless!
so you lost my car, eh? well, that's just grand. i ought to punch you in the nose, but i have to pick up my kids at school.
marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts.
throw it away! nothing good has ever come out of new york city!
my vehicle!
new york is a hellhole, and you know how i feel about hellholes.
it's time i told you about a chapter of my life i hoped would be closed forever. i was on my way to the harrisburg coat outlet to buy an irregular coat. but it required a stopover in new york city.
lousy bart... his money... all right, new york, i'm coming back. but you're not getting this!
don't you start.
oh. hi.
good. i don't want to spend one extra second in this urban death-maze. you wait here at the bus station while i get the car.
oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy. i'm on to you!
hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?
geez! that's just... awful!
blech! eww! geesh! i'll take a crab juice. uh-oh. uhh... you got a men's room in there?
but i can't leave my car until the parking guy gets here. oh, why did i drink all that crab juice? mmmmm.
shut up! shut up! shut up!
ow!
we're getting outta here, now! jump in, marge! trust me! throw the kids! no time for the baby!
come on! let's go! everyone into the car! now!
we'll see, honey. we'll see.
look, lady, you obviously have at least one son.
or "crapweeds".
not if they were called "scumdrops".
and why are you and the old lady in the car?
and why am i here?
and why are the kids here?
and why is grampa here?
can i see your copy of "swank", armin?
now, if you'll allow me, i think i have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let sgt. skinner keep his dignity.
and we salute you for it. now don't come back.
oh no we don't! judge snyder?
guessing how much elvis weighed...
what a bad father. lisa, knock off that racket!
i'll practice you!
bart, make her stop.
lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better i'll destroy something bart loves.
you don't remember how you got it?
oh, well, it all happened in 1990. back then, the artist formerly known as prince was currently known as prince. tracey ullman was entertaining america with songs, sketches, and crudely-drawn filler material. and bart was eagerly awaiting his first day of school...
now, son, on your first day of school, i'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me...
lousy traumatic childhood.
and that, my children, is the story of bart's first day of school.
yeah.
no problem. i'll just give her a sip of beer. come on maggie -- it's miller time! yes-it's-mil-ler-time!
oh, my father gave me beer as a child. till i wrapped my little red wagon around a tree.
brilliant! i have absolutely no idea what's going on.
oh, it's beautiful! oh! oh, let's put bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!
oh, all right. what a- burn it! send it to hell!
get it away!
wait a minute... she's right!
marge, he's five. his life is over. lisa's the wave of the future.
wow. just think of the possibilities.
nah.
well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her.
i'll give ya fifty bucks.
seventy-five.
excellente! muchas gracias, señorata!
you do that.
dad, what are you doin' here?
ohhh. so hottt.
uh-uh. forget it marge. there is no way i am spending my saturdays at a museum. unless... museums don't have foosball, do they? you lose, michelangelo's david. who's next?
oh, marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! and our stopgap solution is getting cranky.
marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning.
no need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
up up up up up up up. if "ifs" and "buts" were candy and nuts y... how does the rest of that go?
what, flanders.
well, i admit it looks bad, flanders, but haven't you heard of "let he who is without sin cast the first stone?"
she has a gift.
ohh! saxomophone. two hundred dollars! oh, i'll take it.
next, i'll tell you the origin of maggie's pacifier.
ohhhh, but marge! am i doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?
will you get off my front lawn?
why -- oh, i give up.
lisa! enough saxomophone already!
stupid hippo.
stupid frog.
relax, i built a bomb shelter.
good.
so do i.
you should be.
you're mutants?
go to hell, cloaky! safe at last. that better not be the mutants.
marge! kids! you're alive!
ohh, com'ere.
now that's the marge i married.
hmmm, two bucks... and it only transports matter? umm... well, ah... i'll give you 35 cents.
i said i'll take it.
sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. if you don't use it responsibly... kablamo!
it was your mother.
i think she's right. the pants are a dead giveaway.
so then lenny says, "as if! don't even go there, sister."
yeah, well lenny said it.
eh, it'll turn up somewhere.
get 'im, boy! smash that fly! mush him up good! nice work, son.
nobody likes a tattletale, honey.
well, we were lucky this time. but it's all too clear that some things in this universe aren't meant to be trifled with.
something i should have done a long time ago. i'll teach you to mess with my machine! i'm gonna chop you good! that cost me 35 cents! you're just making it worse. i promise i won't hurt you.
woo hoo! i accuse goody flanders.
they're in my hair! they're in my hair!
c'mon, give us some candy. don't pretend you're not home!
she's a witch!
oh, i've never heard of those people.
woo hoo!
yes, yes, oh god yes!
bo-ring!
all done.
relax, marge. if someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know.
what did i tell you, marge?
oh, let's get that.
five hundred dollars! forget it.
i wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are.
i couldn't agree more, marjorie. you deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have.
i don't have to be careful, i got a gun.
baby.
mmm-hmm.
ahh.
ooo, i like the sound of that.
five days! but i'm mad now!
lousy big shot. thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
marge kicked me out.
pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. i tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children. how am i supposed to last five days without shooting something?
yeah.
former president. potentially dangerous?
woo hoo!
i thought smithers did it.
tv said that? but i have to have a gun. it's in the constitution.
you couldn't be more wrong, lisa. if i didn't have this gun, the king of england could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. do you want that? huh? do you?
all right, then.
a gun is not a weapon, marge. it's a tool. like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. you just need more education on the subject. tell you what: you come with me to an nra meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more.
learnin' somethin', marge?
hi. it seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. so if you'll have me, i would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!
oh, come on, be fair marge. for once in your life, be fair.
what? oh apu, i would never... or would i? i'll do it! i'll rob the kwik-e-mart.
see you in hell, dinner plate.
mmm, you probably left them at work. on another topic, guess who was picked to host the next nra get-together?
you said the breakfast table.
listen, if it'll make you feel any better, i'll put the safety on. oops, guess it already was on. uh. i'd better just put it down.
and i'm a wonderful man.
oh, i see bart gets to have a gun.
i put it in a safe place, marge. i mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?
but marge, i swear to you, i never thought you'd find out!
here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies. anyone else want a beer?
i use it for everything! watch me turn on the tv.
yeah, but...
i didn't get one yet.
sorry.
oh, marge, there's so many things i want to yell to you!
o-kay!
it's gone for good, marge. i finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?
i know i said that, but what i secretly meant was...
the joke's on you, buddy. there's no bullets in that thing.
okay, don't shoot!
i'm sorry i lied to you, marge. but this gun had a hold on me. i felt this incredible surge of power, like god must feel when he's holding a gun. so please, get rid of it, because i know i'll just lie to you again and again!
you're a disgrace to this family.
there you go, bart, pee wee football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches.
then it's settled.
hey, flanders. you're the worst coach this team has ever had.
fun, too.
ahh, you got lucky, flanders! and fix that hat!
huh, big deal. i've been carried out of moe's like that hundreds of times.
yes, roy.
flaaaan-ders...
game's out there! made you look...
i know, sweetie, and i got him right in the... uh-oh. hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, flanders. go wildcats!
no, no. no, no, no. it's just that, well, like i was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you.
then why are you running the obstacle course?
you never use it.
wipe that smile off your face.
i'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. from now on, i'm gonna work you like a dog. now go fetch me twenty laps.
well, if you know a better way for me to live through my son, i'd like to hear it. i knew it. slowing down already, huh?
my father never believed in me. well, i'm not gonna make the same mistake. from now on i'm gonna be kinder to my son, and meaner to my dad.
now just because i'm his father, he'll get no special treatment. he calls me "coach" just like everyone else. which he'll be doing... as our new starting quarterback!
what is it, sweetie?
son, you can do anything you want. i have total faith in you.
since your mother yelled at me. now how 'bout that hug?
not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, flanders?
it's okay, son. you'll do better next time.
oh, really? do reeky players get the game ball? hey, everybody! let's hear it for bart!
ohh, your mother's not pregnant, is she?
ohh, boy. well, i'll just have to go to my back up plan... nelson, how's your arm feelin'?
good, take this note over to the referee.
don't listen to them, son. i have total faith in you.
what? well, i got news for you, mister. you can't quit! you're cut! you too, milhouse.
oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too.
i didn't raise him to be a quitter, marge. it must have been you. you've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler...
mr. burns, this is homer j. simpson, the father of the big quitter. well, i just wanted to tell you i'm a big quitter, too, and i quit!
so...
we're in the championship. way to go, team!
well, bart, looks like it's just you and... ohhh.
oh. well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of skittles. hello, son. i wanna apologize. i just got so caught up trying to encourage you, i was blinded to your stinky performance. if you forgive me, i promise i'll never encourage you again. i've got lots of quarters.
aww... you know, tomorrow's the championship game and i could sure use a good offensive tackle.
consider him cut.
hold on, i'm workin' it out. okay. half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, nelson, you just spin around in a circle.
are you sure, son? i knew i could count on you.
scully, you're cut. ehhh, brooks, groening, simon, you're all cut. castellaneta, gone. kavner, cut. cartwright, cut. smith, sorry, cut. azaria and shearer, you're cut. firestone, you're cut. so is judge. namath, you stay. all of those people are cut. phil, schultz and wolf and silverman. goldreyer, o'brien, dolye, selman. i don't know what... i don't know what you're doin' here, 'cause you're all cut. pietila, clan..., kuwahaha... there're so many cuts here look, i'll just post 'em up and you just see where your name is. oooo, look at how many cuts there are there. ohhh, boy, you're cut. all of you. he's cut, i cut you! you're cut too, shooshie!
yeah, why don't we buy 'em mink stoles while we're at it?
i understand. yoink. wow...
ooo, let's see what she wrote!
oh. well, congratulations.
not... really...
o-kay, here we go...
then just tell her you're already married.
then get married. what the hell do you want from me?!
loser. loser. loser. five... hundred.... dollars! apu wake up! i want to buy a yodel and this lottery ticket. i have this much.
oh... oh... ooo... oh... yodel. late night, huh?
what's the big problem?
then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
okay... seems to me , what you oughta do is, um...
wellll, you could always move into my house, and tell your mom that marge is your wife.
please? it's just for as long as his mother's living here.
can you feel the love?
okay, gotta run. apu, i'm sure you wanna to get upstairs and fix that broken toilet before marge yells at you again.
oh, right. with the giant heads.
oh, no, i'm not... oh, well, let's see whatcha got here.
supper at 4 o'clock? oh-ho, what a sweet deal! hey! they got chairs with wheels, and here i am using my legs like a sucker!
oh, no you don't.
eat my dust!
please. also, i think i'm getting a bedsore. what do you have to do to get turned around here? hey, what's lucky hooked up to?
and here i am using my own lungs like a sucker! and how come everyone gets a bedpan and i have to walk all the way over there?
yeah!
ohhh, right, right. the fake marriage thing. how's that goin'?
you could fake your own death...
all you need is a car bomb and...
moe, what do you recommend for severe depression?
actually, it's more like twelve. no, i'm so stupid, seven. it's seven hours. you have seven hours. see? seven.
nah, just your screwy country.
don't worry, apu. some day you'll meet someone you really love.
gods, eh?
screw him. put me down! ganesh commands you! oh-ho-ho-ho!
that doesn't matter. the important thing is we won.
sheesh! you're the most paranoid family i've ever been affiliated with.
woo hoo! howdy, gents! i'm here to collect my free-- ow! ow! my boating arm! what's going on?
lousy cops. lucky for you i'm double-parked or i'd... there. now, can i please have my motorboat?
because... the thingee was... shut up.
fossils shmossils. you can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. bones shmones.
lemme through! i got here late!
now that's interesting.
i'm locking it up in my safe deposit closet with my other valuables. i'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
pfft. that's what they said about this billy beer, smartypants. ahh. we elected the wrong carter.
sounds like goood watchin'.
get your own angel, ya moocher.
a buck, eh? that gives me an idea... fifty cents, please.
no one's calling it an angel, lisa. if you'll look carefully, you'll notice i never once used the word "angel".
that's a typo.
oh, no. oh, no. we could lose out on bags and bags of money. it's sacrilegious, i tell ya.
okay, folks. get your angel glow sticks! no one gets into heaven without a glow stick!
somebody stop her!
oh-ho, no! this can't be happening! what the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?
you damn well better! okay, okay, don't panic. marge, stop panicking. we need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. bart! strip down to your skeleton!
oh angel, listen not to this child of satan.
oh, marge, don't let go, no matter what. if they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too.
work! ahh, i love these real saturdays. they're so relaxing. not like that fake saturday that almost got me fired.
absolutely.
we do?
oh, that. ah.
pfft. friends of the library?
i went yesterday.
well, i bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!
woo hoo!
i don't recall being consulted when you bought that hat.
then what are you complaining about? you got yours. mm-hm-hm.
you're the boss.
okay-bye-love-you.
oh, yeah. i'm a real expert.
you betcha.
oh yeah.
i see.
i don't know, marge. trying is the first step toward failure.
you're all nuts.
i like being thanked.
seat belts?! pfft! they kill more people than they save.
gee, that picture makes your butt look big.
lumber. we need lumber.
come on... you... stupid... car... you... get... goin'...
yeah, honey. even if you don't succeed in the business world, you're still the world's greatest wife and mother.
kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. why don't we let her clear the table in peace?
man, the air feels good on my neck! ooo, gumball.
it was just an expression.
that old flanders place gives me the creeps.
this is my car! and i'm not fat, it's glandular!
you're...
...down...
...punk!
yeah, you're right.
oh. oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap.
you know me, marge. i crave the hustle and bustle.
oh, santa's got a little trick up his sleeve. attention, shoppers. register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience. sorry, these are for display only... this has been recalled... oo, bart would like this... we're out of these...
register 9 is now closed.
what the-- where's christmas? lisa, where's christmas?
well, there's no easy way to say it, kids: god hates us.
okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy.
oh yeah? we'll show 'em. come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis.
that's not as fun as it looks.
you take that back, barney!
stay out of this, old man.
aw, that's my girl. i love you, marjorie.
you shut up.
wow, this really restores your faith in... lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!
thanks, ted.
marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!
what a deal! i'd be a sucker not to get it.
don't worry, honey. i know exactly what i'm -- oopsie.
shut up! one at a time! lisa?
i knew this would happen.
lisa, no! your hands are too weak!
yes, kent. "hello, jerk. we may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. but one thing's for sure: you do exist."
oh, it's true! we weren't robbed! that part we made up! but the rest is true!
well, the boy told us. but that was after we filed a phony police report.
head of the line! a family could get used to being shunned. huh? huh?
there's only one way out. we've gotta give this greedy town its money back.
what the hell's goin' on?
maybe so. but there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. this washcloth.
the hell it is! gimme that! / uh, gimme that! / no! / let go! / gimme that my washcloth! / i want it!
go! oh, i got it! oh, it's just a thread! it was... she's got... she's got the washcloth!
well, they put us on the "waiting to exhale waiting list." but they said don't hold your breath.
whoa. whoa. calm down, little lady--take it easy--take it easy. no.
something very close, exactly along those lines--a clint eastwood - lee marvin shoot 'em up western!
they're singing! they're singing, marge! why aren't they killing each other?
wait, wait, wait. here comes lee marvin. thank god. he's always drunk and violent.
singing is the lowest form of communication.
no i don't, i hate to rhyme.
i wouldn't / i couldn't / i hate that stuff!
and their damp-trousered pa.
see? all this singing scared him away / if we just talked like normal, he'd probably stay.
okay.
even the criminals are beginning to croon.
all right marge, you've convinced me, there are more terrible things / than musical comedies where everyone sings.
and not a moment too soon.
the experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how.
ice-cream-man-ice cream-man!
it's carnival time! here's money, kids! take what you need!
ding! ding! ding! ding!
heart condition? get outta here.
he's not just some "guy," marge. he's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. carnies built this country. the carnival part of it, anyway. and though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men.
yes, sir!
do do do do do...
who, me?
a novelty comb! kings among men...
hey, come on! he doesn't have any money. look at his clothes.
hey, that's not fair! i wanna be a carny, too! can i, mister? huh? can i? please?
sure, anything you want.
hmm... yeah, he's telling the truth. thanks for the food, mister...
yes, sir!
fry up some cheese?
please, folks. hold your fire. the water level is dangerously low. oh! oh-ho-ho-ho! ow! my leg!
do i like chicken?
i guess not.
buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world.
oh, we'll see about that. gimme ten rings.
gimme ten rings.
hey, there's a sucker.
yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems.
and how...
not right now, son. daddy's talking to a policeman.
no. he's bart.
okay.
it's a ring toss game.
can't you stay in the whack-a-mole game?
look at 'em, bart. if a carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to anyone.
yes, but first there's a little matter of the carny code. cooder, spud. get off that hog. you're coming to stay at our house.
oh, it won't be long. once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. the older one can pull out his left eye.
cooder! what have you done to our house?
you can't do this to me. what about the carny code?
thank you so much. honey, daddy's waiting for the detective.
listen to 'em, watching my television, sittin' on my couch... you better not be in my ass-groove!
stupid gravity.
i've got it!
aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. they're the cleverest folk in the world. just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. that's it! fire! or...
one game of ring toss. if i can throw this hula hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. if i miss, i'll sign the deed over to you.
now!
yeah, i guess your old man is smarter than you thought. look at 'em standing out there. no place to go. heh, heh. poor guys. hey, what if we let 'em stay here for just a few days?
my groove! they mushed it all out of shape. all right, better put on a pot of coffee, marge. this could take a while. come on now, just a little more. little more to the left... to the left there. what did he do this thing? almost... ahhhhhhhhh
i always say, a boy can learn more at an airport than he can at any school.
right. that'll work.
hmm. makes sense.
how much is this free resort weekend?
and when is this weekend?
i see. and when is it?
and what are you charging for this free weekend?
it's free, right?
marge, marge, marge. remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?
yes. i am the highly suggestible type.

wow, a free movie. thanks! outta my way, jerk ass. whoa, you've got my number on that one, buddy! this is a smart group.
wait - i'm confused about the movie. so the cops knew that internal affairs was setting them up?
well, you see, when i get bored, i make up my own movie. i have a very short attention span.
ooh, look a bird.
uh yeah, i guess i could lose a few pounds. and i can be kind of thick sometimes.
you gonna finish that, bony?
na na na na na na na na leader / na na na na na na na na leader / lea-der, lea-der, lea-der! batman! / i mean, leader! i love the leader! act ii
come again, marge?
i've joined the movementarians! and so have all of you!
marge, when i join an underground cult, i expect a little support from my family.
i have not been brainwashed. kill the girl. kill the girl.
what? what did i say?
and it didn't cost us a dime.
that's a negatory, good buddy!
oh boy! we get to see the leader pass by.
yes, it would be nice if he'd buy american, but what are ya gonna do?
i've never been so happy.
what an honor! we've been called into the presence of --
the leader knows all and sees all.
and he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
beer?
i'm glad i'm back! because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, i was born again!
now i can show all of you what i've come to realize. the reason we're not allowed in the forbidden barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! he's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
whoops.
yeah. he's my favorite fictional character.
quiet. god looks like he has something important to say.
i can't make it in today, mr. smithers. i have smallpox... well, it wasn't wiped out in my house.
you liar. you don't have a home business. why would you make up a lie like that?
internet, eh?
maude, eh?
no time to answer that, marge. i'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise.
ever heard of a little thing called the internet?
oh yeah, everybody's making money off the internet except us. we've fallen behind. way behind.
uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. that's why i need a name that's cutting edge, like cutco... or edgecom... interslice... come on, marge -- you're good at these. help me out.
fine. it's not important. what really matters is my title. i think i'll make myself vice president. no, wait... junior vice president. compuglobal hypermeganet. junior vice president homer simpson speaking. how may i direct your call? it's patty.
can i have some money now?
bill gates? billionaire computer nerd bill gates? oh my god, oh my god! get out of sight, marge! i don't want this to look like a two-bit operation!
get a load of the bowl job, marge.
this is it, marge. i poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! we're rich! richer than astronauts!
oh, right. i reluctantly accept your proposal.
hey, what the hell's going on?!
well, well, well... if it isn't professor know-it-all. 'scuse me, marge.
that's where you're wrong, pal! it's not enough to want a cracker. you have to earn it!
why, yes. yes i do.
a rest home for pirates?
i don't get it.
i still don't get it.
oh i get it. i get jokes.
yes! yes! oh, god yes!
oooh! oh! krusty!
booo!
i also have to go. booo!
i'll cover ya, honey.
impeach churchill!
take that, you greedy fat cats. marge, gimme your purse.
you too, bart.
you didn't have to tell it like it is, marge.
don't you hate pants?
hey, i thought your mother told you to take a bath.
aw, i understand, kids. i'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man.
don't worry. daddy'll fix it. hmmm. outta my way! she's gonna blow!
whatever happened to your mail order bride?
so her career got in the way.
now, now, i won't hear of it, moe. you're a fabulous catch.
oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. but that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town.
okay, i won't lie to you. a lot of people saw that. but you gotta keep tryin'.
hey, don't give up, moe. the girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar.
let's get out of here, moe. this is goin' nowhere.
stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
oh, yeah, i got that.
aw, come on, moe. think of all you have to offer besides money.
if you really need money, you could sell a kidney, or maybe even your car.
steal? oh no, you got the wrong guy. you dropped somethin'.
i'll do it!
mmmm... me.
what about the cops?
so, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?
why all the pearls? why all the hair? why anything?
no, you look a little nervous, lisa.
no. i'm just going out to commit certain deeds. suckers.
that's what you get for not hailing to the chimp.
oh. oh. oh. oh! great! listen, i know it looks bad. but all i can tell you is i destroyed that car for all the right reasons.
that's my girl. you just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. moe will take care of everything.
aw, thanks, boy. i'll give you two packs for that candy bar.
why you little...
but i'm in jail.
moe, you gotta get me outta here. tell the cops i didn't steal the car. say you lent it to me.
but moe, we're best friends...
hurry, moe. at three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. the exercise yard!
hawaii? what about hawaii? moe? who's going to hawaii? am i going to hawaii?
let me out! i'm innocent! i changed my mind, i don't want to be in here anymore!
hmm... this could be useful...
oh-ho, i'll help you. help you die!
ohh, i could never stay mad at you, moe. after all, you get me drunk.
aw, moe, moe, moe, dry those beady little eyes. your buddy homer'll get you back on your feet.
woo hoo!
um, i'm looking for something in an after-dinner burrito.
well, why would i want to look at a pen with a... oh no, her clothes are coming off! heh, heh. hey, you know who would love this? men. five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!
hey, hey look, a freezer man!
i have frozen myself so i may live to see the wonders of the future. thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. p.s. please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
room for one more...
bo-ring!
c'mon, lisa, join the family!
what way, angel pie?
fine, she doesn't get her skin!
moochin' war widows...
that's a good idea. let's go out for some frosty swirls.
we'll tape it!
pff... "simpson gene!" somebody's got to set that girl straight. and i know how to do it. marge, get me your address book, four beers, and my conversation hat.
okay. uh, this is your second cousin stanley.
everybody hates birds! ...right! well uh, you look pretty successful.
what about you?
oh, lisa's right. we're nothing but a big bunch of losers. show's over, folks. go home.
fine, fine. what do you do... "dr. simpson"?
oh well, thanks, honey. remember, there's nothing that says you can't be a simpson and a success.
yes, son. a spectacular failure.
yeah. good things don't end with "eum." they end with "mania"... or "teria." will there be beer?
i'm gonna try the sex education computer!
then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. but we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. oh yeah, and my other friend was already there.
woo hoo! beer, beer, beer!
uh-oh.
"da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da." "after the beep."
you're the man, ralph!
uh, maybe.
yep, i earned it. mmmm, donuts.
success!
it's my first day.
it's my first day.
ooh, funky.
would you be proud of me?
then i'll do it!
there's a question that's crossed out.
well, i think i can make it out. "are you a homosex..."
nice fella. i wonder if he's gay?
not to worry, honey. we live in a highly technological age, where fighting a war is as simple as turning off a light.
sorry, can't hear you, marge. i'm clapping.
gee, thanks guys. this is just like "the deer hunter."
no.
oh, he did, did he? i'll show him! i'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!
but only if you're good. even if you're not.
uh, a seagull took my sailor hat.
maybe you would like me if you got to know me.
well, i'm no margaret cho, but i do a pretty fair columbo impression. ah, one more thing - one- i should get a glass of water.
ulll.....
marge!
then i'll whomp him with my hat.
bart!
get back here, boy! you're a disgrace to this family and its proud naval tradition!
i always thought lisa would be the one to get her ears pierced.
nu-cue-lar. it's pronounced nu-cue-lar.
oh, lisa, it's just war games. it's not like a game could hurt me. damn you, rock'em sock'em robots! can't we all just get along?
we have orders not to fire on anybody but greenpeace. well, i guess that's everyone. except earring-boy.
well, when i was ten i got my ear pierced but this is completely different!
what's a jib?
thank you.
i want peas.
uh-huh.
and you're like the father i never visit.
me?
i'unno.
hmm. what would the captain say in my spot?
all right, all right, mellow out, everybody. the captain'll know what to do.
i am?
very well then. i'm a captain. mr. moe -- steady as she goes!
enough of what's out! what's in?
don't worry, i've been working on it. hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two... all right. i can't waste any more time. people's lives are depending on me. mr. sulu -- make a left!
that's it. left. left. steady as she goes. on second thought, go right.
you mean water?
i guess that's it. ladies and gentlemen... we're in a tough spot and i don't know if we're gonna get out. please remain calm and think of your loved ones.
i'll plug your hole. i mean, eureka!
mr. moe, prepare to surface.
uhhh... it's my first day! es mi dia primero. wuo gang kai shuchun gong chuo quack quack quack.
woo hoo!
well, i couldn't have done it without bart. boy, i guess i was wrong about that earring. it saved us all.
i don't think so, son.
no.
ask your mother.
maybe for christmas.
oh, will this horrible year never end?
what is it, sweetie? did you see a scary picture in your picture book?
no, because... you see i went ahead and... year-wise, i was counting forward from the last previous...
shutup! shutup! if i don't hear you, it's not illegal. okay, i need some deductions! deductions! ah! business gifts! here you go. keep using nuclear power.
okay, marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, lisa's a clergyman, maggie is seven people and bart was wounded in vietnam...
well...
help! somebody!
no sir, please. i can't go to prison. they pee in a cup and throw it on ya. i saw it in a movie!
no, please, i'll do anything!
i'm very happy to meet you.
okay, but could you pay me under the table? i got a little tax problem.
quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. it goes all the way to the president.
does this make me look fat?
but not fat.
how 'bout you, lenny? testing, testing? lenny?
uhhhh, like those. but involving you.
barney? that was me! and i'd do it again.
oh, that's ridiculous, moe. end transmission.
well, i'm just glad it's all over.
walk? that wasn't part of the deal.
losers...
ooh! a trillion-dollar bill? 'atsa spicy meatball!
i'm in.
uhh, i don't know what to tell you.
well, mr. burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside...
still cold.
starting search for trillion-dollar bill. c'mon... where are you?... here, trilly, trilly.
uh, yeah, sure. that thing.
no you don't. heh, heh.
ewww!
is that a fish?
is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
wowww, that must be worth a fortune.
hey, he's right...
i'm gonna write the best darn article... oh wait. take that, uncle sam!
ohh, we're never gonna make it. let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways.
but i can't leave the country! what about my wife and kids?
we'd better do what he says.
woo hoo! we can gamble! yes!
nice to meet you.
i had no idea.
mr. burns, i think we can trust the president of cuba.
god bless america!
do they do any other tricks?
just the monkey then.
oh-ho-ho, i'm not handicapped. i'm just lazy.
enfeebled?! oo, i know just the guy! be right back.
relax. it's only mojo. mojo, marge. marge, mojo. he can do anything you show him. watch. simpson residence.
this "filthy monkey" made the orange juice you're drinking.
marge! the kids are on!
honey, he's clearly marked his territory.
can he get a duck?
and so on.
no, no. he's fine. go on, mojo, show marge your happy dance.
lisa, don't you ruin another love day.
i guess.
kiss it.
oh-ho yeahhh...
yes, but the memories will last a lifetime. crap -- py -- stuff.
ooh, but i can rebuild!
i don't know. a lot of people were yelling stuff.
that was yesterday, moron!
hey, i'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbage men.
no room for you, jell-o.
sorry ned. i didn't see you down there. got him.
then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits diaper hill.
so-ho, the rats seem happy.
yeah, but i'm always secretly disappointed when you do. anyway, i think those garbage men are starting to crack.
apologize for that remark.
attaboy!
you signed my name? i feel so violated.
perfect.
don't come off all high and mighty with me, patterson. you can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp.
oh, oh, oh, i get it. put on a big show for the cameras.
i came to fight city hall. i wanna shake things up, patterson. stir up some controversy. rattle a few cages.
never!
you want to know what i think?
well, we'll see about that.
why you little... no one's gonna beat ya, son. you're gonna get such a beating.
these old geezers just don't get it. it's time to rock the vote.
potato man.
take a hike, kojak.
quiet, you! i know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. but i also know you care about the race for sanitation commissioner. so, let me give ya the 911...
can't someone else do it?
it is?
woo hoo!
can't someone else do it?
aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
well then... well then, can't someone else do it?
and can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?
well, ray patterson thinks you should do it! animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. did we lose a war? that's not america. that's not even mexico. don't you deserve better than the best?
well, then you shoulda been early.
not if we hire more men. and my men will do all your messy jobs. they'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables...
well, then you'd better turn up your hearing aid, pops.
do we want old man patterson here with his finger on the button?
woo hoo!
fifty cents? not likely.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ray. are we gonna let politics get in the way of our friendship?
yeah, that was just a lie.
yes, i gotta work hard, honey. daddy made a lot of crazy promises.
oh, the garbage man can, marge. the garbage man can.
oh no! wait, i think i've got the perfect solution.
they let me sign checks with a stamp, marge. a stamp!
will cash be okay?
close, but you're way off.
marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.
sure i can, honey-kitten.
nay!
come to what?
yeah, it's somethin', all right.
yeah, but whaddaya gonna do? if you need me, i'll be at moe's. hi moe.
what? they had a picnic last week.
if god didn't want us to eat in church, he would have made gluttony a sin.
ooo, still plenty of parking.
yeah, out of the way, whoever you are. you're blocking the food.
flanders is playing? why didn't you say so?
i agree. let's surrender.
hmm... all right, but don't lose them. they're my only pair.
stupid kids...
oh, stop it!
yeah, well, i've humiliated my son for the last time. i'm going to get into shape.
no, i mean it. i'm really serious this time.
uhh... don't you have anything healthy here?
hmm... a bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. wow.
ranier wolfcastle! oh, i love your movies and your power sauce bars and your taut, rippling--
wow, wolfie. two months ago i didn't know what the word "dumbbell" meant. this place is great.
i have been working out secretly at night. and look at me now!
no, here. try my foot. no, not that foot. just feel my biceps.
well, whaddaya think of your old man now, son?
look at you people. bart's a tub, lisa's weak as a little girl, and maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all.
you too, marge. if you toned up a little, you'd probably get a lot more action.
yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone.
overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on.
huh?
i am?
if you're trying to scare me, it won't work. i'm one hundred percent focused on my goal. hey, my hat has ear flaps!
that's right, brad and neil. i only eat power sauce -- the bar with apple-saucicity.
well, yeah...
bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal i have ever faced.
shut up. you are so fired.
the hell i won't. you're forgetting i've got my power sauce bars.
forget it. i'll be at the top by noon. over and out.
oh, marge, i never thought you'd see me again.
aw, dammit!
thanks, bart. that makes it all worthwhile.
'mornin', barney.
huh? whuh? hyuwhuh? i'm awake! i'm awake! i'm a productive member of the team! you can't fire me, i quit! please, i have a family! well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer. eh. eh. aha. there's some glue.
museum? i don't like the sound of that. what did your mother say?
hmm. so you want to take the bus, huh? i don't know. that's a pretty big decision...
two hundred dollars?! isn't there any other way?
frankly, i do. i know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. i'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus.
my daughter's at that egyptian dealy right now. she wanted to take a limo, but i made her take the bus.
mmmaybe... but you don't know lisa. i mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire.
uh, yesss... but now i have to leave on a totally unrelated matter. lisa!
keep it moving, marge. this isn't a parking lot.
excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?
lisa? lisa? lisa!
stay there! i'll come down and save you! lisa! save me!
oh, no! i'm gonna go off the end of the --
nah, i'll just walk it off.
don't ever say that.
if i hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker, i never would have found you.
stupid risks are what make life worth living. now your mother, she's the steady type, and that's fine in small doses. but me, i'm a risk taker. and that's why i have so many adventures.
i'm enjoying my life too much to care. and you should be too. so what would you like to do right now, more than anything in the world?!
closed, eh? so getting in would be a pretty big risk. what do you say, honey? feeling stupid? i know i am.
good. you're gonna need that adrenaline to make the final jump.
could you open the window? the cops have daddy's prints on file.
well, daddy will figure it out.
lisa, you can't go this far and then not go further.
oh, so now it's we, eh.
anytime, honey. just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. now let's get home before your mother kills us.
it is? well... that's a good song too. do do do do-do do do...
run!
oh, happy anniversary, marge. hey, look what was in here. a program from that guy's funeral.
yeah, him. whatever happened to that guy?
you mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? why was i not informed?
hey marge, wouldn't it be weird if they had little parties at night? wee little parties?
gotcha! another super year with a super lady. good night, honey.
you know, um, it is a special occasion...
oh. no. no, i'm the guy. i'm supposed to, uh...
i know, but let me get you started first.
oh, sorry.
ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
i know, but i don't like it. ahh!
he's the best boy!
hey, marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?
i love that dog.
what? the food! why did this happen? whyyyyyy?
okay. it was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. plus i'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than i let on.
eh, i never thought i'd live this long.
i'll get us out of this, honey. it's just gonna take a whole lot of floorin'. hmmm...
that was close!
at your service, milady. cara mia...
sorry, guys. marge and i are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast.
nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all.
um, no time like the present.
well, yeah, kinda... did that butter churn just move? 'cause if it did...
mine too. just like back in that hay loft.
there's the dirty girl i married. come on, i have a disgusting idea.
hello, everybody.
bart! yes.
awww... eskimo kiss!
i don't think anything i've ever done is wrong.
yeah, i thought bart would be born a dimwit.
well, this time i'm drunk on love... and beer.
oh, why can't they just play through?
ohh, why are people always trying to kill me?
oh, we're surrounded, marge. maybe we should give ourselves up.
yeah, the british tabloids will have a field day. there's only one thing left to do. grab onto the handles, marge.
these have pleats...
no, that was not the thing.
marge, uh, can we not land here?... honey?... baby doll...?
dads especially!
scary ways. but we never intended it to end like that. with thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.
who's in the mood for miniature golf?
hey, this hot dog tastes different.
uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus.
people buy grease?
used grease is worth money? then my arteries are clogged with yellow gold. i'm rich, apu! rich, i--! money in the bank.
marge, if you don't mind, i'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence.
no, through savings and wise investments. of course with grease!
where do you think you're goin'?
not for you it isn't. you're in the grease business now.
yeah, but your mom paid for that.
and i get my money from grease. what's the problem? wow, look at that load of grease. boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.
oh, you'll miss plenty. i have a feeling this business is going to consume our whole lives.
li-sa, i can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. but apparently this new girl is. so my advice would be to start copying her in every way.
oh i'll say. look at that redheaded kid. there must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
all right. we'll try it your way.
my god, you're greasy.
if she didn't want her car ruined, she should've done a better job hiding her keys. hey, what the...? hey, hey, you're taking our grease!
oh, what's the point?
wait a minute. the boy's right! i can't quit now. aww, you always know just what to say to cheer me up. emu farm... you're priceless, marge.
all right, screw it. let's roll. mmm... i knew i should have attached those somehow.
okay, turn on the suction. it's not working.
oh, yeah. well, here goes... and now we wait. so... is this your school?
uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... scotland.
uhh... north... kilt... town?
wait a minute, there's no angus maccloud in north kilt-town. why you're not from scotland at all!
bart, please. the groundskeeper and i are trying to settle this like adults.
that's my grease! it's mine! give it here!
seventy-six point two?! but i'm already thirty-eight point one! i've wasted half my life!
what are you talking about, marge? i don't need a... okay, send the truck.
marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for lenny.
oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that. i've wasted half my life, marge. do you know how many memories i have? three! standing in line for a movie, having a key made, and sitting here talking to you. thirty-eight years and that's all i have to show for it.
cold.
oh. i see you're having a party. i'll come back later.
all we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage mir.
no.
hike.
stupid movies. who invented these dumb things anyway? was it you, bart?
really? a restaurant? well, now i don't know what to think.
cut it out, boy!
reading about this edison character. they won't let me in the big people library downtown. there was some unpleasantness. i can never go back. ooh, look at all the inventions edison came up with. the stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. and look at him dance. de de de de de.
and these hardy boys books are great, too. this one is about smugglers.
i think it's pretty obvious that i am. go school!
not the way i quit. ooh-who.
well, i remember where edison worked. it was menlo park. that's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and...
that's boring. you're boring everybody. quit boring everyone!
marge, that's it! that's why i haven't done anything with my life! i need to be more like thomas edison!
and i'm starting right now. no more lousy pajamas! from this day forward, i am an inventor!
well, i quit my job just like you said to.
yes, you did. i remember your exact words. you said i should quit my job and become an inventor or you'd torch the house.
you look at this table and what do you see? just a table. now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables.
my files! uh, this isn't working. i've got to try a different approach.
yes. thomas edison smoked several cigars a day.
shutup.
uh-huh. a-- wait a minute! these aren't exciting new products! you're not even trying. okay, that's it. both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves.
i don't see why not. they're my kids. i own 'em.
ohhh, it's no use. i can't work like this, cut off from the scientific community. you stay here and guard the sandwich.
look, i just want to know how to invent things. tell me.
hamburger earmuffs!
thanks, sucker!
now, here's my "everything's okay" alarm. this will sound every three seconds unless something isn't okay.
it can't be turned off. but it does break easily. now this next one's for the ladies. how many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?
women will like what i tell them to like. now here's something for everyone. in the olden times, if you were watching tv and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. it was the hardest thing in the world to do. but now, with the lazy man reclining toilet chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip.
sure! believe me, every man in america will want to have one.
yes?
yes? yes? yes?
but this is the best i could do. i guess i'm no better at being thomas edison than i was at being homer simpson.
all week, my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison, but now it's over. i guess i'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father.
oh, that. i stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff.
really? you think it's a good idea?
i thought i had a great idea, but i must've seen it on this poster.
it's not? maybe he never told anyone about it. that chair might be the only one he made.
so, we've got to go to the edison museum and smash it! then i'll be an inventor!
aw, to hell with him!
oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like thomas edison, jr. you know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. oh, and later, he raised turkeys. that was on his turkey farm.
now let's take care of business. outta the way. this is one invention you're not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!
invent your way out of this, edison. look, son. edison was just like me.
no! we both lived in another man's shadow. this old-timey nerd and i have suffered the same frustration and heartache. we're not rivals. we're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. i can't destroy your work, my friend.
oh. well then, we'll take it out on eli whitney.
that's my tommy.
let's just say i'm sitting in the right chair.
well, that's it.
yeah, quit stalling, marge. we want our reward.
stand back and watch the pro.
nah. they mess up my hair. ooh. ball one. ball two. this bozo's gonna walk me. hey! you're going down, you-- oh! oh! why you-- hey you-- you better-- i'm gonna-- if you k--
all right. i hate folding sheets.
it's okay, marge. i'll get him. ba-art!
milhouse!
tell bart to come home!
who's nelson?
i'unno. drug lab?
or reading comic books. what am i, kreskin? you tell me what he's doing.
sure it didn't.
ooo, how 'bout cherry this time? and would it kill you to make some coffee? why is this taking so long? bart was born in about five minutes.
i see a horn!
aww... ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur. that is one vicious baby bird.
enough bickering. i know how to settle this.
woo hoo! marge, they found a donor! i'm saved!
later, chickie-pie.
you sent me to the chair.
i know you are, but what am i?
oh, my god!
yoink.
don't worry. i'll protect you... little dude. there. now no murderers can get in... or out.
you are sooo dead.
come here, you little--
but i look so youthful and hunky. the kid's gotta die. but i love my son. more than a lush head of hair? don't make me choose!
i'll show you, hair!
idiot?! why you... little...
it wasn't me, it was the hair!
mama took those batteries / she took 'em away / mama took those batteries / size double a...
huh? oh, okay... let's see... "pause," "three," no "fa-fa"...
ohh... ahh...
i just lost my appetite.
all right. i got it. come on. get... off the... bad baby! oh, she's entering the terrible twos, all right.
hello-- oh, great. mormons.
huh? what are you talking about?
you intergalactic hussy! how could you?! was he better than me?
it made me angry, jerry. angry and tired.
one-eyed, two-timing ! i'm gonna !
c'mon, maggie. let's go home.
oh, i was having the most wonderful dream. i had a hat, and a tie with no pants on.
no, that would make me a great father.
aw, four a.m. now i'll never get back to... "magilla gorilla, gorilla for sale..." hey, you shouldn'ta oughta taken my banana, mr. peebles.
screw this. hang on, everyone. we're takin' the ol' simpson shortcut.
so long, suckers!
i see it.
well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies.
okay, remember where we parked.
oh yeah, couldn't put it down. c'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack.
tow rope?
skier?
here we go!
ooh, look at it go.
higher! bye-bye, fishies! higher! higherrr! i'm soaring! soaring majestically like a candy wrapper caught in an updraft! higher, marge! higher!
higher, i say! i want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! i want to look down on the clouds with contempt! i want to sneer at god's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh.
oh, this is not good. aw, nuts.
sorry, lady. i know you. you're kim basinger
well, i am a married man...
so, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?
wait! tell me over breakfast. who's for pancakes?
oh, i don't want to be a bother. anyway, what are you two big hollywood stars doing in good ol' springfield?
yeah, tell you the truth, i'm not even sure.
okay, fine. but i could do all kinds of stuff for you. i noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken.
please, homer. c'mon, if you let me hang around a while, i can do all kinds of stuff for ya.
yeah, you owe me that much.
i can't read.
i recognized the logo.
nowhere famous.
gersh agency.
chanterelle --
aaand shiitake.
nothing, nothing. i'm just broadening my horizons. uh, by the way, do you have extra-wide bumper stickers for a humvee?
ooo, me-ow. i'll get it! i'll get it! yes?
alec baldwin and kim basinger?!
really? you giant stars consider me a friend? well, for the first time in my life i feel like i'm somebody. ronny, are you also my close friend?
it's called a lawnmower. i invented it. you want one?
sure. we'll all stay.
kent brockman. please.
imagine films.
that's right, force it. whip that neck.
oh, there's that movie script i wrote. where did you find it?
well, he expressed an interest.
did too!
you lie!
so you're saying you don't want to star in my movie?
i might have.
oh, i can't. i promised i wouldn't.
who the hell are you?
all right, i'm gonna let you guys in on something. but you've got to keep it much more secret than i did.
nothing, nothing. good hustle.
uh-oh.
i'm looking at you, horshak.
okay, okay, it was me. i'm sorry i blew your secret. but you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. i just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. reflected glory!
come on, ron, we're not wanted here. all right, i'll go. but the next time you want someone to remind you which brother is which, or smell your hair while you're sleeping, just remember, old homer won't be here anymore.
when kim makes a manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. and would it kill you to put some fennel in it?
oh, it was so great. i didn't have to fake it with them. i was actually excited to hear about their day.
was it the dog from the beethoven movies?
see? it's like we don't even speak the same language anymore. the only one who understands me is that guy who married martha raye.
hmmm... she may not be famous, but she's right. those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. i did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... and i've still got a car full of their crap. crap, eh...?
attention starstruck fools! step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of alec-and-ron-and-kim-arabilia. only 5, no wait 10 dollars. you heard right, 20 dollars.
that's right, mister tough guy can't handle a little penicillin. oh, and look at this. we can't even pay our bills and they're drinking royal crown cola.
ooh, look at me! i'm kim basinger, the big movie star! i'm so beautiful! i think i'm so great! i'm too important to take homer to the oscars.
gotta-go-thank-you-for-supporting-the-museum-of-hollywood-jerks.
no!
oh, god.
yes, i do. i believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. if celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively. in closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. and when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. thank you, your honor.
well, i'll always have my crank calls. hello, old lady from "titanic"? you stink!
all righty, i'll just-- you stinkin' g--
but with college behind us, we'll need careers. and good ones.
oh, am i?
it's the job of tomorrow... today!
well, that settles it. for all those reasons and more, let us choose an electrifying career in... line.
nuclear power.
well, there were script problems from day one.
that was the problem. the important thing is, after all these years of paying my dues, i'm finally getting some decent parts.
i didn't choose to be a gifted actor, marge. it chose me. i'm merely a vessel through which genius flows. now help me make up some phony credits.
good. good.
but i can't ask mom. she's on the run from the law.
no! homer simpson does not lie twice on the same form. he never has and he never will.
yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. the point is, i'm a grown man, and i deserve a middle name.
great. i'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.
you went to woodstock?
lather, rinse, and repeat. always repeat.
wow, i could have lived like that?
ohh, my mother painted that for me? oh, my god! my middle name is right behind that shrub. i'll finally know what "j" stands for! from this moment forth, i will be known as homer...jay simpson. it's so beautiful. what a magical gift for my mother to leave me.
my head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. i'll do it!
i'm gonna be a hippie, just like mom wanted. i'm gonna let my spirit soar and love all of god's creatures! get off, you stupid dog!
bummer... love-in... dean rusk... by george i've got it!
your potato? you can't like own a potato, man. it's one of mother earth's creatures.
why do you have to turn everything into one big plastic hassle? marge, you've got too many hang-ups. like the whole shaving trip. c'mon, i want to see those legs all furry and gross.
c'mon, maude. the human wang is a beautiful thing.
okay, okay. narc.
right on.
work!? but you're hippies!
profits, profits, profits! what kinda hippies are you? peter fonda must be spinning in his grave.
oh, yeah? when's the last time you freaked out the establishment? you guys are total sellouts.
look, we can sit here all day and play the blame game, or we can start freaking people out. c'mon, where's your freak bus?
fine. i guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
now your freak flag's flying! let the freak-out begin! woo hoo! ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. i brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!
hi, marge. we're freaking out squares!
marge. not in front of the hippies.
hear ye! hear ye! the intergalactic jester proclaims this conformity factory closed! woo hoo!
no, no, no. marge was definitely freaked out.
uh. pretty, uh, freaky, huh?
yes, b-b-but the poncho...
perhaps in time.
aww, you're just saying that.
well, i do walk through pretty much anything... ohh, you kids are sweet.
i picked 'em, juiced 'em, and delivered 'em to every store in town. your business is saved!
heh. that's what i thought at first. but then i found the other garden behind the barn -- the one with the camouflage netting.
well, now the whole town can benefit from their nutrients!
not so fast, pig! we're making a stand. a freaky stand! you can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!
look at yourselves, pointing guns at your fellow man. hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on. freedom... love... and peace.
can't you just prune some of the leaves so i can watch tv?
don't make me come up there!
woo hoo!
why? we're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free.
nooo, nothing made of dead guys. what's in the back? hurry up. my hands are getting cold.
ooooh.
hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? oh, i can't afford that. unless...
hold on. i'm still fine-tuning. uh-oh. perfect.
no problem. i picked some up at the store.
nothing's too good for my one and only. eat, eat! you're nothing but skin and bones.
well, i guess this is it, ol' pal. this is your big day.
okay...
but marge, look at the little guy!
feel that, marge? he likes you!
we're not eating mr. pinchy. he's part of the family now. pinchy, i made you some risotto.
aren't you proud of your big sister, mr. pinchy? hmm? hmm?
that's my girl!
wooo!!
sorry, marge. pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. but don't worry. i put him in a nice hot bath.
uh-huh. pinchy would have wanted it this way. my dear, sweet pinchy. no more pain where you are now, boy. oh god, that's tasty. i wish pinchy were here to enjoy this. ohhh, pinchy!
hey, i'm trying to drive here!
uh-oh. tape must have fallen off. there, problem solved.
relax, she just needs a little lovin'.
three minutes?
do we have to listen to you?
i'm done.
hey robot, get your fat, metal ass down here!
duh.
what the heck is this, a tea party? somebody kill somebody!
but it's funny, marge. the guy's sick.
oh, we've gotta get home. i don't wanna miss, "inside the actor's studio." tonight it's f. murray abraham.
can't stop now. we're making great time.
what are you, an animal?
we're almost home, dad. only a couple more times over the horizon.
you just sit back and relax. i'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
excuse me, doctor. i think i know a little something about medicine...
so... you're saying i don't need a new muffler?
oh, i blame myself for this. c'mon, doc. there's gotta be something i can do to help my dad.
a kidney? okay, fine.
well now that's what i always thought, but somehow...
"apes-a-poppin'!" oooh, the airline version!
nothing's too good for me. ahhh. i'm the luckiest man in the world, now that lou gehrig's dead.
it's not an operation, moe. the doctor says it's just a procedure.
procedure. deadly procedure.
now you're just tryin' to scare me.
but i don't want that.
yeah, i guess.
but i don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. why didn't somebody tell me what i was volunteering for? this is everybody's fault but mine.
i owe dad so much. those bedtime stories began my lifelong love affair with the printed word.
you're right, marge. i'll do it. but if i die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?
blow up the hospital.
liability waiver?
yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... i don't usually sign stuff like that.
oh.
i love you, dad.
i've been on that one. the taffy shop.
the name on the back says "honeybunch."
well, actually, you did...
say, who are you guys?
whew.
forget what?
well, back on land, my name was homer simpson. and i guess it is here, too. i promised my dad one of my kidneys, but i chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed.
well, yeah, i know...
no you're not, dad.
boy, that... ow!
i'm sorry i ran off again. oh, i guess dad must be dead by now. when i get better, and after i've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave...
it's a miracle! you recovered! what? what? hey!
yeah, i guess you're right. gimme a hug. i don't need two kidneys. i have everything i need right here... hmmm...
yesss, tickling.
well, i'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial.
well, beats work.
neeerrrds! get out of there! mr. hamill, mr. mayor, come on!
homer simpson -- nerd buster. and i'm gettin' you out of here!
never! follow me. oh, how was i supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?
forget maggie! she's gone!
woo hoo!
i said, "woo hoo."
even during ramadan?
wha?
clear!
look out, marge! cat!
hold it! what's your clearance?
access denied.
hmm, still half an hour till dinner. oh, well...
semi-imported. keep 'em comin'.
oh, honey, don't be so naive. that's how the world works. sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time.
so, how'd you get the nickname "legs"?
oh, get that away from me! kids, i don't want you drinking any more milk. ever.
go nuts.
and to think, i respected you! and defended you! you wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!
his corpse is climbing the building!
you're forgetting, you've got the best bodyguard in the business. now promise, or i'll let you fall to your death.
shake on it? relax, you're in good hands. now come on, i'll pull you up.
ooh, the mafia guy's all mad. oh, what are you gonna do? call your godfather? huh? ooh, godfather. break it down!
oh, don't worry about that, boy. he's already out on bail. well, i'm off to work.
what? there's nothing to worry about. all right, fine. i'll take a cab.
oh, i get it. you're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?
you've gotta snap out of this funk, mayor. i'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters.
do you have a table for the mayor?
okay, mr. burns, fat tony, what's-his-name... fat tony?! all right, fat tony. if it's trouble with quimby you're after--
mayor, fat tony asked me to give you this--
oh no. wait... maybe i didn't do it right.
nooooooooo!!! potatoes are clean. the poison must be in the steak.
i think i saw him in "rent," or "stomp," or "clomp," or some piece of crap.
look out! gimme that knife!
the force?!
oh. oh, fat tony.
really? would you say i was magnetic?
aww...
get out of the way you--
oh, i can explain that. you see...
eat my dust, dust!
aaah, what's the rush? might rain next week.
really? you think i should get it washed?
hey, that's great.
ten dollars?! what is this, a car wash for millionaires?
hey! how did churchy la femme get half price?
senior citizen? flanders? well, we'll see about that.
i wouldn't do that, reverend. you see, "saint flanders" is as crooked as you or me!
did you or did you not use a senior citizen discount card at said car wash?
now i'm not a fancy big-city lawyer...
and you are how old?
geez, flanders. you're 60 years old, and you haven't lived a day in your life.
you got that right. throw on the mesquite, bart!
well, well, well. so flawless flanders needs help from stinky-pants simpson.
welly, welly, welly... mr. clean wants to hang with dirty dingus magee.
wellity, wellity, wellity...
eh, the missus will clean that up.
first of all, i get five dollars a day plus expenses.
and i'll need your signature... here, here, aaannnnd... initial here.
well that's unfortunate. it really is.
one day soon i will come for you, and then the game will begin. could be in the middle of the night. it could be when you least expect it. or whatever's good for you. i don't care.
gimme that! that's your problem. you're living up here. you gotta live down here. in the impulse zone. if you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. like this. we're going to break the bank at the monty burns casino!
oh yeah, right. then we're goin' to las vegas! which is actually back in that direction.
relax, i called her from the gas station.
i don't think so. i think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
he's a daredevil, ned. he laughs at death.
ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! pick him!
fine, i'll do it. where do you want me?
bo-ring.
hey flanders, don't spill my beer!
oh, i think someone just had his first taste of blood loss. let's see... what's marge's birthday? barney is july fifteenth, same as lassie's, so marge's must be... fifty... oh, forget it. flanders, what's your birthday?
seven, eh?
one betting disk please. watch and learn.
well, there you go. now how 'bout a drink?
oh, that. that can be treated with our good friend alcohol. you might want to write that down. where the hell's your notebook?
oh, never mind. just pay attention. slave girl? oh, slave girl?
oh, yeah. two more of these, please. and for you, ned?
welcome to my world.
the what now?
well, of course a-- who are you?
ned, no! think of your wives! wait a minute. this could be some kind of scam -- or possibly, scam-ola. we would remember if we got married.
ahh, precious memories.
what did you call me?
sure. sock it to me, baby.
but ginger, honey, i am not the catch i appear to be.
are you sure? oh, rats. no offense, sweetie.
geez, i've never seen anyone so whipped so fast.
i don't know, flanders, having two wives could have its advantages. chop, chop, dig, dig. chop, chop, dig, dig. chop, chop, dig, dig...
oh, those awful women want their omelettes. ginger throws ned a kiss.
the moody blues!
what if we switched wives? would that help?
hel-lo. our ticket to freedom. so long, su--
because we love them, jackass. anyhoo, we came out of walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships...
you're right, you're right. fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. they gang-probed you, while i discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved america.
would you rather tell maude the truth?
well, i only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you. hello, little birdie.
because, i loved them once and they broke my heart. let that be a lesson to you, sweetie: never love anything.
especially me.
i'm going to warm up the car.
and it sucked!
losers.
you'll be in your cold, cold grave before that ever happens.
shut it off. they're losers.
championship? wooooo! 'topes ruuuule!
they lost? those losers!
woo! not over! wooooo!
woo! rumaki!
hey, a baseball field! batter up!
safe!
whoop! careful.
last night? hello, big maggie.
serves you little punks right. maybe next time you'll think befo-- oh, my god! look what those rotten kids did to my car!
well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? acting childish. kidnapping. child abuse...
not until you're older, son.
kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! and they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! so-- oh, right. sorry.
marge, kite.
well, turn something on. i'm starting to think.
bo-ring. go back to that infamy guy.
i have a problem.
well, at least they've already done me.
yeah! / you're only here 'cause marge forgot her pill.
oh yeah? what can you old people do to us?
pfft. it wouldn't have made a difference.
wow, a val-u-qual coupon book! let's see. ten percent off carpet cleaning. ten! two pizzas for the price of one at doughy's.
oh, marge. that's just a trick to get you in there so they can cure your foot pain.
see ya, kids. me and my val-u-qual book are gonna paint the town red... with savings! i'll start with a couple of pizzas, then a complimentary tango lesson and i'll cap it off with a smooth, refreshing colonic.
do you like piña colonics / and getting caught in the rain...
they won't?
really?
oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?
no! wait! this is all my fault! oh, if i could only turn back the clock and buy four new tires...
six with the tip.
hey, i know you. we were in the same pyramid scheme.
yeah. i'm gettin' tired of them pointing and laughing at us.
me? nah. unless there's a coupon for it. nah.
homer simpson at the super bowl?
sorry. it's a deal. hey, moe. wanna come with me and wally to the super bowl?
yeah, they're good. but i wouldn't count out the... denver broncos .
c'mon!...
c'mon!
yes! now that lenny's in, carl will fall like a domino.
yeah, yeah. do we have any pencils that work?
yeah, it's a good group.
aw, thank god! now we can stop holding it in.
hey, troy aikman!
'scuse me, comin' through. friends of dan marino. okay, dan. fire away.
woo hoo! homer simpson with the pick!
uh-oh. lateral, to bart! my spine.
aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. wally and i have all the tickets we need.
stop eating our tickets!
yes, if by "crestfallen" you mean "kill us." listen, let me talk to them. maybe i can smooth this over. my friends...
please, my friends... ow! all right, i'll get you into to the game! excuse me, uh, mr. scalper, sir. have i told you that i love you?
gentlemen, i have an idea. run! woo hoo!
we can still make the kickoff!
oh, we're never gonna get out of... psst, cleaning lady. would you let us out of here?
i didn't ask for your life story. just give me the key.
football!
you guys are following me? i was following flanders.
hit the road, gramps. this is a private sky box.
y'ello...
well, it's about time.
ow! oh! all right, lovejoy! you're gonna get it.
but this might be my last chance to win one.
wally, i'd be lying if i said i hadn't.
phone?
dog, cat?
oh, i can't wait. look, marge, i had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place.
you're thinking of all the other years. this year's shows are classics. there's "the laughter family." that's animated. networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat.
isn't bad? tell me one thing mankind's ever done that's any better.
this is better.
wow. they've captured my personality perfectly. did you see the way daddy caught that bullet?
don't confuse daddy, lisa.
marge, that was debbie pinson. deb-bie pin-son.
local man has same name. a tv character has the same name as springfield resident homer simpson.
and that's the end of that chapter.
all right. and what's the name?
yup. right down to the scarf.
hey, what's going on? that guy's not homer simpson. he's fat and stupid.
no, no, he can't be. i know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. yeah, that's gotta be it.
shutup! i'm not your clown! don't diminish me! gentlemen, i bid you-- who-o-oa! who-o-oa! who-o-oa!
well, i'm sorry to disappoint you gentlemen, but you seem to have me confused with a character in a fictional show. now if you'll excuse me, my fondue is just about...
people are laughing at me, marge. let's get outta here. forget the baby's medicine.
fine. i'll be in the car, driving home.
uh-oh, spaghetti-o's.
and that big yellow flower.
hmmmm, i guess i could... but while i'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there.
yeah. "bart."
it better have.
policecops.
yeah, but why does the homer simpson character have to be so stupid?
i'm begging you. i'm a human being. let me have my dignity back.
then i'd like to legally change my name.
dynamic, isn't it?
that's the way max power is, marge. decisive, uncompromising, and rude.
yes, briefly.
oh honey, they have acids that can burn that off.
and it doesn't stop in the bedroom. oh no, i'm taking charge. kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the max power way.
yeah, but faster.
you remembered my name!
mr. power.
and if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag.
just takin' care of business.
homer sim-- uh, max power.
yeah, isn't it? i got it off a hair dryer.
tie good. you like shirt?
when trent steel bought me some.
he's max power's oldest and dearest friend.
oh, i spit my gum in there.
for all of us. look.
this is our chance to rub elbows with springfield's young, hip power couples... like me and debbie pinson.
get used to it, honey. from now on, we'll be spelling everything with letters.
nah. just park it.
maarrge... president clinton!
me, too. let's sing the cinderella song.
uh-oh. here comes lorne michaels. pretend you don't see him.
anyway, marge. uh, how do you feel about the economy? so i said "if this is the house of pancakes, how come i can't eat the walls?"
hey, no problem.
woo, privilege!
whuh?!
give something back? boo! get a haircut!
hey, stop shoving! i'm max power!
oh, marge. i thought it would be fun to be on springfield's "a" list, but these people are nuts.
sure you can. buncha no-good do-gooders.
that's what i'm saying! see marge, this guy gets it.
no, i just thought it was cute when you called him...
i can't lose them!
eep! leave me alone! go swab begley. he likes it!
i'm free! woo hoo!
yes, i learned you've gotta be yourself. g'night, honey.
oh, i almost forgot. while i was at the courthouse, i had them change your name.
chesty larue.
just try it for two weeks. if you're not completely satisfied, you can be busty st. claire.
sleep tight, hooty.
sh-sh-sh. anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon...
i'm never eatin' chili again. ooh, chili!
door's unlocked.
yeah, i'm going right to the top.
uh-uh, no way. i don't want to miss a word.
i'm picking it up. "sala" seems to mean jerk. and i think "manjula" means some kind of spaceship.
oh, they're newlyweds. they'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'.
oh, she's not gonna leave you right before valentine's day. that'd be like going to an air show and leaving before the plane crash.
sweet mint julep... i'll be at moe's.
goood dog! good doggie! "tax hike approved"? bad dog. bad, bad dog. now to trim away the fat. outlook. "vista." no. "spotlight." "mosaic." nah.
oh, sorry, marge, that's in my stockpile. you can have this.
well, don't just gasp, read it.
i used to take out ads like that when we were newlyweds.
we sold it, didn't we?
yeah, i hate that song.
wouldn't you like to know?
but marge, it's worth it. look, the taco bell dog. yo quiero ta... hey, where'd it go? here boy!
and ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?
will you stop it?! it's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame apu. he's makin' us look bad!
i'unno. gasoline? axes? i got some stuff in the trunk.
let's roll.
not yet, i'm not. you'll know when i'm driving. and it'll...
only till eleven.
oh, baby. we got him now. there's no escape from the airport.
hey, look! it's elton john!
not if i can help it. and help it i might. mr. john. i'm your biggest fan. i've tape recorded all your songs off the radio.
uhhhh. sir elton, my noble friends and i would like to dub you a knight of the... grand concourse.
not so fast, apu!
we're putting an end to your insane valentine's rampage. never again will good, lazy men have to... what the--? oh no you don't!
i am so sick of that damn code!
correction. kill us both.
roses. so many roses.
roses.
well, i think i have a collapsed lung, but okay!
oh, no let me out! let's get outta here! you drive. i eat.
c'mon, mom / flanders, woman! ohhh, you suck, marge.
wow. did you see that thing, marge? so powerful. so commanding. so forceful and raw. it didn't ask, it just took.
hey, a red one! can i buy that? please?
will do!
but that's not for awhile, right?
sweet...
huh?
aw, crap! it's a girl's car. i can't drive this.
are you saying i'm gay? because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it.
fine. sucker.
so... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.
aw, please come in. maggie smells bad. and the cat wants something, but i don't know what.
at least i've got a license.
i've seen plays that were more exciting than this. honest to god. plays. i don't wanna pay four bucks to watch some monkey wannabe lay in the sun.
don't worry, honey. daddy will fix that broken animal.
i'm not gonna hurt him. i'm just gonna wake him up.
ohhh, when will detroit build a sun roof for the husky gentleman?
ah, give me a minute... oh, marge, you saved me!
is there anything that guy doesn't know?
oh, i'm sure of it!
19-- 1939?! oh my god, i've gone back in time! i've got to warn everybody about hitler! and get to the ice cream store!
shut up! you haven't even been born yet.
oh boy, am i glad to see you guys.
woo hoo! let's party!
okay. hey, marge, what's your favorite radio station? well, marge?
what's your favorite radio station?
hey, that's super! see you later.
yeah, but it's twice as much as a deadbeat dad.
we did a lisa thing last month. and i'm glad we did, but now i think we should do something normal people would like.
go ahead, sweetie.
oh, no! ho, ho. i'm not falling for that again. if it doesn't have siamese twins in a jar, it's not a fair.
we're gonna go see marmaduke?
this is all your fault for trading away your turn. just for that, no dessert tonight!
good ol' government.
thank god for grave robbers.
fonzie's jacket!
relax. i'm just boning up on the ol' constitution.
i didn't mean to! look!
wha?!
finally, a company that understands my needs.
it's called caring, marge.
ya gotta admit, marge, that's a lot more roaming.
hey, this is pretty comfortable. that andy capp was onto something.
just pretend it's a tree, honey. or as we say at omnitouch, a progress tree.
nothing. they just needed a place to put all the electronic gizmos, and i know how much you like that sciencey stuff so i...
come on, lisa, try and see this from the omnitouch corporation's point of view.
hm. that thought never occurred to me. funny how your mind works in a crisis.
lisa, what's your favorite movie?
ooh, anything spicy?
great. i'm gonna eat mayonnaise!
well, well, if it isn't frick and frack, jack and jill, fred and ethel, the three...
bart, stop squeaking your chair! if you've got to do something, click this pen.
you're on! lisa, you play winner. oh, honey, you missed a great race. bart was winning, but then he said "this is stupid" and he stopped, and i won!
hey, you're mad at me. that wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?
maybe you'd feel better if we watched some tv together.
no it's not.
awful entertaining.
somebody wants mommy to change baby's diaper.
yes it is.
great. maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.
give it a try, honey.
it's true. i'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em.
oh, no you don't. screw that touchy, queery crap! we'll take the harsh antacids. nothing's too good for my little girl.
sure they are, honey.
nah, you must be thinking of your mother. i'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... can't we just go in? oh good, i've been meaning to buy a "dream catcher?" gimme a break.
other cultures are fine. i'm just saying i can get along in life without a "tooth brush."
and a ooga-booga to you too.
absolutely not. my little girl's tummy hurts. do you have anything to stop her complaining?
oh no. no freezing.
can you pee in it?
me too.
oh, my.
i went on a wild ride without ever leaving the building. how was yours?
like what? whoa, look at that car burn! does it get any better than this?
so i said to that nurse, "you can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."
you better believe i did.
wait. there's a place like that in springfield?! then why are we eating this crap? c'mon, everybody, we're going to the slaughterhouse!
didn't i?
oooh, i'll have that one. and to drink... ... meatballs.
they like me because i'm brave.
greenhorns! who's a greenhorn? what's a greenhorn?
oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. mr. no-belly... mr... hasn't-got-a-belly...
huh? oh, right. the steak.
lousy drunks. i'll show them. what's happening to me? there's still food... but i don't want to eat it. i've become everything i've ever hated.
he called me "greenhorn." i called him tony randall. it was a thing we had.
oh yes he will! and on time, too!
i've got to, honey. i owe it to ol' red, as both his friend and his killer.
don't you have school?
that didn't sound like you meant it.
that's more like it. so long, suckers!
oh, yeah? my left arm says different.
piece o' cake. just need a little truck-driving music.
ohhh. that little punk.
sure thing, gwenn.
aww... that's a nice, friendly gal.
wouldn't it be great to live right here at the truck stop? watching all the people come and go. you could have a different best friend every day.
for now...
it ate everybody. stupid!
relax, boy. we're ahead of schedule.
ten hours?! we gotta roll!
no problem. i'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills.
the what now?
the trucks drive themselves?
well, i'm not really a trucker, so i don't talk to the rep that often.
relax, everybody! the navitron auto-drive system is driving the truck for me! but keep it a secret! it's a big scam! okay?
oh, i shoulda known. they're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity. thank you sir, may i have another?
oh, why do all my trips end like this? eat water, good buddy.
well, well, well. looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy. all right.
red. the trucker. big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?
i'm not red, i'm homer.
ten-four, dead buddy.
well... the last time i saw him, he was in a big plastic bag.
no, but i'm sure the good lord will provide.
thank you.
oh, man. this is the hottest easter ever.
relax, i found it in the dumpster.
looks like god made you out of my sexiest rib.
is there!
don't mind if i do!
no, you're too kind. and wise, and righteous... i can't believe you don't have a girlfriend.
sorry, i already gave him a name. "land monster."
branch monster.
you're pretty uptight for a naked chick. you know what would loosen you up? a little fruit.
and you keep saying we need to do things together...
yeah, just like yesterday.
i gave a rib to eve, and now she's gone forever.
this is my fault. i shoulda stood up for you during that whole "applegate" thing.
don't say that! maybe i can sneak you back in. i mean, god can't be everywhere at once, right?
oh, there, there, i'm sure he's gone to a better place, lord.
hey, now let's not do anything rash... god is love, right?
the pie shall be cut in two. then each man shall receive... death. i'll eat the pie.
eh, it's not the end of the world.
where do you think you're going, missy?
ooh, i smell barbecue! hey, look! oh, they're out of hot dogs! and the cole slaw has pineapple in it! german potato salad!
you throw da can away...
you throw da can away... marge, i'm out of beer.
fine. i'll drop everything i'm doing just for you. but you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my saturday. can you live with that, marge? huh? can ya?
can you?
look pop, i'm planning some expert home repairs, and i need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox.
a man in an apron!
mmmm... hippo...
how 'bout it, bart? would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?
we can all burn evidence in it.
okay, sweetie. daddy'll take over. oh, yeah. that's a fine looking... okay, no big deal... stupid lisa. you gotta build fast! cement drying! all right, let's see... english side ruined! must use french instructions! "le grille?" what the hell is that?! come on... fit you... yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... why doesn't mine look like that?! why?! why must life be so hard? why must i fail in every attempt at masonry?
well, of course. any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. it teaches them while they learn.
but, but...
take the kids out back. i'll handle this.
oh yeah? prove it.
you mean this hunka junk? this isn't art. just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. didn't you? didn't you?! you stupid so...
oh, i got that, lady.
this lady says i'm an artist.
in high school i was voted "most likely to be a mental patient, hillbilly, or chimpanzee!"
lisa, all great artists love free food. check out jasper johns.
woo hoo! look, marge, my first sale! in your face, jasper johns!
i'm gonna be an outsider artist! that way, i can turn all these old baseball cards, disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable.
hey, i've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when i painted portrait after portrait of ringo starr.
good work, honey. keep it comin'.
what do we owe you, moe?
all right.
is it about pies?
good night. you're upset about something. is this about that trip barney and i took to machu picchu?
aw, honey, i've always liked your art. your paintings look like the things they look like.
frankly, i'd be a little turned on.
marge, i've screwed up everything i've ever done. i mean, look at bart. but i finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. and that feels pretty good.
i give you "botched hibachi." the tricycle is on loan from the maggie simpson collection. this piece i call "failed shelving unit with stupid stuck chainsaw and applesauce." and finally, my thing de resistance, "attempted birdhouse i." shall we start the bidding at, say, ten thousand dollars? all right, how about a million?
what's going on here? you weirdos love this stuff.
wait! come back! i'm a god to you! worship me -- or fear my wrath! please fear my wrath, please... call me.
hey, ray j. johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been.
matt groening? what's he doing in a museum? he can barely draw. ow! oh no, i'm being erased!
he must be a hundred feet tall.
it's glorious! the streets are paved with water. you could ride a walrus to work!
mmmm, split-pea. with ham!
ow! hey! no! no! ow! n-no! ow! no, no, andy, no!
marge! why does art hate me? i never did anything to art. oh, let's get out of here.
is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
not the reichstag!
killer umbrellas? of course. exquisite.
big? daring? lisa, that's it! i've got an idea for a wonderful art project that'll make everyone love me again. step one: steal all the doormats in town.
so long, the simpsons!
great. i'll do the pony while you do the lions. make sure you strap 'em on real tight.
people of springfield, behold my latest work!
it's conceptual art -- the grand canals of springfield. just like venice without the black plague. what do you think?
no, i'm just a nut who couldn't build a barbecue. you'll always be the artist in the family.
is that our house?
are we kissing?
shut up, shut up, shut up! well, you said i couldn't do it, but here it is! meet abby the olympic tabby.
just for the prototype, honey. knowing you always hate my first idea, i prepared a backup. how about a big olympic hello for springy, the springfield spring!
it's fun for the whole family. and the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.
they picked springy! in your face, patty and selma!
i've never wanted a beer worse in my life. i love you, honey.
to you, my bubbly, long-necked, beechwood-aged lover.
he says what we're all thinking.
i'llgetit.
woo hoo! my springs! they finally came!
yeah, but i should have no problem selling a thousand springs.
idiots! ooh, these are fun!
boy, moe, you sure look angry. here, have some nuts.
don't answer yet. watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of god's greatest creation, the spring. now, watch this... ow! ohhh...
some second degree burns, but some first class burgers.
but you haven't seen the baby of tomorrow! ta-daa! now if i drop her, no more tears.
you flush one down / it swirls around / nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down...
of course not! "nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."
a hundred and thirty-five springs to flush down. a hundred and thirty-five springs...
oh, we stopped those when the kids said i was too fat to carry.
there are some dogs. we could all ride dogs.
pew, well, i dodged a bullet.
clown. thanks, noodles.
hey, it's not just a store. it's a "mega" store. "mega" means "good." and "store" means "thing."
i don't know. just give me the dollar.
i do!
i do.
i see. well, i'll need some beer.
well, you don't have to call me slovenly.
can do.
gee, i feel bad. if people knew the real monty burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you.
you see white people have names like "lenny," whereas, black people have names like "carl."
ooo, arthur fortune. you know what that fabulous man just did? he gave the springfield zoo two male pandas, and got them to mate successfully.
oh, yeah! and i'm not easily impressed. wow! a blue car!
a sober irishman?
hey, willie. that old couple looks just like you.
uh, to work in your power plant?
check.
don't worry, mr. burns. we're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. besides, i'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt! can you believe i'm a size four? woo!
no way! aberdeen rules!
shuuuut uppa you mouth.
all right, a gross-out contest! grandma plopwell, you've done it again.
i'm hot buttered / check it and see / i got a fever of four fifty-three... i'm hot... so very hot... fours? ow! ow! oh!
judges can't win the contest! booooo!
no. but i got it. stealing is wrong.
yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale.
hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. i'm gonna read it just as soon as i finish what i'm doing here.
i envy them.
who told you?
uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?
well, i don't, but the block association seems to. they wanted a "traditional" santa claus.
oh, that's great, honey. you tell me everything you can before the commercial's over.
are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?
please be kind.
now you're sure this will save my marriage?
it's time to get homer-erotic.
grrr. i'm gonna to maul you.
no, no. it's just our basement.
yeah, so? come on! more kissing!
but i was gonna score...
now's our opening. come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town!
did you have fun with your robot buddy?
i am.
wow. i can't believe someone i never heard of is hangin' out with a guy like me.
"gigabytes!" they've done it again. gigabytes. wait, this isn't "weird." why, there's no magazine called "weird," is there?
the internet? is that thing still around?
come on, lisa! monkeys!
oh yeah. i'm betting on jai-alai in the cayman islands, i invested in something called news corp...
well, let's check the old bank account. see? even after all my cyber-squandering we've still got twelve hundred dollars.
you seem to know an awful lot about this for an "innocent person."
ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, i'll get us the money. even if i have to get a second job.
yes, sir.
well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine...
sweet.
go on...
maybe you're right, ned. maybe you're right.
i'm squeezing... i'm squee-zing it. hey, i squeezed so hard it went into my hand.
wow, this plankton's only 33 cents.
sure, by their standards, but we live in america.
but it's so cheap.
no, mon, let's go home to jamaica. i and i been in babylon too long.
no, no japan. jamaica! i wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side.
oh, so flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh? c'mon!
that's not how i remember it. besides, if we want to see japanese people we could have gone to the zoo.
yeah, isn't it amazing? they're filming one right now in the bathroom. it's gonna be on towards the end of the flight.
marge, they stole my idea!
i don't have time for that.
ohh, yeah...
whew. all that seizing made me hungry.
the toilet recommended a place called americatown.
let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.
oooh, they got our number.
oh, of course. you're right. you know, i read about a shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... run, bart!
looks like he's doing a commercial.
hmmm... spare some salt, tubby?
hey, that's mine! like we say in my country, "hasta la vista, baby."
thank god. i couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.
oh, i'm sick of doing japanese stuff. in jail we had to be in this dumb kabuki play about the forty-seven ronin and i wanted to be oshi, but they made me ori.
don't worry, ichiban. i'll show you something japanese.
it's a crane. the japanese believe they bring good luck.
this sucks. what else is on?
well, i haven't talked it over with the family, but i think we'd all like a free dinner at americatown.
ignor-- what?
do "ow that hurts."
is the answer japan?
why are you so cruel?
well, at least we're past the lightning round. hmmm, i see... i sure hope they don't have an ice cream round.
marge! your shoe!
it burns! it burns!
before i go, i want to say something. game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. but somewhere along the line, you lost your way. for shame.
undo! undo!
my children deserve to see me get a free gift.
hello, i, uh, love your planet deeply and am interested in purchasing one of your electronic autos.
what kind a mint?
yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too.
relax, we're in an electric car.
well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now.
aww, movie tickets! that hardly seems worth destroying a car.
who else is in it?
mel gibson is just a guy, marge. no different than me or lenny.
okay... uh, you're thinking about me, right?
i will now.
bo-ring.
at least the jimmy stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.
oh, you're just saying that because your "boyfriend" was in it. i'll bet you would've hated it if me and lenny were mr. smith.
got a pencil?
thanks. stupid... 'preciate it.
and i've been lookin' for you, too, pal!
huh?
really? you want my help? marge, did you hear that? mel gibson wants my help! mel gibson!
shuut-uup...
she's always doing that, mel.
you had me at "hello."
sweet.
sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. mel's movie really stinks.
okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. it'll let us see your playful side.
they will if you set up that the dog is evil. all you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
ah-ah-ah! now here's your biggest problem of all...
and it was fine for the 1930's. the country was doing great back then. everyone was into talking. but now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! and seats with beverage holders, but mainly action.
oh! mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage i've ever seen. and it's not easy for me to say that.
... we-shot-last-night...
mel, you're coming off desperate. roll it, louie! here comes two!
i second that motion... ...with a vengeance!
those movies sucked. i only saw 'em to get marge into the sack. ps: mission accomplished.
do the words "executive producer" mean anything to you?
we'll talk.
watch out! comin' through! mach schnell!
i'm on it.
hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. we're not finished yet.
no time talk! need steal car! must save powerful but controversial movie!
movies aren't stupid! they fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. "lethal weapon" showed us that suicide is funny.
before "lethal weapon 2", i never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now i check every time.
well, i think we lost 'em. oh, wait. there they are.
i'm tired of running away. did "braveheart" run away? did "payback" run away? it's time we showed those suits what we're made of.
it's your plan, from "braveheart." your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered.
actually, i didn't see it, but on the poster it...
i don't get it, mel. how can you be so calm and cool? my stomach's full of vomiting butterflies. okay, that's it. let's get ready to meet our public.
/ ow! we shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes. oh, i'm sorry i ruined your career, mel.
how did the country lose its way, mel? when did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?
well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture. hey, what about a prequel to something? everybody loves prequels.
thank you for getting me out of work.
yeah, he's somethin' else, all right.
hey, that looks like bart.
hi, marge. it's me, homer.
i'd say he's coming out of the pep closet.
they become your slaves...
it's all about trust, honey.
some special helpers that'll make you a good boy.
andy dick...
yeah, and i'm a size four.
why you little...!
just take one bite. if you're not one hundred per cent different... ow! geez, what's the big deal? look, i'll even eat some. now--
hmm. my career has kinda lost momentum...
well, i have been thinking about making them into cut-offs...
you know it. plus he gave me this appointment dealy. got my whole week in there.
and look at this. a cheese grater!
he's gone from goofus to gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills.
ooh, let's go to the waterpark. my ten-year ban ended yesterday.
oh... marge!
really? with butterscotch on it?
well, sure, if it's true.
ray j. funny... or o.j. funny?
even mine? hey, i had lenny's name on that!
maarge. i think bart's gone crazy!
after we trusted you...
uh-oh. somebody's gonna have a tummyache.
we should have paid more attention to these side-effects. it's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea...
but how do we know, marge? how do we know?
my god, is she brave. standing up to that freaked-out junkie.
why don't you just tell everybody?
the frame store! you monster!
and mark mcgwire gave you an autographed bat.
don't worry, sweetie. daddy's got it covered.
god bless you, nelson muntz.
hey, you , you cut me off! ah, yeah, you!
oh, right. ambulance! think you're so big with your siren, and your letters on backwards. here we are kids -- the zoo.
ooo... pointless nostalgia. i'd sure hate to be him.
i'll have you know i wandered off from the tour.
oh, i like food all right. i like pizza / i like bagels / i like hot dogs, with mustard and beer...
i'll eat eggplant / i could even eat a baby deer... la la la la la la la la la la... who's that baby deer on the lawn, there...
no, it usually takes a few hours.
thanks for the chance. you won't never regret this, mr. editing guy!
we don't need no stinkin' "e". restaurant review... no. eatery evaluation... no. food box... go or no go? by homer... no. earl. no. bill simpson!
what's wrong with it?
no, no, you're right. it's a joke. everyone laugh at the funny joke . i'll be right back with the real review.
great. now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious...
that's brilliant. and they have this sweet, sweet chocolate mousse -- really, the only word for it is .
how about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
how about "screw flanders"?
aw, they're both good.
woo hoo! stop the presses! okay, start the presses!
whatever. i'll be at moe's.
can ya believe it, marge? this job is the greatest -- they're paying me to eat!
why you little...
welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. but this is only the beginning...
let me see. stupid script! nearly wrecked jim carrey's career! you-- i'm gonna... what?
look, marge, i'm making a difference in people's lives!
are you gonna fire me for swiping office supplies?
whew.
why, you... you made them cancel "platypus man!"
sorry.
for you, perhaps.
i've given out my share of bad reviews.
it lost some points 'cause it had a hot wheel on it.
okay.
hm. this pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy.
the other critics told me to be mean. and you should always give in to peer pressure.
always.
mm. sorry, marge. i'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up.
marge, i'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: "shake" and "bake."
people change, marge. my palate has grown more sophisticated.
oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... gotta go! so come to the legless frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. p.s. parking was ample.
nobody talks to me that way! i'm homer simpson! the most powerful food critic in town, who will never get his comeuppance! you hear me? no comeuppance! we'll be right back.
"rough!" ah, i don't know. you've been pitching that all night.
chewy! that's inspired.
are you crazy? a dog can't type. unfortunately.
oh, marge, something bad usually happens to me when i go in anywhere. a bat! now that's a new one. so what are you up to, young lady?
oh. well, i'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me. pedestrian. uninspired. i didn't say stop!
oh, so full... bellybutton moving from innie to outie...
ooh, sweet.
noooo!
oh, lisa... you saved me! and after all the bad things i said about you.
oh, lisa, the important thing is, i didn't get my comeuppance, and i never will.
i know, honey. the important thing is -- run! finally getting my comeuppance.
guess i forgot to put the fog lights in...
he's dead! he's definitely dead!
don't worry. i've got a plan. okay, ned, the first thing we have to do is... to make sure that no one knows that you're dead. and if anyone asks... you're not dead.
hi, maude. diddily. i've been having fun with my pal homer. diddily.
wow, it sure is slippery up here.
aww, she missed it.
when i think about ned, i can't help but remember the look on his face when marge drove over...
oh, wait... what i'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife.
but you got to kill...
y'ello?
who is this?
no, it's homer.
guess i forgot to put the fog lights in...
hey, foamy, i want the news, not the weather. marge, did you hear me zing werewolf flanders?
geez, marge, tell the neighborhood.
absolutely.
that can't be true, honey. if it were, i'd be terrified.
uh-oh.
well, those ivory tower eggheads have screwed us again. let's just have some milk and go to bed... hey, this milk's broken.
stop! ow!
but i was gonna loot you a present!
wonders, lisa? or blunders?
implied, lisa? or implode?
thank you, sweet clown. in death you saved us all.
just like the dead clown promised.
that's us!
certainly. i am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie "shine."
uh... shiny mcshine?
and there's nobody guarding it. let's go!
you're right. i gotta let it go. all that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats. ooh, there's ross perot, dr. laura, spike lee...
okay, but there's... dan quayle and courtney love... tanya harding... al sharpton...? tom arnold?! what the hell's going on?!
so we're all gonna die?
oh no, rosie o'donnell.
not fast enough!
i have to go to ze lobby!
you're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either.
sh-sh-shh!
i challenge you to a duel.
will you duel, or are you a coward?!
uh, uh. "h" is for homer.
no tommy tune, eh? oh, that's it. you insulted my honor.
i demand satisfaction! i challenge you to a duel.
really? but you've never given anyone a free beer.
wow, a free beer! and i owe it all to a little glove slap. glove slap... baby, glove slap...
aisle six?
sir, that is an insult! i challenge you... what? oh. oh, honey, i had the worst nightmare. this glove kept slapping people and i was getting blamed.
he's out there, isn't he?
oh marge, that's in the past. just let it go.
i was afraid of that. well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. you know, i've always wanted to tell you how mu...
ah, screw it.
ooh! how 'bout that house?
lousy show-offs.
come on, move it!
how should i know?
'cause i'm trying to think! what would zorro do? zo-rrooo! rural route 9? that's it! we can hide out at the farm where i grew up!
yeah, it'll be fun. fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides...
just think of 'em as cats with rabies. hello, kitty. you little scamp.
absolutely. this is our big chance. the simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
that's my girl. let the agriculture begin!
hang on. and... there. now we're talkin'!
this car was made in guatemala.
i bought these shoes from a hobo.
i'm sorry, i believe in good grooming.
aw, what do you know?
yeah, i hope i can grow some like that.
oh, a little bit of everything. something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil. and for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... i'm down.
move the handbrake...
i'm only one man, marge.
sorry, boy. going back to springfield would be a coward's way out.
oh, you're right. i'm a coward. i've made such a mess of things. if only there was some magic potion that would make those crops grow... wait a minute.
of course not. but you know something? sometimes you have to break the rules to free your heart.
well, when there's nothing left to believe in, believe in hope.
shut up and kiss me.
that's all it takes. if we learned one thing from "the amazing colossal man," and "grasshopperus," it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast.
only 'cause he tried to reason with him.
brace yourselves, everybody. you're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. you might want to crane your necks upward now to save time. ta-da!
this better be good.
a sprout! and there's some more!
who cares what it is? it's growing! i've saved the farm! look at my babies. this tomato will be heinz ketchup. and this to-mah-to will be hunt's catsup. bup, no fighting, boys.
oh, great. i got a field full of mutants.
aw, thanks honey.
yes, it's the latest craze. try some, won't you?
don't push. there's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
you're scaring the customers, honey.
those dirty rotten...
how much?
one hundred and... may i speak to my family for a moment?
oh, yeah. let's take it.
i agree, but how?
lisa, there's absolutely no evidence this is...
no, i'd rather die! take it!
so, mindy? how did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million? cash'll be okay! or stock? does your company have stock? mindy? mindy and i are just hammering out a payment plan. we'll talk monday!
hey, are we duellin' or what?
i think so. the bone stopped the bullet.
after pie.
did somebody say num num?
waldo, where are you?!
over there.
no! i can't get in trouble if i can't see you.
mr. burns is making me eat all these drums of toxic waste.
yeah, so i'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what i really want.
are poo and ass taken?
damn! could my life get any worse?!
hey, guys. is it normal to see burns' face on a bowling ball?
really?
lenny...
practice ball! practice ball! real real real real real! woo hoo!
why won't they come over? i'm so lonely.
thank you! thank you! but there was someone else with me on that alley. i'm talkin' about the big man, carl.
thank you, bart's teacher. you know, kids, my teachers said i would never amount to anything. and until last week, they were dead right. but now i've achieved perfection. any questions? yes, bart's weird friend.
you've got a father. he's just a dud. next question. yes, the girl bart has a crush on.
yes, kent?
dream on, drunky!
flavor of the month? me?
i 'unno... because you weren't cute anymore?
hello, everybody! did somebody say a perfect game?
hey, i thought you never talked.
remember springfield, keep on swinging!
hey, everybody! i'm gonna be on tv again. that's right. you've got a special daddy.
woo hoo! first stop, maude flanders.
lisa, i know what's going on here. they did it to jesus and now they're doing it to me.
well, in bowling ability.
mm-hmmm.
you're right!
i wanna live!
it's a glandular problemmmm!
not anymore, ron. now, i'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. something noble, but easy.
that's great. even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
no. i don't want your pity or your money.
i do what now?
i can see i'm not needed here.
actually, that was before i went in the ocean.
well, all i care about is that my little girl loves me. and we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on.
and these bean bag chairs look so comfortable. hey, there's someone else in here.
he's named after what he is.
hey, apu, manjula. you guys are still married?
kids are the best, apu. you can teach them to hate the things you hate. and they practically raise themselves, what with the internet and all.
whoa, too much information! thanks for the mental picture. why don't you tell us what you really think?
could you be any more...? hel-lo! look, just give me some ice cream. more than i wanted to knoooow!
but the cans seal in the flavor.
decided? that's classic. decided. babies just happen.
really? on top and underneath?
well, don't worry, i can help ya. i'm all about ideas. kids, come and get it!
up-bup-bup-bup! that's an apu question. you're "greg."
and that's my cue to exit.
i just wanted to invite you to the wrap party. and that's my cue to exit.
apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies. yeah. it looked just like that.
mine tasted like strawberry. mmm... ovulicious.
boy, that hansel sure can eat. my corneas! you were saying?
eight kids. hm, i'm sterile, right baby doll?
beautiful.
apu? manjula? marge, i've got a bad feeling about this.
she's no liza, but it works.
don't worry. i brought some chloroform. there... and... there...
not any more!
okay, okay... don't panic. release the mongoose!
i remember television!
nah. we'll go next month.
wow, look at this old-timey gizmo! i feel like i've gone back in a time machine.
what an age we live in.
woo-hoo! it's mine. finally, i've won the respect of my fellow... get away from it!
promise you won't laugh?
i don't know how.
will you teach me?
remember to rebel against authority, kids.
quiet, marge. the motorcycle and i are trying to sleep. i know, i know. just tune her out.
yeah, that's the life for me, marge. cruisin' and hasslin' shopkeepers.
hey, don't make me hassle you, lisa. you know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles.
i'm the president and the decision is mine. we're hell's satans. besides, i've already made our club jackets.
can't hassle us, pig. we're goin' the speed limit. oink, oink, oink.
you can lock us away, but you'll never defeat the cobras.
oink! oink! oink!
if you'd've been awake you would have said no. you can see the bind i was in.
you're the hell's satans? what a fun coincidence. my gang's name is also the...
okay.
all right.
caps and frisbees, sir.
and some pogs.
hello, police? can you send a swat team to 742 evergreen ter...
but you have so much inner beauty.
okay, bikers, that's it. benjamin franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? they're gone! woo hoo! ... and those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look i get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.
yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. marge? marge?!
really? read it.
oh, that's sweet.
i guess i'll never find her.
no! my wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. i took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever.
uh-oh.
you and me, chopper to chopper.
give me back my wife!
whaddaya say, honey?
no dice!
taking care of some unfinished business.
what's going on? and i want the non-gay explanation.
oh, thank god.
where are the refreshments?
maybe you should shut up.
get 'em, boy. hit those smart-ass books.
uhh. is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? is that what this is, lisa?
now, let's see. this will make three christmases i saved versus eight i ruined... two were kind of a draw...
hah! if i had a nickel for every time i've heard that...
perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics. i think what lisa meant to say is...
hey, it is christmas. we'd better get home.
um, uh... mr. coleman, i've been thinking... my wife always makes too much stuffing and sweet p'taters and all, and... aw, heck! would you like to spend christmas with us?
i like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
our junk! and the exits are sealed! go to plan b!
come on!
useless? this flash cube has two flashes left!
hey, let's go skiing right now!
where?!
hmmm... "the widowmaker," oh, that one's for the ladies. "spinebuster," boring. ooh, "colostomizer." don't hurt me! here's my wallet.
flanders! that suit's a little revealing, isn't it?
quit it! must wash eyes! j-- uh-oh. okay, don't panic. remember what the instructor said...
you missed all the fun.
i want my wife to get the best treatment money can buy. whoa-whoa-whoa! don't go nuts. uh... better than that. perfect.
we'll be fine, honey. the main thing is for you to get better.
take that! woo! woo! h-hey! hey!
and you're "interferon" with our good time!
i don't know.
i guess, or one of her friends.
come on, "bikini inspector!" "scrub toilet?" okay, that was a practice. practice... practice... okay, here we go. "feed fish."
lisa, i'll do the dishes when i pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. see, there it is. but that was a practice. the system works! c'mon, eat, you lazy fish.
oh, but lenny just got some bottle rockets.
lisa, help!
i got the groceries!
oh yeah. you were way off. hello, lollipop island? there's a little girl here who had too many sourballs.
marco!
marco!
marc--
jesus?
you don't? 'cause that's what i said! tell her, bart.
yes...
yes! yesssss!
leprosy? i can't believe it! that fortune cookie was right.
mops? the cure sounds worse than the disease.
well, i think we're on the outs with him, but i know someone who's even holier than jesus.
use your brains to help us. your delicious brains.
bart! leave some for rod and todd! here you go, lad.
so you're shunning us.
oh, thank you good sir.
that it is. we'll take the cure, bag a few lobsters, then watch some gay guys get married.
really? the whole beach?
electric needle room?!
i figured it out after i ate one of my chest sores.
this place is a blast. all we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing.
that's me! aloha / aloha until we meet a-
remember my love affair with ali mcgraw? she used to call me "preppy." then she died.
then the big game between springfield u. and springfield a & m. i hate springfield u. so much.
so much.
one million times...
make me.
okay. all right. okay.
i'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
oh, that's it. you're through, dean! now who's the dean?
oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? oh, there's no such thing.
what guys? i wanna see the freaks.
easy... easy... too far.
cure me! cure me!
yeah. and i got a bucket on my head!
i see the light! it burns!
uh, miracle boy? i believe i had hair. oh, here they are.
yeah, you're right.
it's not to scale.
and chili fries!
can't make a float without flowers.
woo hoo! go s.u.!
yeah, well you went to a cow college!
okay, who needs another lamb rack? lisa? ham hock? tri tip?
well, i think the veal might have died of loneliness...
i forgot my float! quick, pass me down!
wait! hang on!
wait! wait! i got a float too! listen up, 'cause i gotta explain a lot of it! boo?
out of the way, baryshnikov!
no, wait! i got a kid who's a miracle worker! he'll heal him up real good.
or else what? oh, right. the ice pick. bart, i need a miracle!
please, bart. you've gotta use your powers! i'm beggin' ya!
bart, do your thing!
this is my year, marge. everyone knows i'm what makes this city great.
wha...?! who are you?
everyone gets an award but me.
oh, why won't anyone give me an award?
what's that, sonny?
well, that was a great night for us all.
nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
look at me, i'm a billionaire!
wasteful and practical. a mechanical dressing dealy! watch this, marge. now i'm ready to hit the town.
i'm drunk!
look how loud i have to yell!
why, marge, i believe you're supposed to scratch your ass with it.
jimmy is such an ugly word, marge. unless you're talking about jimmy smits.
listen, i worked long and hard for this place. and no one's going to take it away from me. not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody. and another thing: if i ev... operator, get me thailand. t...i... and so on.
everybody. i found burnsie's address book. i called the new york yankees and told them to bunt, and then i called the queen of england and asked her how it was going, and then i...
just a second, marge. hello! thailand? how's everything on your end? uh-huh. that's some language you got there. and you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh? hey!
marge, you're right. we do have to have a party.
what about partays?
damn! and i looked so good on that box.
mmmm, danish.
but i need that beer now.
what's that, a theme park?
they were so drunk. gentlemen, get off your knees. your rich uncle homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen! and you're invited.
marge, you know i normally listen to you, but i've gotta seize this opportunity. just in case i never become a real billionaire.
ships ahoy! well done, mr. lenny. well done.
we made it, son. international waters -- the land that law forgot.
that's right. see that ship over there? they're rebroadcasting major league baseball with implied oral consent, not expressed written consent! or so the legend goes.
there are no laws. we can do anything we want! anything! ow, ow! oh, real mature, lenny.
what have you done with my party guests?
help, pirates!
oh, bless you!
oh, that would be just... you're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?
shut up, net face.
i said shut up, net face!
ahhhh!
that was my plan all along. now relax and the currents will take us home.
uh, mr. burns, pirates got your yacht.
i don't know. after living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump.
that's right. just because we're not rich, doesn't mean that we don't have... oh, i can't even finish. i wanna be rich! like these guys. and look at all these rich people here. not as rich as they should be of course. but still rich. all that big money. look at all of these. got all this money. i have lots of money. oh look at all the other people. oh, look at all the people who can buy and sell me. i should send a list of these names to the irs. i'm takin' 'em all down. oh, look at all the rich people. oh, look at the rich...
don't shush me, you rich bastards!
why should i? did my country give me a parade? no, man! they spat at me and...
thanks. this closes the saddest chapter in american history.
it's b.t.o.! they're canada's answer to e.l.p. their big hit was "t.c.b." that's how we talked in the '70s. we didn't have a moment to spare.
takin' care of business!
get to the "workin' overtime" part!
work out!
what-everrr!
i stand by my disappointed groan.
see, marge? i told you they could deep-fry my shirt.
anybody care what this guy thinks?
but he'll bring us joy, marge. unlike all your silly gewgaws.
marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. but don't worry, i have a way for duncan to earn his keep.
huh?
racehorse, eh?
son, i learned everything i needed to know from "the horse whisperer". step one: seduce a lonely housewife. ma'am. now for the actual horse whispering. when the race starts, run really fast!
champion horse, coming through!
hey, what's with the attitude? i just want some dealies.
he ran all the way here.
well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. we're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. all those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies.
not anymore. ladies, say hello to...
i've been waiting all my life to hear that.
but you're respected athletes! you own car dealerships and marry beauty queens.
what do you want me to do?
my horse must lose?
my horse must lose!
oh, it is, it is. but we've been pushing that poor horse too hard.
well, it is a good life, believe me... all right, we'll give it a shot. i'll deal with those murderous trolls.
i mean, i'll deal with those murderous trolls.
nah, we're cool. marge, now! son, go get me a trash bag.
now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies.
but what if i have to do my business?
how come bears can crap in the woods and i can't?
okay, nobody panic. there's plenty of spray for me.
no they didn't. they just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit.
better do what he says, marge.
we can hike anytime. this is our chance to see cars driving.
be patient, son. a rushed car never crashes. oh, i missed one!
let's go! new tires! c'mon, c'mon!
oh, how rude of me. my name is... my bad.
finally!
hey, t-shirt- t-shirt-t-shirt!
oooh, a bobby pin.
and poor ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. well, from now on i'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much i love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. maybe just a pat on the butt. yeah, that works.
i know. no more being a jerk.
quit hogging flanders. i want to comfort him.
then i insist on walking you home.
those feelings are normal, ned. they're part of the process. watch the sprinkler.
it's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkler is gone. it's time to let go.
sleep tight, neddie.
okay, be right down.
yep, it would've been a lot better if you'd said "i love you," or "you're special." you know, something sweet instead of that hot dog crack.
now, now, now. don't beat yourself up. i'm the one who drove her out of her seat. i'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. i'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation... but, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game.
you'll see...
i think it's pretty obvious that i don't.
okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of flanders paying his bills... then we star-wipe to flanders brushing his...
why eat hamburger when you can have steak?
now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of maggie being born that i couldn't get rid of... anyway, enjoy. single women of springfield, your prayers have been flanswered. ned flanswered, that is.
shush. what would you say about a man who owns his own house... and his own car? that's ned flanders. a man who's not afraid to cry. hey, ned.
yeah. ned does everything with class. whether he's punching in his atm code...or keeping clean in the shower...
but don't take my word for it. listen to this testimonial.
...step up to the best. ned flanders, the man with the chest.
now, we'll just send this to the dating service, the chicks'll fall for you, and bam! the healing begins.
oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. chicks really dig sensitivity. did you get that, bart?
beautiful! and star-wipe, aaaand we're out.
how could she not? the place is full of eligible bachelors -- john wayne, tupac shakur, sherlock holmes...
he sure is!
that's right, ned. those floozies we married in vegas were crazy about you.
marge, we're trying to help ned.
hey, i'm as surprised as you, but i've stumbled upon the most delicious british sit-com.
it's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. if they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker.
the mother's the voice of reason.
hey, what the hell's going on?!
finally.
why are you torturing me? i'm just a man.
well, why didn't you say so? yes, i'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. from... anonymous. done and done.
eh, how're they gonna find me?
uh-oh. you've gotta help me, bart. that's it, boy! go get help!
umm... it's an honor to give ten thousand dollars, especially now, when the rich mosaic of cable programming has made public television so very, very unnecessary.
will cash be okay?
well, then we've got a problem. the banks are closed by now.
i'd like to withdraw ten thousand dollars, please.
i'll pay you later.
uh, why, no. uh... everything is just... i can't do it. i can't kill a man!
mm-mm.
the hooligans!
quick! you've got to hide me from pbs! their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the chubb group!
please help me! i'll do anything! i'll light a candle! i'll help with your next charity scam!
sure, sure, bob's your uncle. let's just get outta here!
south pacific?! i didn't agree to...
oh, save me jebus!
jebus, where are you?! homer to jebus!
you're leaving? wait, what do i do here?
me homer. me hiding from pbs.
here you go. knock yourself out.
does the word "jet-lag" mean anything to you people? "jet-laggg".
oh, yes. very much so.
great. now my testicle's got ants on it. thanks, sweetheart. have a bible. my name's homer. what's yours?
i'm gonna call you lisa junior. so, what do you do for fun around here?
craig and amy, craig and amy. why don't you just marry craig and amy?
so, how's the tv reception here? excellent, or...?
no couches either? oh, man. i need a beer. oh, god! oh, god! oh, god! oh, god!
nothin'. here we go. ee-yeah.
marge!
i guess so, but that first month was pretty rough.
mmm, i can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: bart, you're the man of the house. lisa -- i'm promoting you to boy. maggie's now the brainy girl. the toaster can fill in for maggie. and marge, you're a consultant.
yes, boy?
really? you're proud of me?
oh, really? well, if you'll excuse me, i've got some civilization to spread like butter on the english muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies...
please, please, that's not necessary. i'm just god's messenger. and lo, what a wondrous message it is: like this, from the book of p-salms: "god will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. that you may bathe your feet in blood." as true today as it was when it was written. now, let's open it up to some q & a. yes, lisa junior?
well, not the unitarians. if that's the one true faith, i'll eat my hat.
well, ak, it's because god is powerful, but also insecure, like barbra streisand, before james brolin. oh, he's been a rock. oh, who am i kidding? the truth is, i'm no missionary. i work in a nuclear power plant.
look, the point is, i want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. what you need's a little razzle dazzle. qtoktok, are you thinking what i'm thinking?
it could be you!
woo hoo!
oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. now i know how bob stupak feels.
oh, what happened?! i gave you a glittering vegas, and you turned it into a skanky atlantic city!
since i got here. now either grab a stone or go to hell. well, i may not know much about god, but i have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for him.
not bad, lisa junior. but god's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume. do you hear me, lord?! homer's doing your work! i'm the greatest missionary of all time! of all time! oh, no! this looks like the end!
get in! move it! this is not a drill!
i know. i'm a character. now a little beer music to get in the mood. looking for these? dee-dee-dee.
go moe! boo everyone else!
all right, guys. one, two, three. moo?! lenny, you were supposed to be "e".
that one.
aw, maggie wants a balloon and daddy will take a hand stamp so he can get back in.
oh, moe. there's lots of people uglier than you. like, you ever been to white castle?
caveman brow...
c'mon, moe. don't feel bad. there's too much emphasis on looks these days. that's why they won't let bill maher on tv before midnight.
okay, now do moe.
oh, you dear, dear man. you're one of us beautiful people now. and your new life begins today.
yeah!
run!
you're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.
hey, moe. beer me!
hmm. this isn't nearly as complicated as moe made it seem.
you don't love me. the only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion.
that was amazing, moe. i'm actually a little turned on.
the one with the amulet?
what? let me see that! "interior coroner's office. close-up on dr. winslow's mangled corpse. coroner: 'let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'" yep, that does sound kinda bad.
ding-dong!
dr. winslooooow...
you're going to die in a skydiving accident.
gabriella's baby shower will be invaded by terrorists. with sexy results.
well, sister bernadette will leave the convent and start a softball team. with sexy results.
yeah!
what?
all right! geez...
god bless native america. let's go, marge. c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
well, what better place to celebrate your recovery than amidst the frenzied excitement of the casino floor? lisa?
sorry, son. although they seem strange to us, we must respect the ways of the indian. hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya.
oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!
right, right, present. anyway, can i get you some soylent green?
oh, here we go.
you should've thought of that before you dropped out of the devry institute.
i'm still cool.
well, i do have this robotic prostate, but you can't see it. oh, you can.
she knows what time dinner is.
i started what from a what?
gold bars discovered by marge? zero. gold bars discovered by homer? well, let's just see... oops, sorry, honey.
shut up.
oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...
that lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!
quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. and remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice. see? a new pacifier for maggie.
especially when we send it to him piece by piece.
all i know is, i'm finally getting the support i need.
hey flanders? can your god do that?
i'll be at moe's.
i threw you a party at my house.
you wish. that's the stage we call "professor barney" -- talkative, coherent, even insightful. here's drunk.
disgracefully hilarious! you passed out before we could even give you your presents.
wait a minute, barney. you gotta be sober to fly. i mean, it's not like drivin' a car.
barney, didn't you say you were gonna stop drinking?
you came to the right guy. i'll straighten ya out... right after i finish this beer. ah, man that's sweet. okay, let's go.
is there any other st. louis?
not a chance. i can sink way lower. i just came to help my friend barney.
the sugar cookies you speak of. are they real or symbolic?
i don't wanna walk that far. anything that takes twelve steps isn't worth doing. get it? huh? twelve? steps.
well, forget it, guys. i am not barney!
okay...
if i didn't, i'd lose their respect.
can i, marge? can i?
oh, so you're better than me, is that it?
take me home.
i'll scream.
i don't wanna talk about it! stupid barney, thinks he's too good for me.
lenny and carl suck. please don't tell lenny and carl i said that, 'cause if i ever lost them as friends...
oh, why can't i have a nickname?
barney.
that's right.
you keep thinkin' that.
me too.
good day, then is right.
ta-ta.
well, if it isn't little miss "i'm not wasting my life anymore." which he is.
oh, no! that's bart and lisa!
barney... the call is from heroism. will you accept the charges?
look out!
no! you've gotta be sober for this. gimme that! ugh, it's warm.
oh, yes i can! gimme that! i won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. i love you. let's not lose touch after graduation.
stay away from my wife!
hi, kids!
all right, i'm comin'.
you can't prove i did it.
i could do a lotta things if i had some money.
yeah. so what do you call this stuff?
...and three makes three.
it'll be real soon enough. ooh, my first issue of "self-test monthly." finally i get to find out what makes me tick.
yeah, but in what ratio? are you a good driver? "yes." "are you a good lover?" "yes." oh, i'm doin' great!
my way is easier.
no way. when?
oh, yeah. i saw a gopher. what a day!
according to this you're both idiots.
fine. i'll take the next quiz. "how long will you live?" "in an average week, how many braised ribs do you eat?" marge, do you think that counts honey-braised?
i've only got three more years to live!
see?! and these quizzes are never wrong, marge. they're put together by the finest scientists in the magazine business.
no! can't sleep. gonna die. can't sleep. gonna die.
i'm not crazy. it's the tv that's crazy. aren't you, tv?
you gotta hide me. death is after me! and i don't entirely trust these cowboys.
a mother can't die. and i'm a mother. see?
sometimes. but the guy i really hate is your father.
why isn't my baby gaining weight?
florida? but that's america's wang.
my pockets hurt.
par-ty!
uh, could you just uh... shut off the...
oh, no, it's a lost child! don't worry, folks. i'll tackle him.
bawitdaba / banana fana / ooga chocka / etc.
bring on the rappin' granny! what? she's hilarious.
all for homer... all for homer...
they called you a pig, sheriff.
guess how many boobs i saw today, marge? fifteen!
doesn't he talk funny? my insomnia, it's gone! check it out, marge. i'm sane again! and i owe it all to... spring break! whoo! i'm an animal! hey, where is everybody?
fine. be nerds. i'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.
the gi-ant...
you'll have to catch me first.
look. this is our chance. let's go!
well, i'm gonna try anyway. it worked! it's a miracle!
no shade! perfect.
or die trying...
the only thing we can do. sit tight, and try to get some sleep.
rise and shine, everybody.
i love being married.
that's perfect! we can hide out here 'til the heat's off.
woo hoo!
more hashbrowns, sugar?
...gonna try to...
...knock you out...
you know, killing that gator was the best decision i ever made.
yep, this place is great. and someday, when lisa and bart get married, it'll all be theirs.
you'd better.
your honor, i'd like to represent myself. drunken hicks of the jury...
uhh... no.
well, what am i supposed to do?
arizona smells funny.
poor cyborganizer
talking while the tv's on can't be good for you.
nah. i want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.
whee! touch the sky, maggie! whee! touch the sky!
who said that?
sorry.
i... 8... p.p. why you little...
oo, my favorite door.
ew. she ruined the plastic ono band.
would it get me out of having to choose glasses?
less yappin', more zappin'.
yes, dear.
didn't you ever go to camp? the ol' vitamin barn...
look at you, all sugar and spice instead of equations and test tubes. you're daddy's precious dancing queen!
now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?
shh! this plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!
go, lisa! c'mon, everybody, give it up for my little girl!
i didn't think, i just acted.
oh. ohhhhh. well, now that i look even closer...
that's not true, honey. you can always write a depressing broadway play of some kind.
hey, yeah. you could load it up with lots of swears. that's what david mamet does.
why? it's just a cute little weasel. hello there, mister weasel. i'm down.
i didn't hit your precious table.
oh, that's just superstition.
in about fifteen minutes i'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy.
yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man.
what are these things in the mashed potatoes?
no! oh, becky, your potatoes are the best i've ever had. oh, god.
take your time!
becky, i think i speak for all of us when i say "when's the ice cream gonna get here?"
don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. to finish off becky. then we'll have mommy back.
i heard she mates with men, then eats them.
oh, about that. uh -- when i changed your oil, i may have drained your brake fluid. i didn't say anything 'cause i thought you'd be mad.
you monsters! you've killed her!
everybody wanted a piece of us.
then we figured out we could park them in front of the tv. that's how i was raised, and i turned out tv.
our favorite show was "hollywood hogwash." but we also loved "the dreck squad"...
but we never saw people like us on tv.
mamma mia! now i'll have to do it.
not now. i'm busy turning on this washing machine.
mamma mia!
every day i thought about firing marge. you know, just to shake things up.
you're almost there.
good.
son, let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.
why you little...!
i want to set the record straight. i thought the cop was a prostitute.
everything was goin' great at first. i felt like i was king of the world. i'm king of the world! woo hoo! woo hoo! right about here, i realize something's wrong. yep, there i go. then came the rocks. jagged rocks. hitting me with their jags.
oh, my leg! this is the worst pain ever! stop pummeling me! it's really painful! owww! why did i take such punishment? let's just say that fame was like a drug. but what was even more like a drug was the drugs.
hey, they can't take our house. my pot-bellied pig is in there. ohhhh, mister. porky.
no, something that rocks. that's the sound of today.
rocks!
i'll kill you!
hey, hey, stop it!
that slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. it gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. i returned to my first love, the legitimate theater.
where is the rent? / i must have the rent! / dollars, dimes and nickels / i need them all right now! i literally chewed the scenery.
it was the best thanksgiving ever. i mean, emotionally, it was terrible. but the turkey was so moist.
hi!
we put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the sunday comic strip.
why you little...!
the simpsons are going to delaware!
eh, too much baggage. oo, my horoscope. taurus: "today you will die."
ooo, scary newspaper. don't hurt me, horoscope. i'm afraid of... ow! oooh! paper cut, paper cut! missed me! stupid horoscope!
nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. snakes: nature's quitters.
fine.
st. peter! woo hoo! got to heaven before you, flanders!
i'm sorry, i didn't get the number of hours or good deeds.
woo hoo!
hey, i thought you guys could see everything.
well i'll be damned.
hello, wife! hello, children! who's up for a merry jig? oh, who am i kidding? i'm not merry. i lost my job as an oaf today.
really?
whaddaya think? do you love it? oh, i'm no dunce. i was born an oaf, and i'll die an oaf.
don't worry. no child will ever starve in my home.
mmm, sugar walls.
oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy... it's all good.
almost. just give her another twenty minutes.
comin' up!
hmm. phone's off the hook. everything must be okay.
it was her, all right. take the one who wronged you.
wait, stop! we can outsmart those dolphins! don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. i'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around! uh-oh.
hey, leave my daughter alone! c'mon, humans! we've wiped out entire species before. we can do it again!
television broken?
badger, my ass. it's probably milhouse. milhouse? milhouse?
get it.
great idea. then we should call the doctor about this.
area code? but it's a local call.
939?! what the hell is that? oh, my life is ruined.
oh, if only it were that easy, marge. go away. we've got bigger problems now. i'm not gonna stand for this. i'm gonna call the newspapers, the tv stations, the gas stations, everybody.
what really burns me up is they didn't give us one word of warning.
that's my number!
hey, that's not me!
it's not fair! i've been a fan of the who since the very beginning, when they were the hillbilly bugger boys.
good idea.
quiet, honey. daddy's asking the man a question.
wait a minute! we haven't heard from me yet. the nut with the dynamite. the phone company is bamboozling you!
and as usual, we joe twelve-packs get the royal screw job.
well, i've had it! you rich snobs aren't pushin' us around anymore!
okay, plan b. fellow 9-3-9'ers, i say we break off and form our own city!
now who's stupid?
keep walkin'
mayor, eh?
new springfield rocks!
oh yeah? what is it?
damnit!
read my lips: yes.
stop right there.
sweetie, you know your mother and i only stay together for the sake of my political career.
big grins! that'll play great in the sticks. oh, that was fifty already?
hey, the tv man is talking about us!
oh yeah?
thank you, marge. now, let's see how olde snobfield does without electricity. woo hoo!
those rich, snobby indians.
woo hoo! flood from water!
good idea. we should call the guys they used.
it's ringing.
loyal citizens of new springfield. you stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all.
i can't believe all those rats fled my town. guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.
no problem. anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back... we've got the who playing here tonight.
hey, maybe we could. but we'll need some liquid persuasion. c'mon, bart. we're gonna bring back the who.
uh...
huh? oh, right. i'll give you this bottle of chloroform if you'll take us to the who.
whatever. the point is, i'm homer simpson.
that's right.
that's right. and i implore you to move your concert to our town. don't play olde springfield, or as it is sometimes known, sun city.
c'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant who of "my generation," "won't get fooled again," and "mama's got a squeeze box"?
somethin' wrong with your legs?
oh, don't worry. they'll be here soon. and then they'll see who's got the better town. now these are the tunes i want you boys to play.
oh, c'mon, it plays itself. "pacman fever / a do do do do / it's driving me crazy." look lisa, daddy's in the who!
so, new springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? with our ample parking and daily who concerts.
ha-ha. you hit the tire fire! you'll have to do... why me?
magic bus!
pinball wizard!
well marge, looks like your insane experiment is over.
yeah, it's hopeless.
i said, it's... ohhh...
listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?
oh, don't worry. you'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. target date: january, 2007.
oh lisa, this must be a rough time for you. do you have any friends or family you can stay with?
oh, come on. tell us how we can make it up to you. hey, pretend it's your birthday.
anything at all. you name it. what do you want to do?
okay.
okay, that stings daddy's eyes, honey.
well, i won't lie. fatherhood isn't easy like motherhood. but i wouldn't trade it for anything. except for some mag wheels. oh, man, that would be sweet.
just a second, honey. daddy's on his high horse.
yeah, i'm watching, honey. nice cannonball. anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'cause over-thinking is... what were we talking about? ooh, a clown.
can we make this hand high-low?
i fold.
a weema-way, a weema-way, a weema-way, a weema-way, a-weem...
maybe so, but dawson's gonna be bummed.
oh, right. why don't we just break into fat tony's compound and get it back?
for a casual acquaintance like you? absolutely.
this is perfect! if i know fat tony, which i don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. come on.
i have a plan.
i said i was sorry.
sorry you're such jerks! ha, ha! ow! that bullet went in.
so, now you're smarter than your old man, eh?
i like your attitude. take what you need.
i knew this day would come. the cows are taking back what's theirs.
look, marge! i'm in a limo! the simpsons are going to paris!
first comes love, then comes, um... dammit, i know this.
no, i like to save the environment in my own way. mmm... donuts.
marge, she's gonna narc on our stash.
this is your fault, with your non-threatening bobby sherman-style good looks. no girl could resist your charms.
i'm sorry, i wasn't listening. i was lost in your eyes.
oh, praise god, you're alive! unless...
thanks for the beer, moe. but before lisa died, she made this tape that i think you should hear.
read it!
oh, here we go.
nooo! it was finger ling-ling good!
love you.
no, really.
oh, how embarrassing. well, let me just give you one of my many other valid... run!
okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. what are you gonna do about it?
fine. you want passion? i'll give you passion. blue spanish eyes / teardrops are falling from your spanish eyes...
i think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
i had to sell it for gas money. which i spent on a novelty horn.
financial panther, eh?
just give the word, and i'll cut him off.
consider it done.
marge, your posture looks terrible.
yes, go on...
i'm just trying to work up the courage to ask burns for a raise. or a highly-paid internship. something to solve my money woes.
that's the sneeze guard. you have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
mr. burns... i was wondering if i could get a raise.
whopping?
a laugh? okay, let's see, what's in the news today?...
at lenny? but he's a war hero!
no!
okay.
you're the boss.
will you keep giving me money?
woo hoo!
i'd like to buy a mint condition "spider-man number one," please.
do i get paid now?
little help? little help, please? i made a boom-boom...
baby made a boom-boom.
here you are, my good man. and while you're at it, throw in one of those polio shots.
i've been doing some outside projects for mr. burns.
oh, y'know, business stuff... downsizing, e-solutions, the glass ceiling...
well, why do i have to do the lindy hop?
can't take the pain...
am i glad to see you guys. you gotta call...
did you see daddy dance? they all saw me dance.
yes. i humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
i know.
well, you could treat me with a little respect.
you see, that's what i'm saying.
shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey.
she's right. yes, i may be naked and reeking of panda love, but i've got to stop this before it goes too far.
i mean, screw you!
huh? oh, why did he have to say that extra thing?
aw, thank you, sweetheart, but what should i do with this dirty, ill-gotten money? i better throw it in the garbage.
i see what you're saying -- i need to buy a gun.
i'd like to buy all these toys for some needy children. is this enough dirty, dirty money?
i'm just tryin' to dig myself out of a pit of shame.
it's okay.
i don't need to rehearse. ho, ho, ho, merry... line!
what are you doing here? i told you i'm not your monkey anymore.
oh, so much money... but santa can't be evil... but it's so much money.
not yet, honey.
let's just say lisa gave me an early christmas present. the gift of dignity.
i don't have a computer.
that does it. i'm getting a computer! as soon as somebody lets me outta here! oh. i'm so stupid.
well, a paperweight would be nice, but what i really need is a computer. how about that one?
heavens, no!
i was an astronaut.
five thousand dollars!
this is the best computer in the world and always will be, right?
that's right! top of the line! stupid pothole. don't worry, head. the computer will do our thinking now.
$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
you're it!
hmmmmm.
fine! ooh, a dancing jesus. de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de. if there's a better use for the internet, i haven't found it.
here it is, everybody! the world's greatest website! you'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not.
no kiddin'. what do you think of my page, lisa? be honest. it's great, isn't it? go ahead and say it's great if you want to.
they can't sue me if they don't know who i am. i'll just call myself mr. x.
yep, you can't go wrong with mr. x.
that lousy pothole! why don't they fix it?
get out! who told you that?
hmm, that's the kind of dirt that belongs on my web page.
nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. nelson is gold.
i did it. i changed the world. now i know exactly how god feels.
bring me two of every animal.
darn tootin'.
no way! mr. x is gonna keep on digging... and probing... until every person in this town is in jail!
oh, i don't know, carl. he might be closer than you think.
no!
i am not. or am i?
no!
not even a little one?
what if i just whisper it?
i love spying.
whoa... he's in trouble.
thank you, folks. and now i'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and... i bit my tongue!
finally.
they're with god now.
i smell another pulitzer.
let's see now... "bulletin: new race discovered living six inches under... denver."
all named 'morton'... or... 'mortonson'...
real news is great, son. but i'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-a bull plop. gimme a hundred lotto tickets, apu. because mr. x is on a roll. stop it, apu. you're scaring me. what's going on? help, i'm being kidnapped!
how do i get outta here?
but i don't know anything. at least i don't think i do.
no you won't!
i am not a number, i am a man. and don't you ever... oh, wait, i'm number 5. ha ha! in your face, number 6!
who are all these oddballs?
did you bring us here?
who are you and why are you holding me here? i want answers now or i want them eventually.
sorry.
that's impossible. all my stories are bull plop. bull plop!
of course! it's so simple... wait, no it's not. it's needlessly complicated.
no, sir.
look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse.
i'm sorry. what?
huh?
not a chance. no one can silence me, but me!
whuh?
if i know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch. oh, marge. it's me, the real homer!
the dog thinks so... bad dog.
oh, it's wonderful. truly god's country. see you on the island.
okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding. wait a minute...
beer! yes! how did you know?
gee, i wish i could, son, but we've already left the gift shop.
i know that. how much to fix it?
i can't afford that.
he couldn't breathe.
black arts?!
okay, we'll move. we don't want any trouble, fellas.
i know, but which one? sixty cents?! i would've made more if i'd gone into work today!
a good son would come through for his dad!
oh, that's it! you can walk home!
what the?!
who gave you all this money?
really. hey, maybe we could do that again. can you look even more pathetic? oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! we could make a fortune.
there ya go! we'd be stealing from people we know. it's just like the seasons.
i think you know the answer to that.
they have any father-and-son grifts?
interesting.
would you?
you bet. let's trim the mark.
ten-four, kemosabe.
no, no. don't protect him. you'll work off that cake in the acid mines.
a singing rubber fish, of course.
what in the hell are you talking about? oh, right, the magic. the magic was great. it's really... the way to go.
suckers.
dog for sale! dog for sale!
yes, son?
in a way. but i also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. plus the baldness.
hello, is the lady of the house in?
oh, of course, of course. it's just that...
now, you weren't home, so we had to pay the delivery man...
dad?
how'd you get wise to us?
so what's the pitch, old man?
you've just won 10 million dollars from that publisher's cleary-dealie!
he's dead.
i guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
you're right. we'd better just take this check back for shredding.
thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting.
yeah. we're not criminals. we're just two crazy, mixed-up kids.
you'd do that for us?
okay, thank you, sir.
colgate cavity patrol?
yeah, he conned us good. well, at least we still have our jobs at the sweepstakes place. what?
absolutely. we had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... bart, would you call him a crazy man?
well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some...
anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. let's hit the hay.
huh? but that's impossible.
uh-oh.
well, look at that. but who called the police?
let's see how this plays out.
i told you, my memory is fuzzy. fuzzy!
when the time is right...
let's see where he's going with this...
but skinner got shot!
but what about the guy who took my car?
i can't believe everyone was in on it.
wait a minute. you're telling me the police force, the tv news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and bart a lesson?
lenny, are you watching this?
i know!
circus?
but i wanna watch bret favre!
i wanted to see 'em fire a gorilla out of a cannon.
just smash it open!
oh no you don't! i paid full price for this freak show. now nourish the child within me! nourish...
one snow angel, comin' up. ahh, why does that always happen?
my car, your roof. it's only fair.
well, yeah.
i think i know my own life, ned. call mr. plow / that's my name / that name again is / mr. plow.
i hope it's flanders. i'm just kidding. hey, you're all right.
wait, let's just leave it on till we forget our troubles.
i know, ranch dressing. a hamster ball!
we're free! and we've got something to eat. woo hoo!
you're the camel. hey, this car's got cruise control. school, please.
c'mon, kids. let's leave this awful place and never come back.
whuh?
oh, baby!
wait a minute, was that cat making out with that mouse? 'cause if they were...
i'm a little teapot / short and stout / here is my handle / here is my spout.
you're right. that suit gizmo could be worth billions. and i'm gonna get a piece of the action!
oh. yes, of course. uh, she's behind that plant. hello, marge. hi, homie. sign this, please? you're the boss! daddy, ask the man for some candy! no, no, no candy for you. then at least get some candy for yourself. kids.
so long, sucker!
absolutely.
animotion.
yahoo!
huh? what is this crap?
yes!
oh, i hope "plunging" means "up," and "seventy-five" means "two hundred."
c'mon, marge. we're a team! it's uter-us, not uter-you.
you mean, like, medical testing?
hmmmm.
it burns! it burns!
food? i'm blind!
dammit!
well, i'm not sure, but it mighta happened when i was six.
hey, i came here to be drugged, electrocuted and probed, not insulted.
hmmm. increase my killing power, eh? let's do it.
i just underwent a procedure to increase my iq fifty points.
is the capital of north dakota bismarck?
dr. joyce brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect.
it's a date!
everything from hop on pop to death be not proud. it's so tragic, the way they hopped on pop.
better. i was working on a flat tax proposal, and i accidentally proved there's no god.
i am here to give hope to the least of you. because we all have a crayon up our nose. maybe it's not a crayon made of wax. maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice...
yes, nelson?
not being a moron, i wouldn't know. however, .
i've compiled a thorough safety report on this plant.
i've decided to disintermediate the local authorities, and send it straight to the nuclear regulatory commission.
comfy, isn't it?
wait, you can't hate me. i'm your better! your better!
so you all hate me?
hmm, i'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern...
well, what gets you through the day?
a walk? that's a really good idea.
hey, don't blame me. this movie is tired and predictable. you know she's gonna wind up marrying richard gere.
it's bill pullman, you fool!
is there no place for the man with a 105 iq?
that's ridiculous. you do nothing but play god! and i think your octoparrot would agree.
i want you to stick this crayon into my brain.
deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher.
dee-fense! dee-fense!
extended warranty? how can i lose?
we were what what in a what what?
huh? oh, you want a hug. well that, i know how to do.
whuzzit... my juice box!
just give me ten more hours.
oh.
heh, heh. "grill power."
it was great, all right. but all i wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. because when all is said and done... prison rodeo!?
relax, they've got rodeo clowns.
not now, honey. daddy's busy. now, for a little calming blue. hey, where's your blue shirt?
i can't complain.
oh god, my back! it hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!
uh-huh.
air?
there's an air in space museum.
well, there's a dull ache, certainly. and overlaid on that is a club sandwich of pain. only instead of bacon, there's agony. marge, can i have a blt? what are you looking at?
first i'd feel like having a blt, then proud of you.
so? just gimme some drugs and surgery.
yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front.
hey, i thought real doctors hated chiropractors.
less yakkin', more crackin'.
ow! owww, my back. dr. steve didn't do anything.
yeah, right. i did 'em while you were studying.
yeah... in fact... i feel fantastic!
not "trash can," son. dr. homer's miracle spine-o-cylinder! patent pending.
you brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?
hmm. i don't know what that is, so i'm gonna say yes. now, go limp.
next!
boy, talk about irony. the ama tries to drive you guys out of business. now you're doing the same to me. think about the irony...
okay, that should do it, moe.
ah, you saw our bus ad.
we might be able to do business.
hey, where're you going with that?
five? why don't we make it fifty? you're gonna regret this.
wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals...
i can still see your movies, right? ...and i never saw gallagher again.
tom savini?
you're right. gimme a minute. hmmm.
sorry, son.
no problem.
woo! dinner!
aw, now, be nice, moe. this guy just got out of the hospital.
c'mon, you're here to make friends.
i can't decide. i throw myself on the mercy of the food court.
and i'll have the beef wellington.
hey, let's get this down to the funeral home before they try to back out.
oh, the whole deal. coffin. tombstone. anti-stink spray.
what funny names.
that thing got picture-in-picture?
whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey.
okay!
what?!
mr. salesman?
tennis court, eh?...
i'll bet you didn't see that comin'.
of course i do, dad. and if it were up to me, you wouldn't die at all... but try tellin' that to killy mcgee up there. what on earth are you doing?
that's tennis?! then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
and it's bad news for the gophers.
yeah, it'd be nice to entertain friends and have people over.
keep walkin', flanders.
fas-ter.
and how about that stephanie the weather girl?
wow. how do you come up with such witty remarks?
get off my property.
i've had it with that school! door.
i've got it! it's in the bag!
ohhh, well that's bad news for dingbat charlie. he's gonna be crushed.
okay, now some of that is me.
okay, honey. i can see this means a lot to you. i'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored.
don't worry. the tournament's not till tomorrow. okay, get ready for the serve.
how embarrassing. you take over, bart. lisa! lisa, beer me. i'll be right out, honey.
now that's the kinda nagging i can live with. so barney's like "you're on your own, dude," and i'm like "not even."
i'm getting to that.
it's gonna be tough without a partner.
well, good for you! anyone i know?
good morning, partner!
the name of bart's partner? i'm all ears.
no. no, no, no. you're my partner.
nooo! traitors! uh-oh. i don't think they saw me.
don't touch me. your hands feel like salad tongs.
my manhood? i never thought of that!
maybe five bucks would refresh my memory.
who pays for that wedding?
you're right. but just to be safe, maybe i should chain him up.
i think you're underreacting.
badbye. no. no. stay away from my wife, bart.
absolutely, sweetie.
no, of course not. now aim for your mother's heart.
oh, come on. you've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. now serve!
babies.
don't listen. it's a trick!
i think he's trying to psych you out.
well, look who's here. you two are goin' down.
oh, that's loser talk!
unbeatable, eh? comin' through... hey, hi otto... sorry...
hey, that's great. listen, i need a new doubles partner. my little girl's a lead weight.
yeah, but only to crush my wife and son.
booo! you rot!
up- bup...
now lisa, dumping is such a harsh word. let's just say i'm replacing you.
everybody's been dumped but me. i'm undumpable.
you're a girl.
you know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff.
courtesy of pete sampras. sorry. sucker.
a world without krusty -- what would that be like? what's on tv?
oh, yeah, uh, i was at the flower shop today, too. yup, gettin' drunk at the ol' flower shop.
take it off!
go. blow.
38! that's roughly my age! marge, after a lot of thought, i've decided to run the springfield marathon.
let's see. sweatbands... check. anti-chafing nipple tape... check, check... and check.
i can't believe it! i'm actually running a marathon! oh, i hit the wall! this is so painful! hey, i got my second wind. another wall! i ju-- woo hoo! third wind!
and thank you for assuming we're hip. all right, now here's the 411: i'm a record producer, see. i'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for bart.
and my dream is to get rid of bart.
will you two shut up? i'm missing precious vj prattle.
ah, it doesn't mean anything. it's like "rama-lama ding dong" or "give peace a chance".
here comes the jealousy bug. gonna git ya! gonna git ya!
i wanna go home now.
'bout time.
smelson! it's funny 'cause you smell.
am i ever!
kids... how would you... like to go to... blockoland?!!
i am a robot. do what i say. i am a washing machine. do what i say.
check it out. i built myself a healthy apple.
yep, a shiny new apple. i get it. everything's made of blocks. even the water.
what are you gonna do about it? uh-oh. leeches!
it's what i always tell them. i told them that twice yesterday. and then again as they were going to sleep.
you're right, honey. hear that, kids? the simpsons are going to blockoland!
'scuse me.
yeah, you're right. but before i go, i'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own.
you know, standing up for the little guy felt good. i'm gonna do it more often.
my heart was in the right place, jerk!
well, you're welcome, honey. now, i'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. got a problem, bart?
don't worry, son. i'll handle this.
well duh! he's breathtaking, but bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent. and face it, you're no prize either. you wear braces, you dress like a kid and you're not gettin' any younger. take what you can get.
they wouldn't? well i'll go to bat for you, honey.
nice place you got here. ooh look, a hair net. be a shame if it was hurled to the ground! oh, how clumsy of me? and... oops!
either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed.
wait a minute. four hundred a month for loafer lightener?
you get the same results with a mincing gel.
the satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks i et cetera.
say no more. i'll help you, lenny.
is...
i see.
i'm sorry to hear that.
yes, sir.
albuquerque isotopes? what is all this stuff?
what a crazy room. there's no albuquerque isotopes. it's the springfield... ohhhh.
you're moving the team to albuquerque, aren't you?
well, okay. but you can't silence homer simpson. i'm the friend of the downtrodden. and i'm not gonna forget what i saw here today.
oh, my head. how long have i been out here?
i was? but i love the swing.
you know me. occasionally, i'll be quirky. "i'll be quirky..." albuquerque! i'll be right back!
yes, that is an important story. but so is this!
that's it! i'll go on a hunger strike.
so? i can stop. and i will stop. i'm on a hunger strike, starting right... now!
my hunger strike will not end until duff admits they're moving the team. bart, my chains. now it begins.
man, he really hates wayne rogers.
hey kid and man! don't support a team run by liars!
they're secretly planning to move to albuquerque.
why you little...
nice try, god. but homer simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... hey! stop that!
do they have to chew so loud?
why do you look like cesar romero?
why are you here?
but i wanna!
me so hungee.
so hard to resist. mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeño relish... wait a minute, those are southwestern ingredients!
tell the truth! c'mon, everybody!
don't listen to him, duffman. for once in your life, stand up for the little guy!
what can you do? sex sells.
they said if i come in late again, i'm fired. i can't take that chance.
you read my mind. sooo... this coffee's good, huh?
you know, i think our marriage is...
no, i do!
you...you really scared us.
that's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
noooo! this is such an eye-opener. i always pictured the kids dying in the living room.
mm hm. hmmmm. we don't need your high-priced safety junk! thank you.
she will be.
now do you realize how unsafe the american home is? baby accidents occur every three minutes.
yeah, but this is me talking. look, i already encased the telephone in concrete.
baby could order poison.
of course you are. marge, i've finally discovered the reason god made me: to protect his tiniest, most breakable creatures. and i've got to share that gift with the world. get her outta here.
yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round buddha.
so am i, but i don't get all huffy about it.
that's me! safety dance! you can dance / you can dance / everybody look at your pants.
dear god, what have i done?
woo hoo! simpsons rule! sorry.
so all her bullying was just to get some attention.
pound that nerd.
well, okay, but get five bags in case we eat four on the way home.
in the cart.
cart.
woo hoo! y'know, i always felt sorry for marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun.
the customer's always right. that's what everybody likes about us. now mush!
hurry up. i can't stand here jabbing you all day.
no you don't...
oh, the bag boys are on strike! i'm shaking.
if i can have this rubber stick.
good boy. good boy. show us where the food is. where? over there? hey! yoink. my old lunch box! that amos burke made his own rules. very old animal crackers!
mmmm... turbulent. ow! what the hell?
your box made promises of a vacational nature. and i expect you to live up to them.
ow! my eye!
woo hoo! hey, mister?
on the plane, i'm gonna need two seats... for the twins.
that's okay. i got 'em. eh, bound to happen.
wowww... it just rolled over to ten thousand.
what did you just see, lisa?
what did you just see?
i've got more bones than that guy. if you're trying to impress me, you've failed.
you have failed.
by the way, what kind of blood is this?
yeah, it's like the allman brothers!
it's working! leeches!
i've got a map! monkey. now, according to animal crackers, there's no river here.
here's why they shouldn't get anything. one...
not a chance.
i told you, yes. now bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel.
go.
or... more mouthwatering monkeys. overtime for bag boys? ridiculous!
so, i notice your home smells of feces.
you must be the most boring woman on earth.
i mean i knew scientists wasted their lives, but geez.
anything for these noble animals. so like us...
somebody light this monkey. help! bad monkey!
hey, look! our tour guide got a new job.
i was wondering what became of him.
now he's just a stinking flight attendant! hey, where's my pillow?
breakfast! aww... cereal? you know i like my breakfast fried or chicken-fried!
well, let's put him to the test. me love beer.
aw, he loves beer. here, little fella.
ooo, can i have a brownie?
ooo, can i have dinner?
comin' in from the left.
or is it the right?
look out for the reach-around! he shoots, he sco-- my thumb! oh god oh god oh god!
sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, marge!
come on! come on, boy! oh, please give it back. you want people food? i can get you people food. i have nothing he wants.
give me back my thumb! gaa!
okay, if the doctor asks why you cut it off, you caught me in bed with four beautiful women.
marge, over here.
symmetry, eh?
thanks, moe.
well, i really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... although i do like the occasional beer...
can you drive me to shelbyville hospital?
no, lisa, but i sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast.
i'm sorry. i thought he was a party robot, like in that play i wrote.
my thumb!
quick, moe! marge cut off my thumb.
thanks a lot. now i gotta walk to shelbyville.
what the hell...? linguo, dead!
oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!
one tower of babel, and build it to heaven. to heaven! christ be with you.
he can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. and there's only one way to find out. does -- rachel -- like -- ned?
flanders has cooties, flanders has cooties.
hey, she's coming this way!
ooh, she wants to know how your life is going.
he can hear you, rachel.
hotel? why don't you just stay at ned's place?
yeah, maybe it was too soon. well, aren't you gonna invite me in?
say bye, mr. flanders.
sure, of course i do, but life goes on, ashes to ashes, turn, turn, turn, long live rock, and so forth.
man, this is taking forever. i know how to speed things up.
now for the awkward part. we gotta talk about money.
what? that doesn't sound like me.
hey, how 'bout that?
you're doing that the sucker way. try a little vitamin g.
relax. it's a "controlled burn"... uh-oh.
uh, yeah, teenagers.
i am. i'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.
no problem. i'll need a sack and something sharp.
oh yeah, those guys and their crazy scams.
do i detect a hint of cinnamon?
oh, why not? everybody's doin' it.
stupid grill! why won't you light? the gas is on full blast!
good idea.
could get hurt. could. there's a chance they won't. ned, praiseland has touched an entire town with its inspiring message and toxic super-freakouts. look at those smiling faces. rich laughing with poor... bullies breaking bread with nerds... orphans lighting candles over a leaking gas line... lighting candles!
ooo, ned, look who's here. it's that girl you don't like... not!
i think ned is gonna be all right...
you got that right
pick me! pick me! i've got hoop dreams, coach. i've got 'em bad.
lo-sers!
okay guys, i've got a secret play i've been saving for the olympics or possibly the final four, and it goes something like this... uh, skinner i want you... moe, you can take ... homer, you can take groundskeeper willie. no way am i taking groundskeeper willie. yes you are. are you a team player or not?
eat my dust, mortals! i'm okay. ow!
did you say anterior?
hey man, you're harshin' my buzz. anyway it all started when...
jet-son!
maybe a little morphine would get me there quicker.
miss work? but my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
two weeks?! well, what am i supposed to do? just sit on my ass and watch tv? that ain't my style, man!
no they don't.
i'm so bored.
oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. stupid flanders.
well, they would keep me company. and this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal.
sure, knock yourselves out, and call me homer.
daddy's not here, is he?
that is the darnedest thing!
hey, it was fun. my kids are sick of all my stories. but they just can't get enough of me!
don't tell me what i'm not doing.
oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
then i'll do it, just to see the look on your face. that's the one.
see for yourself.
sure. go for the gusto.
it knows you're afraid.
aw, aren't they sweet. any medical things i should know about?
wonderful. being with those kids gives me a high only morphine can top. ya got any?
peek-a-boo!
okay. is that all there is? / is that all there is? / if that's all there is / my friend / then let's keep dancing...
yes, but then i discovered the joys of raising children.
aw, that's my girl.
is there a snack table?
don't film this.
'cause the thing is, there are no bad kids...
my kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always loved.
yes, through the magic of caring.
please let me win this, lord. 'cause if you don't...
yes! all my love has come back in trophy form.
i almost had a straight!
hey, what's the deal?
well, i'd rather reserve judgement until i... oh my god! that is completely taken out of context! why you little...
no! no! no one is taking my kids from me! run, children! run!
i'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
uh oh.
well, i learned my lesson. from now on you two are the only kids i'll care about. oh, and maggie. now let's all enjoy the snack table while we still have it.
yeah, that'll happen. teamsters.
hey, wait a minute. "airport tax, five dollars?"
well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. waive it...
what are you gonna do to us?
all right, but your next story better be worth it.
a poor delicious buffalo. he'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.
i haven't had buffalo in six hours. marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-o.j.
what have i done? what have i done?!
aww...
i liked that story 'cause i was a judge.
i'll meet you in wilmington.
oh, it shows. i was gonna say something, but i thought it might sound you know, weird.
and it's important to feel good about yourself... okay, spread your toes. do you know how much glass is in here?
the perfect crime. marge, i have to be in court next tuesday.
a fortune teller? oh, no you don't. this phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. see, this wart is a fake!
so much for the legendary gypsy hospitality. beads! owww!
hey, that's me. and that's you.
good as new. well, i... there. right as rain, there.
guys, i am not cursed!
oh, moe, they're dead! and it's all my fault! when did that happen?
ah, 'tis like the singin' of the angels themselves.
i know you don't remember me, but here's a little revenge, irish-style! yah! wake up, ya lousy drunk!
ew! nasty!
yep. everything worked out for the best.
well, me saying i'm sorry won't bring him back.
mm, various eggs.
trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!
oh, i agree.
yeah, that's the price of success.
keep 'em comin'.
yeah, she's cool.
lucky, shmucky. i knocked her up. but she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. but if i died, she'd be completely free. for man or machine.
yep, a machine.
well, i am missing the back of my head. i think you could cut me some slack.
oh, i'm gonna enjoy this.
yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special...
my sweet little angel!
didja hear that, pengy? forty dollars!
end of the line, boys.
judge snyder? while we're young?
i'll bring the car around.
uh, your honor, i was chasing the kbbl party penguin prize patrol.
and a blue oyster cult medallion. coooool.
your honor, if i may sing a little bit of "don't fear the reaper", i think you'll agree that...
i couldn't agree more. perhaps some sort of court-appointed baby-sitter or au pair.
tethered?!
room five?!
it's a little tight.
i used to be.
bo-ring.
come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff.
fine.
cobras!
that's my boy...
sure, boy.
oh, son. you know that's none of your business. say, is that our house?
oh, yeah... i forget things sometimes...
since when?
all right, all right. come on, bart.
that's my little slugger.
hey, knock it off! these pants cost six hundred dollars!
moe? what the?...
it's about time. oh.
well, that's a pretty big "if," honey.
oh, i just got comfortable. use the bottle.
fine. i don't even know why we have a bottle. somebody tell me!
ah, son, it's a little chilly. maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head.
what's the big deal? he sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
why not? kids are very visual these days.
hey, shut up.
ow! why you--!
because i... ow! you--!
ow!
heyyy, how 'bout that? ha, ha.
but, constance, it only happened because...
wait. i'm to blame, judge. you see, i was pressuring my wife to make love in front of our son... you're gonna laugh when you hear this... when suddenly...
i admit it.
dammit!
well, that explains the sign.
you're right. it's time to stand up to that firm-breasted judge.
shhh, you'll wake up flanders...
well, we tried all those other tools.
woo hoo!
okay, she lives at one ocean view drive. let's start skulking. it's only the milkman. hey, maybe i should be a milkman.
this address must be wrong.
i know, i know. fight the power.
cops!
i hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her.
oh, it's just a friendly seal.
uh-oh.
hey, how ya doin'?
so... it cost you nothin'.
that was close.
the bridge column. oh, that south. you never know what he'll do next. hm... aw. look at that dad in "drabble." he's like an unfunny version of me.
probably digging for drugs.
no. of course not.
yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?
maybe i will.
very little. i'm having chest pains! where's the defibrillator? clear!
you callin' me a liar, carl?
oh, i just naturally assumed.
now, ya see, that's what i'm talkin' about. you're always pointing that shotgun at us.
maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
that was an amazing throw.
hey, where'd that painting come from?
can do. now don't you worry about a thing.
no moe. you've got it all wrong. people buy beer from you.
i thought you said you had to go.
oh, i don't know. what would moe say about that? but on the other hand, moe's not here.
don't worry. you gotta hit it just right. like fonzie. ayyy! oh! whoa! hemorrhage-amundo!
ayyy.
i don't get it.
what's the gag?
moe? wrecking moe's bar? wow, well i i almost fainted, but then i didn't. what are you doing?
and it would look pretty, too.
hi, formico.
sorry. he seems nice.
wow, it looks like an alien headquarters. couldn't you just see aliens runnin' out of there? couldn't ya? hey, wait up.
not for friends of moe's.
don't you know who i am?
cecil is a girl's name.
ah, whatever. just give me a duff.
ah, whatever. just give me a duff.
okay, look cool.
that's it! i'm gonna tell moe exactly what i think of his...
oh, so you're ashamed of us. well, you've turned into a big phony.
i'll throw myself out, thank you. i believe i had a hat. suckers!
i think it's pretty obvious. i'm turning our garage into a tavern. the kind moe's used to be.
it's not about spite. it's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor moe. now help me nail up this urinal. beautiful.
'cause moe's a big jerk and a she-male too!
barkeep!
it's the family bar. right, kids?
as soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
i told them it was a benefit. they think they're saving the rainforest.
seems to me i already did.
bar? i see no bar. this is a hunting club...which is permitted by state law "to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."
which i'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy.
it's the law. my hands are tied. okay, cranberry sauce, stuffing, potatoes. come on, turkey. join your friends.
i would.
here, turkey, turkey... turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey... nobody's gonna kill you.
a cougar! die, cougar!
oh, no! this time i really am gonna faint! son of a...
i'm sorry i shot you, moe.
hey, who invited the hippies?
all right, i'm sorry... but i will not save the rainforest.
and here you go.
ah. and now to read my fortune. "geese can be troublesome." what the hell is that supposed to mean?
well, i knew that before i came in here. a guy outside told me that.
oh, these fortunes are terrible.
easy.
you will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
okay, let's see... "the price of stamps will climb ever higher."
stop that dog! it has my gum!
ummm...
oh! yeah. monty's a wild man! yeah! oh. he ran his own casino, stole the loch ness monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun.
c'mon, he's a total player.
windowsill.
you're right. these would stop joan collins herself.
yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man burns.
yes, mr. burns.
oh, sorry.
but mr. burns, you're exhausted.
can i have some ice cream? i finished my pizza.
you're going to ask her to marry you?!
are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
let go of her or i'll scream!
ohh... geez, i just wanted to escape.
pistol whip?! mmm... pistol whip.
you know what would be surprising? a foot massage.
good fire. good fire. keep burning. almost there. just a little more.
wow, mr. burns, how did you do that?
what about the wiener? a guy on tv lifted a can of paint with his.
oh, i know.
marge, a bee almost stung me today. i felt the wind go right by my ear.
ooo, that's quite a hug, honey... hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! well i can fantasize too. ooo, mama celeste.
love? "signed photo"?! marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! well i'll show her!
hello. this is chad sexington, the model for burly paper towels.
perfect. i'll be there at seven.
i was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of chad sexington. do you mind?
tonight? well, you better get your hopes up.
that's him.
it was hard on me, too. i had to wear a suit. oh, you're right. i've gotta make it up to her.
how about benihana, where dinner is the show? no, huh?
yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings.
zing! what's a skeletor?
look at me, i'm a famous historian! out of my way!
look at me, i'm angie dickinson! out of my way!
i'm twelve years old... i'm with my friends. it's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... oh my god!
oh, that's better...
hm, twelve... well, i remember i used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. with these two guys.
wait a minute. i remember falling in the mud, but i don't think that's why i've been screaming...
something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
it's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses...
bye, moe.
never!
someone's yellow belly is showing.
and it's empty. put it back! i don't wanna see it this way.
ooh, a movie! i call the couch!
now the movie's turned into a play! still good, though.
why? he'd just bury it.
seems kinda pointless now.
when you have a rib-eye steak / you must floss it / oh, that meatloaf tasted great / you must floss it / now floss it, floss it good.
just a second, son. i've gotta put on my contacts.
science!?
mmmm, pie pants. this is launch master homer, counting down. five, four, three... two... one...
i have eyes, don't i? i would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good.
son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of god. five, four, three, two, one... countdown!
okay nibbles, you can guide her down. step one: right in front of you is a blue handle. pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds...
you say that so much it's lost all meaning.
'cause he's all man.
quiet, lisa. everyone in the store is looking at you!
i don't know how to feel.
hold that thought. bacon up that sausage, boy.
wha?! that's it. no more chat rooms for you.
i think this tree could use an angel.
i don't know what santa left you. i just know his name is clip-clop and he loves sugar.
so you're back on the winning team?
that's all i ever asked.
no problem. there's plenty of activities inside.
the tv!
oh, we'll see about that. one, two, three.
i'm good for the rest, you know i am.
they told me it would be like this on the outside.
why you little...
you got that right.
stanford.
a heavenly choir. you must be an angel!
no, you are an angel like denzel washington in "the preacher's wife," or will smith in "bagger vance," or slimer in "ghostbusters."
well, not with that temper. look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. marge, bart, girl-bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. how i loathe him.
...which is society's fault because...
me. / right here. / oh, me too. / please.
cooperate?! this is one family that doesn't swing that way.
okay, family huddle. here's how it's gonna go down. as a family, we drive away. we cover for each other -- as a family. it's what gabriel would have wanted.
okay, but talk like this.
what?
oh, no! the roast beef is making them stronger -- and the falafel is making them angrier!
wolves and cougars ate our roast beef!!
i knew it!
yep. our family is as functional as all get out.
give it to me, baby.
marge, i'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. liquors drunkened me.
look, i did marry her, but i abandoned her. amber, tell her how i abandoned you.
look, i married her, but that is as far as we went. we never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee.
oh, yeah... oh, that's good... oh, don't stop. oh, yeah...
talk about what? sports? bigamy?
not a sports fan, huh?
you know, there are only so many times i can say i'm sorry and still mean it!
i would if it wasn't for the kids.
you know, she could put that mole anywhere on her face.
to amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.
woo hoo!
i don't know.
she said "tavern". i'm going to moe's!
peace, my people. all shall be looked up. let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. one hundred and sixteen.
no, the best book you've ever seen is tom clancy's "op center."
i've used up all these records.
the simpsons are goin' to mars, so pack your... or maybe i'll think of something else.
fine, i'll just play the banjo with this cobra. wait, wait, wait...
but it's my banjo.
yeah, they're called "congress".
group stunt?
denver?
we're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!
okay. lemme check the specs. wow, my vision is coming to life!
woo-hoo! in your face milwaukee!
now that everyone's so open about being fat, i can finally stop sucking in my gut.
yeah, you can't improve on nature.
wait. you went to a sugar factory? were there oompa-loompas?
it was dinner.
i was hoping we could do that together.
oh, i am so proud of you.
get in the car.
part of me knew that.
i'm with you all the way. but first...
count fudge-ula? i thought you wanted to get off the stuff.
oh, you mean tennessee?
kinda. come on! give it! i know, i'll try reverse psychology. i don't want that stupid map.
that wasn't part of the deal!
has everyone keistered their personal supply? 'cause i sure haven't.
no way! we'll defy you to the death!
let's do it.
before i bring the sugar in, i want to see the oompa-loompa.
no marge, i love when you do that. you're a regular carin' a-lot-ovich.
that's what i told lisa!
i'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. show the movie!
i'm not scared of those ushers! what are they gonna do? advance on me?
so long, suckers!
broken jaw?
i'm horny!
nicely done.
i was just tellin' all the guys how losing the power of speech made me a better man.
sure thing, alky.
ostrich burgers! get your ostrich burgers!
okay, you pick one out and i'll punch it to death. dude, i thought we were friends. i'm not proud of that clip.
well, i don't know. the demolition derby is next month...
well, okay. for you i'll be as dull as dilbert.
yes, and i was merely reading the title: "i'm gonna kill you." yep. nothin' to get excited about.
professor van doren, so good to see you.
i just poured myself a new glass of milk. the old one sat out for a little while. are you comin' to bed?
marge, i could stand here and argue with you, but then i'd have to get a new glass of milk. goodnight, honey.
but bold moves are no longer my forte!
oh, what do i do? what do i do?
quit banging my wife!
looks like i need some fuel for me mule. gas for me ass. aw, looks like a little angel. now to save me marge.
here's to a happy, well-rested marge!
unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
what's goin' on?
hey marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya.
it's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs.
hm, a million dollars? wait a minute. how much sex would be involved? 'cause if it's "some"...
if we had artie's money, i could get that snoring surgery. plus at least two of those other surgeries i desperately need.
one squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
uh huh.
wait, you really think marge is gonna fall for this guy? even after i bought her that hockey-fight tape?
oh god, you're right. i've gotta get her back before it's too late. that's enough running.
just for twenty-five years.
my life here is over. lenny, how'd you like to leave town with me, and never come back?
then it's settled. we leave springfield forever.
i saw something terrible, and i can't even say it so i'll have these two dolls do it for me.
i'm leaving you, marge. the next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. don't worry about the kids -- i'll drop 'em off with patty and selma. patty and selma? screw that! just run the camera, you little... goodbye, my darling.
this job'll be perfect. i'm gonna leave this world the way i entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman i love.
marge?!
why? so i can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? i don't think so. good day.
we said "good day"!
oh, i can't take his money... i can't print my own money... i have to work for money... why don't i just lie down and die?
goodnight, honey.
no. the olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!
you wait 'til next month! you wait 'til next month!
ten-four, princess. is that your beer tent? ow!
monkeys cry.
don't worry, honey. we can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, i promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is. in south carolina.
you will too!
look, boy. here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like "jumbo" or "boxcar" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy... what the hell is that?
wow, what kind of mileage does it get?
yeah, one time, she-- oh, she's looking at us. be cool.
that i do, sir.
i have a boyle on my ass.
cockfight.
canada? why should we leave america to visit america junior?
all right, son. we'll all go -- first class!
would a u.s. dollar change your mind?
there she is, boy.
listen to me, son. no one loves a quitter. so you go over there and you win her back.
oh, i quit. there's no convincing you. i'm gonna take a nap.
really? ooh, this i gotta see. oh, he just wants to make friends. ooh, who's a good dog? what a goody doggie! oh what dee de bobo! echee chee googie!
he's a good doggie!
hey boy, where'd you get that hat?
no kidding? hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks.
swell.
because i want to be your hero. on top of which i don't look bald.
one of the wheels broke off my chair today. but i didn't make a movie about it.
can't keep it in...
i've seen drunker.
for shame!
well, i thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?
yes! my son lost his hero. this should be the greatest night of my life. how come i'm not happy?
nice old man. don't break a hip.
mmmm, something smells delicious.
get me buck mccoy.
that hurts. but i just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
aren't you forgettin' someone?
and don't you forget it.
not now, marge. i'm waitin' for the new xfl season. who will win this year's million dollar game? who? who?
the "x" is for extreme!
and he never even lived to be a vegetable.
oh, my dad never even knew how i felt about him.
sure, i said i loved him. but never that i was "in love" with him.
aw, dad... we've got what people never get, a second chance.
you sunk my scrabbleship!
tell that to the good men who just lost their lives. semper fi.
you? no way. it's too dangerous.
that was a d.w.i.
dad, get up.
no way.
oh, no. i'm not giving you my car. you'll probably drive it.
wow, a booth. if i'm tired, i can just lie down!
in real life he would die.
hey, watch the movie.
lisa doesn't borrow my car and stay out all night with some... hoochie.
straight up, marge. that hoochie only likes you because you can drive.
no, he's gotta learn, marge. the way my dad made me learn.
cosmic.
and another thing: no death races!
oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father.
uh, we'll wait for the next one.
only in public.
overdue book?! this is the biggest frame-up since o.j. wait a minute... blood in the bronco... the cuts on his hand... those jay leno monologues... oh my god, he did it!
oh yeah, i checked that out when bart was born. i was gonna read to him every day.
that mini-van had the biggest cup holders. and change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!
fine. it was the end of the trojan war. clever odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the trojans once and for all...
stupid king of troy. i think i speak for all the greeks when i say this war has gone on for too long.
anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. we hope you don't have a horse.
forget it. sacrificing animals is barbaric. now have the slaves kill the wounded.
gentlemen, i must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me.
boy, if they kiss as good as they lure... wow!
almost home!
those were my friends?!
that's it, i'm going home. which way to ithaca?
this truly is hell!
honey, i'm home!
quit suffocating me. i'm going to moe's. oh, here's the story of joan of arc...
this one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called "france..."
victory? we're french! we don't even have a word for it.
burn this guy! he lost our good bucket!
i don't know, but that would be hot. "once upon a time there was a young prince of denmark."
it's cold outside. you'll need a sweater. a sweater!
son, it's not only a great play, but also became a great movie. called "ghostbusters."
now that's what i call a moon shot.
boy, did you make a prank call to brazil?
choke on your lies!
which phone company? there are hundreds of them. and they all keep changing their names.
we are not paying this bill.
marge, it's called negotiating.
i told you, i have too much time on my hands.
why didn't you call me?
that's it. they have awoken a sleeping giant.
the one i didn't make and marge didn't make and bart didn't make and hence no one in the house made.
yeah, the one we both like.
don't you know the boys from brazil are little hitlers? i saw it in a movie. whose name i can't remember.
no way. i still haven't lost the weight i put on from the last one.
then it's settled. the simpsons are going to brazil.
the simpsons are going to antarctica. next year. this year, brazil.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. so in august... it's cold?
and in february... it's hot?
so hot snow falls up?
woo hoo!
forget every word, boy. it's useless.
wow. it's like he's on the dashboard of the entire country.
look marge, i'm brazilian.
i got it, i got, i got it.
hey, and a mini-bar hat.
...i will eat this toblerone / and i will not pay!
ooh, they look like skittles.
now lisa, it's not as bleak as that. can you fly me over town to look for him?
oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?
but you're on vacation, honey. i'm not wearing my wedding ring!
does that include tip?
how did you know?!
mine keeps disappearing. oh, well. i hope they're goin' somewhere good.
sweet. sweet! sweet! ahhh...
so that means i don't have to pay the fare.
woo hoo!
fine. take me, but let the boy go.
eh, same old garbage!
what?!
i'm sure he'll turn up. look, here's one of his buttons.
it's a murder, honey. a group of crows is called a murder.
drop it in, don't cram it in. oh, forget it, i'll do it myself. awww, look, maggie wants to fly too.
all right, that's it. shoo, you stupid crows! shoo! shoo! shoo! that is not a worm.
hm, fascinating. say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?
does it go in the butt?
look, man. i don't do drugs.
for me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight.
but isn't marijuana, or "dope," illegal?
smoke on the water / doo doo doo doo / doo doo doo doo / doo doo doo / doo doo
marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal. i could walk up to the president and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
hey, it's me. i got marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out.
i didn't. but now daddy's special medicine... which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. ever.
sh-sh-sh.
oh my god, this dude does the best flanders! you got the mustache and the didilly... okay, now do wiggum.
now you know what i've been goin' through.
oh man, this is long. could you read it to me?
wow. wow. god does so much for me. and he doesn't ask anything in return.
done and done. now, do wiggum.
oops! i thought this was the can, man.
you just said it!
you're covered with a very fine fuzz.
whoa, whoa, one question at a time. yes, you?
look at shemp! he is so high!
and "otto" is "otto" backwards.
as soon as i graduate, i am so outta here.
we gotta get out and stop that initiative. marge, i'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos.
'cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!
whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented "the matrix," medical marijuana can make things fabulous. medically. so my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on tuesday the seventh...
well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands. although, wow!
eyes? what the hell are you talkin' about?
never!
get out.
oh, yeah. get out.
going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.
as a reminder, marge. y'ello.
but i can't find you funny anymore.
this stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows friends. but i promised my family i wouldn't smoke it anymore. start inhalin', waylon.
you mean that guy on 60 minutes who yells all the time?
so what? mr. burns is dead.
mr. burns, may i field that one? it's true we're losing money... but there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away.
and you wanted to take him to the hospital.
waiting for my wife. she has a surprise for me.
don't you have criminals to catch?
my father and i were never really close. i never found true happiness until i met marge. and life just gets more exciting. then came the day that changes every couple forever. the day we got our elephant. while i wait for my family, i'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss.
ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together...
all my other senses are getting sharper. bart, you had pizza for lunch. lisa, you're extremely depressed.
are the proceeds going to charity?
woo hoo!
that was at my expense. what kind of a roast is this?
i'm sick of your lies. secrets and lies. it's always secrets and lies.
stupid lawn chair! come on... unfold you... ow!
this'll teach that stupid chair. i'm on fire! oh, i hope no one's drawing this. ow!
i hate them so much!
that guy's hilarious. i especially like his white shirt and blue pants. wait a second... angry dad is me!
leave me alone!
that's just so obvious!
i'm just passionate -- like all us greeks.
oh, i am... oh my gosh, you're right. i'm a rage-aholic. i just can't live without rage-ahol!
i said anger.
i gave up anger forever. from now on, i'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers.
hello there, flan-didly-danders.
well son, i wanna show you how grateful i am. let's go fishing.
i love you, boy.
stop it now.
i need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till i tap the keg.
thanks. are you sure you don't want to come? in a civil war reenactment we need lots of indians to shoot.
oh my god! i know you must get this all the time, but can i suggest a flavor?
grape.
she likes you! put in a good word for grape.
okay, okay, don't go mary todd on us.
mm-hmm!
this was supposed to be a mock battle! mock! don't worry. i'm just gonna drain the area around your wound. so cold... so cold...
now, you just take the kids home. i've got to return this keg.
why do you always take the side of local merchants?
in my role as customer, i saw the whole thing.
dirty love. i mean, thirty love. i mean, anyone for penis? i'll just get the shuttlecock.
he already knows. let's tell krusty.
that guy's hilarious. his reaction would be priceless.
okay, this isn't easy, so i'm just gonna come out and say it.
i saw you and that squishee lady -- canoodling like junkyard rabbits!
yes. you are scum.
mmm, caramel baloney.
you bet i am!
u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
and krusty. we gotta invite krusty.
yeah! 'cause if they don't...
uh, we didn't order that. can i lick your fingers? meet me at the mail slot.
it's where i got this!
hey, apu, i think she likes you.
whee! whee!
i bought the issue for richard avedon's pictures of lenny.
woo!
it was magic. he took a cockney flower girl and turned her into my fair lady.
here you go. don't worry. i soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.
are you okay, lisa?
aww, she must have dreamt about hitler again.
hey, where's my keg?
i take a whiskey drink / i take a chocolate drink / and when i have to pee / i use the kitchen sink / i sing the song that reminds me i'm a urinating guy! flex! flex! flex! flex! flex! flex! flex!
against my wishes!
oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. but if a woman did it--
oh, come on-- you're right.
i was trying to throw bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree. marge, where's my pellet gun?
guys, i just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond.
certainly, lenford. make every day a celebration of your love. surprise her with a pasta salad! put a mini-beret on your wang!
hey, hey, hey, no peeking. happy anniversary, marge!
aw, the poor thing's in pain. what he needs is a visit from kindly old dr. foot.
are you sure god doesn't want it to be dead?
if he wants to sleep with us, forget it.
once upon a time there were three bears. the end. oh fine, i'll go back to the beginning. oh no, i crushed that horrible bug. what should i do?
uh, he's sleeping.
uh, they discontinued the cobbler.
now let's not get into who smells like what.
but what about the axe?
eh, you're the shut-in.
my pleasure.
and i can ride my bike real fast.
hey, i'm not running an employment service, you old ba-- oh-ho-ho, you mean me? i'd be delighted.
laxative?
don't worry. you're gonna be just fine. i-- o-kay.
buh... guh... muh... wuh. zuh.
without a trace.
oh-ho, so it's a good thing she died. from our point of view. financially.
book 'im, lou.
you'd be dead a million times.
oh man, what a day. i'd kill for a beer.
i'd stab somebody for a pickle. gimme some peanuts.
what? it goes right by our house.
here's my underwear drawer.
you know chief, if you let us go, there's a diamond necklace in it for you.
don't worry, marge. i'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. i know who stopped up the toilet!
let's just say i'm planning a little surprise for the execution. this cannon is going to be full when i go off. ka-boom! y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side...
just think of them as twinkling stars.
i want to confess. i killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. marge is completely innocent. the only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder i did.
now you do it for me.
what?!
i knew it!
this whole thing was a joke? oh, i've never been so relieved! relieved and angry.
well, i'm glad everyone's all right, but i think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for tv ratings.
so hot, so sticky... marge?!
lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!
jingle bell what?
a blackout?! every time santa and i get together it's a disaster.
no.
no! i've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that santa claus. no more irresponsible behavior.
all right, but not the imported. you've got to set limits, marge.
yeah. wiggum couldn't catch cooties at milhouse's birthday party.
i admit it. i did screw up, but i won't feel guilty until i can put a human face on this.
marge, doesn't lisa have a human face?
see, when you don't use milhouse, it's hard. i love this kid.
exactly. look at him over there, eating that apple. what's he planning? what?!
to people?
people with heads?
did you steal dolls from my daughter?
well think again. son, you're going to juvie.
aw...
hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. and i felt like a big man pushing that kid around.
cheese!
oh, well... heh, heh. hm... oh, i'll... no....
how 'bout lenny?
you'll do as i say or i'll have your badges. once i make and give you your badges.
who said it was a he?
who said you did?
is this you? if it is, don't dial nine one one. simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two.
have no fear, springshield's present!
the only friend you need is springshield.
you know, the old lady's apartment was actually lenny's. we just used a different duvet cover.
even dessert?
what a character.
well, according to this, he's tellin' the truth.
all right, fat tony. your little game is over.
shut up, flanders. anyone else? what about you, dr. hibbert?
after everything i did you're going to abandon me?
what, and let them come after you and the kids?
in one car? with no air conditioning? and the little poop machine going every twenty minutes?
yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. and if you kill him, someone'll take his place. and that's pretty much the end of it. the town'll be yours.
yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. i'm giving this badge to the next guy i see.
i must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.
aw, she's taking a nap.
oh, i'd love to, but someone made me too many pancakes and now i have to sleep them off.
were they now?
the hammock man! i'm glad he's a little early today.
you had me at comfort.
clone?! that's ridiculous. where am i supposed to find a... wait a minute. wow, four of me. i think this could be a magic hammock. and it just might be the answer to my problems.
uh-huh!
man, are we evenly matched.
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
ned...
twenty-three. now, today i'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with bart and girl it up with lisa.
anybody else? anybody else? come on... okay, everyone out!
you'd think so, but no.
noooo! we're out of donuts!
good news.
not mr. blasty? it's okay, boy. you'll be shooting angels in heaven.
marge, let me do a solo. this could be my big break.
gimme!
hear me, people of the past!
i come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. grab your guns and follow me!
oh, how to explain this to a child... hm... future daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- get 'im!
hey, i've been around scotsmen.
hey, i'm on vacation.
you mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?
bring back some ice.
uh, i really don't wanna do that, ned.
fine.
you know, you're not helping.
what's that?
eat... my... shorts?! why you little... maggie! lisa!
what game?
manimals, invertebroads! you must fight back against the one who did this to you!
what the-- where's my money?
and you can live with that.
fine. there are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.
lick 'em. go away.
jewish? oh, no, i'm not jewish.
oh. ah, i don't care about the color of your skin, lenny. you're my friend!
oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya...
i've had just about enough of you.
i'm outta here...
moe's tavern.
what? wait a... that can't be right! wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?
if i was that drunk, i would remember it.
couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?
and that's why you're my favorite. all right, time for my favorite show.
i don't remember anybody telling me i was gonna be on tv.
yeah, i'm pretty great...
oh, i can't believe they took "monkey trauma center" off for this. lousy family...
a hot babe...
oh, i don't resent you, sweetheart. what i was trying to say, and maybe i didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go...
oh, what have i done?
you can't just leave me out here! there's not another woman for miles!
"the rolling stones rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!!" but i thought you guys were mad at me. for once in my life, i'm confused.
damn straight.
you what?
what was that?
omigod! omigod! omigod! it's mick jagger and keith richards...
woo! std's!
to rock!
uh-huh. now i'm afraid that if i stop talking, i'll die. isn't mick cool? i thought he'd be all like, "i'm a rock star. aren't i great?" but he's just like you or me or jesus over there.
out of my way, nerdlinger.
here you go.
ooh, i'm telling mr. jagger.
mr. seltzer?
no, i think it's seltzer.
i came up with a stage move i feel is very cool. baby, baby, baby, baby!
sorry mick!
bor-ing.
but rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
precisely.
i got 'em! i'm entitled to a private life! i'm not a role model! and so forth.
really? you really think i'm better than you?
what the hell are you doing here?
it's been a week already?
noooo!!
i knew nothing!
never! my dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. i was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. i'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing.
i'm so despondent.
but i like it...
can i have forty guest passes? woo hoo!
all-access.
and after the show, you can come backstage for pizza and pop.
oops, gotta run. enjoy the show.
i'm ready. just give me a guitar. how many solos should i do? four? i'll do four.
my official tour jacket! look at-- wait, they misspelled "guitar hero."
can't you do it? oh. okay. so i'll, uh... okay.
test, test...
test... "test test, you're testin' my love for you, check check, you're checkin' to see if i'm true..."
baby, baby, baby, baby, baby... uh-oh.
oh, yeah... when you've been in as many as i have, you can sense them coming.
what am i, the lost and found?
well, you're very sweet, mick, but the only rocking i want to do is in my living room chair, surrounded by the world's greatest back-up group, my family.
nah, i've got something to remember 'em by. have fun at school, kids.
rock and roll! woo hoo!
i've grown, you haven't.
marge, we can't pinch pennies on the machine that's going to be raising our children. come on, kids. daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk.
woo hoo!
no problem.
i bet you would.
mmm... feed...
kids, kids, you're both right.
put pie here.
me not pig.
hey, you can't fool us. we're from the "learn to fart" state.
well, what about bart?
well, he's not gonna get very far without that. bart, is that you?
and maggie, you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing bart and lisa.
not if i can stop that inauguration!
let's hear it.
you know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself.
well, if bart can be "el barto"...
huh? oh, right. can you hold it?
my real ring's inside a turtle.
can i help you?
... and that's how my beautiful wife brought our son bart into the world.
hey, why would i want purina when i've got fancy feast right here?
aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. well...
did you label the meals so i can tell which is which?
explain later!
yeah, he truly is a monster. hey, let's go out to dinner tomorrow. just you, me, the kids and the twins. whadaya say?
well, that cinches it. lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response.
that's not true, lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song. you took a twenty-karat diamond, and made it gleam / like a big spaghetti dinner, smothered in whipped cream.
and they're all mine...
forget it kiki. you're not putting your brain into her body.
no dice. take your fun and adventure outside. wait for what? confirmation of my attitude?
shut up, boy.
with the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup.
kids, i'd like to reintroduce you to classic marge.
not at all, sweetie. at least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one.
oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling.
let's go get fried chicken!
d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
woo hoo! i got skybox tickets! and with only twenty percent loss of my brain function. life is...
check out those non-skybox losers, watching hockey without sushi. if you can call that hockey.
fine, watch your stupid eagles concert.
whatever.
because she took the trouble to wander away and talk to a stranger.
hm. better add some more nails. perfect.
i go by how funny the sign is.
don't worry. we'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. the time will just fly by. eh, that was boring. let's get a hotel.
stupid bran producer's convention.
i know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, lenny.
so how do you afford such a sweet pad?
who wants to eat a loser?
1895, forget it. we'd be too late to save lincoln and too early to save kennedy.
it's not a time machine, moe.
where's that kid with my latte?! he's not coming, is he? is he?
oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, lisa.
finally, i'm no longer a slave to the gillette corporation. why, it says here that president cleveland has...
all right, let's take that...
all right, let's see what we've got here.
you've been in there over an hour, boy! other people have to confess too, you know. oh, i can't hold it in. i hate this house!
look, we can't give up. we're on tv. and when you're on tv, you dig in your claws and you never let go. just like bill moyers!
oh, i wish you would reconsider the proposal of hiram beatwife.
i would never sign that! unless there was a red sticker that said "sign here."
where do you get those things anyway?
our lives are ruined!
i can't remember the last time i cried like this.
savages! i'll handle this, marge. we come in peace. we takem your land.
wow. marge, i think i figured out their primitive language!
and now to wreck their precious helicopter.
yeah, but... okay... oh... that lenny sure had a crazy apartment.
that's it! tv was the one good thing in my life and now i can't enjoy it any more.
if we formed a club we could serve drinks.
good idea, lisa. hm, the water's off. i'll use my eye to see what the trouble is. hm, off again. maybe i can hear what's going on. so, this has become a game of wits, has it? perhaps my other eye will get to the bottom of this.
mail call!
don't struggle. you'll only sink faster.
do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition. wait a minute, i'm not wearing a shirt!
mmm, steamed gentile.
triple, no. definitely no.
you'll understand someday when you have kids.
wow, you don't even have to point it at him.
hmm... well, there's mr. burns, fat tony, the emperor of japan, ex-president bush.
pbs, stephen hawking, the fat little dixie chick...
gotcha.
i just wanted to impress you.
mardi gras, eh? didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?
uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, i'd like to buy a copy of jugs and ammo.
just fix it, mr. sasswrench.
right, right. i'm countin' the pennies in the ashtray. there's two!
you're so smart. shock him.
ooh, someone's coming!
once i kill you everyone will think i'm the real homer!
guys, bob is my only hope. back off and give him some room to think.
very well. i am gone! don't look at me!
right here.
marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen.
nonetheless, the people have spoken.
marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a tuesday.
but i'm not drunk!
oh my god! attention drunken idiots: this is your king! sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
they're not for dudes!
don't be so sure. i've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.
we're up so high. where could that shot have come from?
not anymore!
frank grimes...
frank grimes...
oh yeah. how is old grimey?
we know. frank grimes, jr.
yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. goodnight, son.
bart! turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
goodnight, sleepyhead. do you have to poop?
which i did. mm... trophy.
disney world?
gator gulch?
wait a minute... i know where we're going... oh, it's horrible...
i wouldn't have it any other way.
hey skinner! do you and edna want to join marge and me at "great moments with mr. eisner"?
oh, you mean the enron ride. let's go.
who will take home the rampy?
michael jackson just told me to shut up!
what a rip! you all should be ashamed!
well, here's ours. we're going to disney world!
oh, it's so beautiful. one churro, please.
lisa, nobody likes a shill.
i love that little shill. let's get her that diary.
watch and learn. more free samples.
eh, it's still better than indian food. one turbo diary, please.
lisa's not gonna want that. oh, what can i get her?
what are you buying? jerk stuff?
hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. maybe lisa will like this better than the diary. stupid flanders, you're a genius!
i think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
but it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- lisa simpson.
still? then you're not gonna like your other present.
maggie, you're her best friend, go talk to her! oh, what have i done? children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?
oh, lisa's still mad at me.
but i'm full of questions. what's your favorite cigar size? is it robusto? is it?!
oh, my daughter hates me because i don't know anything about her.
well... if hiring this guy will make lisa like me again, then i'll do it! can i get this beer to go?
ooh, pie.
how did you know?
priceless. i need you to find out everything about my daughter, so she'll think i'm a good dad.
anything to trick my daughter into liking me. now, if you need to reach me, my email is chunkylover53 at aol.
it's one word.
dot com.
you should know. it is your favorite album.
wait, wait! i thought you might like to go to an animal rights protest today.
on the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!
well, we should get along. i mean after all, i am your... ...father.
mom? don't you think i could read the report by myself?
uh, report is a daddy word that means "loves his daughter."
that's right, honey.
a forty dollar steak?!
you've been living like a king on my dollar... super unleaded gas... silver bullets?
i can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
you'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
i look just like elvis!
uh, rock strongo.
uh, lance uppercut.
let me just put on my glasses. you're charging how much for a room?
oh, marge. you're not gettin' it, it's me. homer. simpson.
lisa, i can't lie to you any longer... this is all my fault. i'm the worst dad in the world.
the man who framed you is a crooked detective. who i hired!
to find out everything about you so i'd seem like a good father.
okay, i'm coming right out the door. dammit! these windows are so hard to squeeze through!
oh, a banana! it's full of cigarette butts. so is this one...
we'll just tell the police and then i'm back to being plain old rock strongo.
dexter colt. the man who framed my daughter.
oh, lisa has excellent hearing. once when she was three, i was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!
how ironic. now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there...
how the mighty have fallen... into my price range. i wanna go there! woo hoo!
no, i'm good. hey, your early porno movies! are any of these hetero?
got any junk that will go up in value after you die?
the weights that changed you from a bavarian creme puff to a mass of twitchy muscles?
i'll take it.
your heartbeat is so soothing.
oh, like i'm gonna kick chief wiggum in the groin.
now dr. hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.
don't worry. everything is fine. what the hell is that?
don't worry, i'll set fire to the hive.
run!
yep, but you're still safe at home. after a few practice trips here, the real kwik-e-mart will be a piece of cake. now, bart will play apu...
look, i'm the first to admit it. i don't write good parts for women.
then we'll have to smoke her out.
bart, eat your spinach.
yes way!
it's like we're at cheers. i loved that show. because you always knew it was only a half hour till "wings." then you could just sleep till monday.
no, actually, i'm going to eat twice as much.
alright mom! / yay, mom! / woo hoo!
marge, that was amazing! it's like i'm married to shaft.
i'd rather talk about our feelings. i feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. rebuttal?
your mom has a lot of stuff to shave. ow... ow... ow... oww...
quiet, her muscular ears can hear us.
oh, i'm so proud of you, honey. you bulked up, but managed to keep your femininity.
sorry, sir, sorry.
and i miss being your knight in flabby armor.
good. can you wax the car? ow! ow! ow! i'm kidding! i'm kidding!
yeah, well, nachos are nachos.
wow, i wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that. mmm... farfetched.
yes...
woo hoo! huh?
well, i guess flanders doesn't have all the luck.
it's not fair. i always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
the grass is actually greener on flanders' side.
no that's not it. he's got some secret. and i'm gonna find out what it is, no matter what it takes.
so that's all it takes, a little prayer.
ugh, where's the remote?
die, monster!
it worked! i got my wish! from now on, i'll pray till my hands are chapped and bleeding.
o lord, please guide that diaper into someone's schnozz. yes!
you know, i used to think god only helped professional athletes and grammy winners. but now i realize he helps shmoes like me, too, carl.
can and will. now to un-stop this sink. lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. then take some time off for yourself. fly to france. have a nice dinner.
oh lord, i see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, marge. for thou art most wise...
marge, he's way the hell up there.
well, we could live with a stopped-up drain.
it wouldn't be the first time. i couldn't help it. those pews are so comfortable.
can i borrow your pen to sign this deposition?
i can't see anything in this fog.
woo-hoo! can i get that in lottery tickets, please?
look, this church is our only option. don't you kids want to live here?
the dog's on board, too. aw... he thinks he's papal.
sweet.
we'll just see about that.
she went to lovejoy's temporary church. she's worried about her immortal soul.
eh, god's cool.
oh look, god's giving us a little shower. everybody, look at the much-needed rain. thank you, god. now turn the rainwater into wine.
i guess i learned something here. god is capable of great anger and great mercy. but mostly great anger.
i was going to tell you on my deathbed.
la la la la la la la la la.
la la la la la la la. nothing left. la la la... la... la.
i needed it. i had to buy back some incriminating photos. look. see. you're fine. and then--oops! uh-oh. look out... i know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, daddy's a hero! see, bart. i saved you.
that's right. you're mine till you're eighteen. and when you're seventeen i'm gonna know the end is near, so i'm gonna work you like a dog.
yes, son. at times like this i just look at my bracelet.
jesus?! i thought it was gepetto! who is it?
well, i'm not opening the door.
but not too crispy. see you in court.
emancipated? don't you like being a dude?
hey, my dad was lousy and i didn't sue him. i just dumped him in the cheapest home i could find.
why you little...! um, i'm sorry, judge. that's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor.
son, i just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, i'm gonna be the best dad i can.
woo hoo! you're still mine! and you thought i was a bad dad before.
mmmmm... garnish.
what the--? half goes to bart. half goes to my vegas wife. what's left for moe?
go ahead, leave. you'll come crawling back. that's right! crawling on your knees! crawling! oh, he's really gone. he's gone!
did you see that, boy? your mom thinks you're still here!
for your information, i've been taking steps to become a better father. for the past week i've been carrying around this bag of sugar. it's taught me how to love and care for a child. what the-- where the hell is my sugar?!
hello, son. you're looking well.
so, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?
psst, mr. hawk. may i have a word with you?
sure. my son is bart simpson and...
sorry. i just wanna win my son back so badly.
groovy.
all the work?
i'm challenging you, hawk. in front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who can't even get into the army, if you can believe it.
not very!
aw, that's the dumbest thing i ever heard, you stupid little kid.
finally, someone explains it to me in words i can understand. look, boy. i know i did wrong and i am truly sorry. i put you in humiliating commercials for money, which i spent on myself. i just wish i had an opportunity to make things right.
anything... as long as i can give the money to my son.
well... i am bald and important. where do i sign?
wow, i can't wait to pack that into my colon.
i got arm veins, don't i?
mars, eh? hmmm, i see no evidence of water.
the ribwich! the commercials have come to pass!
i could lick you all day long.
one ribwich please. hm, now without lettuce.
i have eaten the ribs of god.
hey, who doesn't?
oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. only very serious daddy business can tear me from your side.
wow, this is amazing. i could follow the ribwich from town to town.
maybe i should hook up with you guys. after all, how long do any of us have to live?
you monster! why did you expel boogerman?
i'm sorry, honey. i can't be here tomorrow. it's the last day the ribwich is in san francisco.
you don't understand. it's not just a sandwich. it's about brotherhood. it's about freedom. it's about three days since i've had one! i'm getting the shakes... and i'm getting the fries!
this can only be good.
hey! don't borgnine my sandwich.
welcome to the real world, hippies!
lisa? is this what i've come to? fighting over a stupid sandwich on my daughter's big day? mister, i'll take that car.
daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!
damn right honey. you're number one on my menu. now super-size it!
it came out again.
enough talk. dip me, my love.
i know, and it doesn't get any easier from here. there's the tongue-kissing festival... cinco de ocho... the hobo oscars... days just made for lovers. not widowers, lovers.
flanders?! can't a man just drink alone on a wednesday morning?
sara sloane? the movie star?
flanders, i mix twinkies and ding dongs all the time. in europe they call it a dinkie.
now wait just a minute -- i used to worry marge was too good for me. she was always thinking of ways to improve me. but then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. so we're all where we want to be.
who the hell is mr. flanders? oh, flanders. hello? yes, i'm ned flanders' close personal friend... that's right, hot and heavy... they've never been happier. oh yes, i she does look pregnant. now, who might you be? a tabloid? is that one of those really strong mints? hello? hello?
moe, what are you doing here?
stupid flanders. i'm not giving you any of my secret moves.
look, flanders. i'm always interested in talking about free milk. and if there's cookies involved, so much the better.
poor ned, gardening away his misery.
droll. mmm... promo. ew, fox!
marge germs!
i'm gonna go calm my nerves with a nice relaxing shave. tissues please! get... out of my... airspace!
i'm on my way. you man the rake.
never! stay plugged in! i will find you! now cookie, do you think you can sell this house?
see, it all works out?
make that a chocolate milk and you've got a deal.
that's a great idea. why didn't you say something before?
i see a bad moon rising...
looks like we're in for nasty weather...
i guess there's only one way out of our problems: a murder/suicide pact.
it's just an expression, marge.
bo-ring!
let him speak!
krusty, you've let everyone down. and even worse, you've let down this sacred document.
stained with the blood of american patriots.
yeah. and to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
beat it, waxie.
sir, i studied under ed mcmahon!
how 'bout before?
that's right. over the homes of poor people.
oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire.
children, so naïve.
i didn't say anything. so naïve.
but it's st. valentine's day! god wants us to do it.
well, my special mix tape will get you going. oh, no! that's maggie's mix tape! then maggie must have gotten...
everyone but me.
dr. hibbert? you're the teacher?
aren't you gonna chuckle?
you know everything about me!
wipe me down and sign me up!
you're preaching to the choir, man.
oooh, published by kinko's!
yes!
yes!
god yes!
it's the sound of a go-getter at work, marge. look, i installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are.
and now to see mr. burns for the promotion and raise i've deserved since this morning.
but the book said you would applaud my initiative.
yes, sir. ahhh, look at the little eels. electric eels!
thanks for trying, but i'll be at moe's.
moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years.
revenge? on mr. burns?
no, i think this calls for something a little more cerebral.
mr. burns! the nuclear regulatory commission is here for a surprise inspection!
hello!
hello!
hello!
that's right. and as my first act... mr. burns, you're fired!
no, it's entirely within my power. furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. check and mate. now, king me!
huh?
mr. burns?
hey, that looks fun! do me!
unlike mr. burns, i will respect you, the working class slob, because we are all equals. and now, as i ascend this crystal staircase to my office, i say: avert your gaze!
you're right. put two walnuts in there.
sweetie, these things are gonna take time. i just found the door-shutting thing. oh! oh, yeah.
can't i water ski a little bit?
no deal!
that's great, honey. hold it up to the camera.
look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. i f... ...best quality pork chops.
well, i have to work, but give the monitor a kiss.
c'mon, boy. you're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor. hey! that's a printer port, not a finger hole.
hey, honey. sorry i'm so late. i had to lay off twenty-seven robots. don't tell me they can't cry.
mr. burns! where's mr. smithers?
i don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. i don't even want it.
there you go.
from now on, my only ambition is to be the world's greatest dad.
quit crowding the plate! oh, you want a piece of me?
talking won't get you there. lisa, what's bumming you out? they cancel a test or something?
it's a concern. a serious concern.
sweetie, daddy doesn't have enough money for that...unless they take a check.
boi-oi-oi-oinggg!
i have to go.
oh. well, where do i twist this thing to make funny patterns?
you may be a smart kid, lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings.
mmm... bad eggs.
i'll bet somewhere there's a horse drinking coffee.
don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?
aw... my baby's first words.
night... glorious night...
i hope it's as fun as pictionary was last week.
what? are you sure?
oh, i hate this. it's making me use my arms. hey! these two pieces were already connected -- we're halfway there!
can't help you -- all i got is gray. anybody working on a cement wall?
it's how the pros do it.
now let's see. this is either an old coconut... or tom hayden.
it's the only worthwhile thing i ever made that wasn't lisa. prove me wrong, silent bob.
looks like you're missing a wife.
i can't believe how young we looked... in my memory. hey, there's writing on the back of this. "dear homer, i can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life."
the only dangerous amount is none! let's go to ihop! i'm drivin'. okay, burger king! whatever! c'mon. why did she stay with me if she hated me so much? hey, two days later she had a doctor's appointment. nausea... cravings... knocked-up feeling... she was pregnant with bart! and that's the reason she stayed with me.
how 'bout that?
oh, the popular singer slash songwriter slash puzzle piece.
yeah.
whatever.
marge... did i ruin your life?
no, the voters will decide that in november. i was talking about this.
quit changing the subject. how do you feel about me right now?
so you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?
fine. i'll go sleep with someone who does appreciate me.
that was a muffin!
oh, so you don't like it when i drink. what other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?
oh, i didn't realize you've been counting the years. is it that horrible living with me?
it is to me! marge, i can't live like this! i'm tired of walking around on eggshells.
now you're just making up rules. who made you judge judy and executioner?
no, no. this is nothing like milhouse's parents. now if you need me i'll be staying with milhouse's father.
you don't have a doorknob.
stupid flanders with his misleading silhouette. well, i guess i have no choice but to go back home and... hey, i never noticed that newspaper box. "apartment finder: we put you in your place." "roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!" thank you, news box... it's gone!
what's the deal with this place? it's so manly, yet scented.
me too. i'm a member of this club where if i eat one more sub sandwich, i get a free sub sandwich. you probably saw the ads, with this guy who used to be fat, but now he's just ugly.
are you trying to tell me that you guys are those guys that like guys?
you are? hm, which will win out? my old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that i've already mixed my laundry with yours. i'll have to sleep on it.
calm down, picky ricardo. he made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way.
way ahead of you.
i see.
marge, please. let's not fight in front of the kids. just secretly hate me the way you always have.
why you little...!
well, i'd better go. but before i do, marge, there's something i want to ask you.
how much do you tip a leg waxer? i need to know by tomorrow!
the kids are cool, but marge is still judging me.
maybe it is. i used to look at marge and get the same tingle you guys get when you see rip taylor. but now, i don't know what's gonna happen. c'mon, let's dance.
weird al yankovic!
did you ever get the parody songs i sent you?
which one was better: "livin' la pizza loca" or "another one bites the crust"?
yeah, like you and allan sherman.
i don't know... date a chick with kids...
all right, all right.
margarita... that's mexican for marge. i'll take that as a sign!
you guys don't have a gay time machine, do you?
sorry i'm late -- the velvet mafia made me a margarita i couldn't refuse.
wow. wow. i never realized you felt about me that way. we should really take some time to talk and...i'd just end up hurting you!
oh, yeah. the night that destroyed my marriage.
you have that on tape?!
marge, i never want to be apart from you again.
that is the best kiss i've had tonight.
manly thoughts.
those suck. they're worse than nothing. i could write way better songs.
flanders, i am a patient, reasonable, handsome man. but even i have my limits. now beat it!
he's the man that i hate best / i'd like to see his house go up in flame!
hey, mister? if you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? it's already rewound.
fine.
ned's a stupid name! he's worse than frankenstein or dr. no.
don't yell at ned!
his wife is dead! everybody hates that stupid jerk!
he's your perky, peppy nightmare neighborino!
me too -- i've come to hate my own creation. now i know how god feels.
well, i guess we could afford one nice trip.
what? it said "take one."
sweet.
those poor hats.
coming, sweetie!
can you shoot one where i'm rambo and my wife is betty boop?
you people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. if i get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?
three.
deal. my brother...
so long, suckers! stop shoving! the little one isn't getting any.
/ let's see move that there... do a flanking maneuver there... wind should be coming in from the south... time it to coincide with a beaver holiday... this map is useless! useless!
uh-oh! we forgot to empty the mini-bar! that's a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!
fresca?!
i still hate them. go back to pittsburgh!
who is he?!
only if it's an affront to god.
only losers buy wood. we're going to nature's lumberyard.
it's okay, bart. this track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh.
did frank lloyd wright have to deal with people like you?
i was just puttin' words together.
well, two can play at that game.
stop it!
son, that treehouse is gonna be bigger and better than ever. it really restores your faith in helpful weirdos.
watch your step... don't panic... by going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue.
move the net under the window.
quit following me, you coward!
all my life, kent. i prefer "catsup" to "ketchup." and to me, "yusuf islam" will always be "cat stevens."
kent, let me make this perfectly clear. i have no dog.
fine. i want you to just sit there, look through the window and watch me eat a ham. marge, prepare the emergency ham.
i don't care if his name is bony mcdork, just make the checks out to me.
corporate jet?
who are you, my biographer?
boy, you're now second best in the family, right ahead of marge.
kent, let me make this perfectly clear. i have no dog.
my wads! i never even broke the wrapper.
a plan, eh? okay, we'll use a plan.
help! help! i'm drowning!
everything is going according to plan. i'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.
now let me think. how did that beautiful young naked lady in "jaws" make it out alive?
marge, they're just hams, okay.
to me that says "i love you."
aw, it was probably that stupid cat.
what has he done for me lately?
everyone's against me.
bart, are you okay?
hey, take it easy. i went to the video store, to rent a movie for the family...
that monkey's wearin' a hat.
can i get a phone that plays the mexican hat dance?
i dance, i dance, i dance / around a mexican hat / i dance, i dance, i dance / and that's the end of that / or is it i guess i'll keep singing / my cell phone appears to be ringing...
hands-free, eh? then i could give the brothers the black power salute. black power! black power!
uh... a lighter.
that reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in shelbyville.
i didn't want them to know my size. thanks for picking my friends up from the strip club, marge.
public transportation is for jerks and lesbians. i guess i'll walk.
you know, i feel pretty good. maybe i should just keep walking instead of going into a dark, dreary bar.
you see? before, i probably would have driven to the syrup.
calm down, stresserella!
now now, honey. we all appreciate what you do. but real chauffeurs have uniforms and licenses. you could get in a lot of trouble with the livery commission.
marge, you don't know what you're saying!
i said, "bishop to queen four."
thanks, mr. burns. i owe it all to walking.
honey, you seem frazzled. why don't you come with us?
you sure love driving.
yes, i strut down the boulevard / burning off my excess lard... i rarely feel the need to utter d'oh! top of the mornin', ladies.
i can walk from springfield to alaska / then hobnob with the stars in malibu...
the guy who got fed into the wood chipper in "fargo"? and when i hear...
i say "of course i can -- screw you!"
pretty good. thanks for asking.
it's okay, marge. it would have been a lot worse if i hadn't been carrying this bible in my crotch.
too hot! too hot!
hot! hot! hot! warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!
marge, you're trying to hurt me!
no, it's true. the car, the soup... it's like you hate me... your own husband...
i've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but i never thought i'd hear it from you.
who's "we"? got a mouse in your purse?
there's homer... homer j. simpson... and commander cool, a/k/a me.
we've gotta help her. if marge isn't happy, i'm not happy. and if i'm not happy moe is very happy. but for once, this isn't about moe. what should i do, dr. hot dog?
you mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
i see. do you have any suggestions?
gotta go.
i'm gonna treat marge to a romantic dinner, to make up for all my shortcomings.
you can bring a bag of ice.
honey, i couldn't keep 'em away if i tried. except for flanders. he was mysteriously called out of town.
so i threw you a fancy banquet / and now you can't stay mad / how 'bout a make-up snuggle? / it would be so rad.
so you don't want to kill me anymore?
why you little... now, let's all raise our wine boxes... to marge!
you're welcome. and now marge, we cooked, you clean.
and now, to all my dear friends, i say... get the hell out of my yard.
i never knew you were such a beatles fan.
it's not all his fault. i blame this latchkey kid.
look at me, i'm brian epstein! now i'm michael jackson. i own all your songs, losers. hee, hee, hee.
hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. "cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."
you mean like some sort of madman?
i'll do it! i will now give each of you your specially selected tribal name.
let's see. what native american activities should we do? making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the civil war.
without the talking stick, we don't hear you.
but i was chosen by the great spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, i'll be at moe's talking normal.
hey, treadmill! how do you like this incline? uh, i'm giving it back to the earth.
marge, you were an excellent peace-time chief. but these times call for men of cruelty. oh, it's too tight! take it off! take it off! take it off! men of cruelty.
wait a minute. how could those stupid jar-heads win?
well i'm not finished. where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?
marge, remove that stitching.
people will do anything a sign tells them. boy, that slaked my thirst. or did it?
how come lisa always gets to pick the family activities?
that's because there were seven apostles.
boy, that's a big staff. and still he wasn't that funny.
stupid prey. they never suspect anything. ooo, a hotdog!
your baby!
moe! thank god you saved my baby...
oh my god, i'm late for work.
yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. she--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!
i said, pipe down, amtrak.
back off, moe. maggie wants to be with me. this is how we play. the squirmy wormy spider / squirts out of daddy's hands...
i recorded that for private use!
that's it, moe. this is just too weird. you are not allowed to see maggie anymore.
get out!
get out!
yeah. you know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own.
it must have been moe!
i'll get our little passports.
oh my god, i've gotta save her!
we're not. your sleeve got caught on that tree. here, let me unhook ya. off you go.
or worse, am i right?
you kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! eat fire, punks!
never! beat the lumps. beat the lumps. beat the lumps.
death? we don't want any.
this is for snowball one and jfk!
nooooo!
i'll curb him... without enthusiasm. ooo, this robe's pretty soft. check it out! i finally found a dead guy's clothes that fit me!
no way. forget it. i might occasionally kill out of anger, or to illustrate a point, but i am not a grim reaper. ow! i'll reap! i'll reap already!
never mind. i'm death now.
i'unno.
come on!
woo-hoo!
i'm gonna not kill you every week.
if i say no, do i still win?
i wish i was death again. that was cool.
it was those guys!
just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?
lisa!
okay, that's good! stop there!
yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! like getting the rat out of maggie's room!
whom? whom?
honey, this is your moment in the sun. and i couldn't be more pleased for your happiness. why was i born?
gotta win a t-shirt. gotta win a t-shirt. okay, get ready to laugh! cranford man missing. what's he missing? his pants? a train? gimme a break! too soon, huh? all right. "drought threatens to turn west into dessert"? yum, yum. i think i'd like some whipped cream on my wyoming!
from what, too much hot fudge? huh? c'mon bart, show me some love!
this is what happens when i go for six hours without sleep. "peace talks break down." no. "for sale, ford festiva..." i'll put that in the "maybes." i gotta get that t-shirt. world's biggest pizza?! oh my god! marge, wake up! the newspaper is talking to me!
all right, i will. that's why i don't listen to my brain. and away we go!
you have no choice.
they all do.
hey, the bathroom's a block away.
i know! i'm working my way up to you.
i think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.
you sure know me, mom.
i made this when i was five. i had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
fine.
now, i'm not a man who's good with words...
i barely know my mother. and every time i see her, she's taken away again. and when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me. i mean, i'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. hell, i torched a blood bank. one cookie my ass! please, please, give me back my mommy.
oh mom, i'm so happy! i never want to let you go!
dad, you testified against her!
look mom, look! i'm riding by myself!
you weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and i want you to see it.
now get out of my house.
how do you figure?
you're right. people should only be let out of jail on technicalities.
candlepin bowling? that's a great idea. we'll play right after i break your grandmother out of prison.
mom, i love you! i can't let you go to prison!
no, you're my mother and i won't leave you!
yeah, that did mess me up pretty bad. but i'm not gonna leave you.
go mom! you can do it! nooo!
i couldn't sleep, because i thought there might be a sign of my mom in one of these articles. they never did find her body.
aw marge, i bet you've gotten that out of your system.
i'll put everything on lucky seventeen. woo-hoo! woo-hoo! woo-hoo!
i win! this is it, baby. first thing tomorrow, we're getting a playstation one!
but i'm up two hundred thousand dollars! give me my money! you think i won't manhandle a little boy?!
la, la, la...
my name is nelthon! i use a thalad fork. la-dee-dah! i wash my face!
clothesline.
i wish i'd married a businessman. then i'd have nice things.
on my chess set, the pawns are all hamburglars.
lisa, you've got to stand up to these guys. and when you do, people will remember you. just look at these postage stamps. there's bugs bunny... fat elvis... autumn in new england... bats of the southwest... all heroes. wanna see elvis kiss a bat? hey baby come here lemme kiss you... squeak, squeak, squeak. no, don't kiss me.
no way! i'm saving for a speedboat!
i'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! you can't go to that school!
are you crazy? i'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!
i'unno. how 'bout a horse whisperer?
over my dead body!
one thousand dollars. do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?
it's bart's moon party from outer space... what?
we've gone on plenty of great vacations.
i still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
well, i'd like to return to brazil. but i hear the monkey problem is even worse now.
would an american dollar encourage you to leave us alone?
the place i was born is now a gator farm.
wow. i can't believe we met mr. bean.
make with the tea, jeeves.
aw dad, i wish there was something i could do. touch that mini bar and you're dead!
fish? i don't know, i'm not really a vegetarian...
that was over soccer results! can you believe they gave giggs a yellow card in the box?
i understand the word "gave." unless it means something else in this country.
you can't bet on my kids. this is america, pal!
what? what play?
you mean "macbeth"?
what? by saying "macbeth"?
mr. macbeth, i'm really sorry.
yes, this trip is entirely uneventful.
i see an opening.
your majesty?
wait! we have to exchange insurance!
your honor, i've completely disappointed my wife. that's punishment enough. you understand these things, you're a grandmother.
ohh, and a very manly one, if i may say so, m'lord.
boy, she's good. if she were a hundred years younger... and i were a hundred years older...
oh marge, i am so sorry. i should've listened to whatever it was you were saying.
a secret tunnel? i don't know. won't that get me in more trouble?
okay, what do i do?
sweet freedom, here i--
see ya in atlanta, jerk!
lady, you're gorgeous. you make dame edna look like a dude!
flow... yeah.
bart, we made her the same thing!
mmm, moses.
how dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?
yeah, it's impressive. but i still haven't found the perfect gift for marge. only imperfect stuff for me.
wow! i never thought i'd say this, but you slags are all right.
whoa, marge, get a room! hmm, dare i pour caramel over the cotton candy?
this is eighty-five pounds of tooth-melting sugar. dig in! that's it, kids. suckle daddy's sugar ball.
that's my old lady. ants! birds! cats! flanderses!
maybe you're right, marge. or maybe you're right, candy ball. no, marge. then again... no, marge. definitely marge.
i did a lot of stuff today. i went to starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape.
choke on your candor!
it's a deal!
why does a bear need a crowbar?
can i fight human-style? by slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile? you cowardly swede! you face that bear like a man, or i'll never speak to you again. but how will i find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?
finally, science has joined forces with revenge.
check it out, ladies. the suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack.
i know. if i get really scared, i don't want to ruin the suit.
lisa, the point of moby dick is "be yourself."
fine. but do you know how ridiculous you look right now? marge, you awake? marge?
gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him.
no way. if something happens to me, you have to carry on the simpson name.
suh-weet.
wrong again, liberal media.
don't worry, i'll find you someplace safe.
what can i say? i love nature... circle of life.
sweet.
now calm down. i'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
the door? now i'll never get to pee.
you just lost a box, pal!
you're on!
i'm your man!
welcome to the homer simpson show. i'm your host, next card. homer simpson it's great to be here in next card. springfield my guests are...moe szyslak, local businessman, carl carlson, raconteur, and lenny leonard, three-time juror. gentlemen, what's on your minds?
ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? theaters... airplanes... why even here. look!
why so formal, lenny? you're my go-to guy.
interesting...
please welcome my newest panelist, disco stu.
my pleasure.
yes, you're right... duck, mr. lincoln!
well, i took bart's advice last week, so i guess it's lisa's turn. now, if you'll excuse me... you hit him high, i'll hit him low!
well, that's all over now. from now on, we will focus solely on important issues. every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger. yet, the imf insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules.
i'll audience you!
will you make my sundae for me?
i'm hungry. are they married yet?
then whose garter is this?
i love the holiday season. see you in spring, toes!
oh carl, you remembered i like tv!
oh yes, i am... your present is right in the other room. come on machine, take my dollar! fine, we'll play it your way. here you go, lenny. may the spirit of retsin be with you all year long. god bless god, amen.
oh c'mon... mr. burns is way more selfish. that evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass smithers...
joe dimaggio?
hey, everybody! we're going shopping at the springfield heights promenade!
i'm upside down so much! oh, if i buy this, i won't have anything left for a christmas tree...
that's the birthday i'm always forgetting. i must have it!
uh, sure, you know it. the biggest tree from the finest lot in town!
exactly.
oh, it just needs a little love. why do the things i love always burn?
uh... woo hoo! maggie's talking!
there's a trickle-down theory here. if i'm happy, i'm less abusive to the rest of you.
that's not true. i cared what you thought once you found out.
can't you yell at me now and get it over with?
mr. mcgrew! i love that blind, senile old man.
i heard you the first five times.
oh my god! it's like looking at a cartoon version of myself.
c'mon, death. leave mcgrew alone. take tiny tim.
unloved by al? noooooooo! unloved by all! noooooooo!
children, children, what day is this?
marge, tv and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. from now on, i will stop being selfish and start being good. in fact, i'll be the nicest man in town.
yes, but this time i'm sober. ish.
no need, flanders. i've already given them my old clothes. good-lookin' group.
you're welcome!
all right, now you're startin' to creep me out.
i'm not looking for glory or wealth. i'm just buying that stairway to heaven jesus sang of.
get back to your bong, hippie.
just like the pope! being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner. and here's another act of christian charity i pulled out of my butt. i built a skating rink for the whole town!
ewww.
i'll show flanders. i'm gonna get everyone a car. what's that one good american car?
uh... is it despair?
hmm. you've given me a lot to think about.
um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?
wait a minute, everyone! there's your christmas up there!
let's just say that on this day, a million years ago, a dude was born who most of us think was magic, but others don't, and that's cool. but we're probably right. amen.
and now, i think the only thing left to do is -- return all your gifts! ned?
whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop! whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!
then why did you appear in it?
maybe she was you and you're not! how many kids do we have?
wrong, lady! oh wait, the baby.
and i promise this rock is gonna weigh you down for the rest of your life.
honey, no one messes with my mrs. i'll come down on those guys like the garage door on bart's bike.
you just leave everything to homer. and now, i believe you owe me half a sandwich.
here comes my commercial. in six, five, four...
either way. the important thing is the system works.
marge, wait. i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am.
what do i care?
bart, that creepy kid's here!
yeah, the kitchen lady's right -- no new bike while your old one still works.
that's right. no questions asked.
there, there. you're both right.
for true, son.
i can make a bike. i made you.
hey, that's gonna win you a lot of bar bets some day.
son are you okay? i brought my home-made first aid kit. it's spring-loaded for quick access!
first of all, thank you. secondly...
oh, the beer's gone. i'll have to suck it out of the shag.
like a dog. or a snowman!
"...i'd love to be with you, but i just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. will meet you later. love, dad.
doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...
various bug bites and wounds. now stop interrupting your brother.
i like you, son. not so rough, bart. daddy can't handle so much love right now.
well, i've been busy, son. they really need me over at the nuclear plank.
i don't think so, son. but on the other hand, i may be closer than you think. so much metal in my eye.
uh... i just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
i wish i had bullies like you growing up.
you think you've got problems, look what i just pulled out of my arm!
the business of being a dad. can you hand me that magnet? can you do my back?
affirmative.
you really think so?
and i'm the luckiest--
hey, what gives? he's not killing me!
bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside.
keep me focused.
yeah, i'm pretty unreliable.
great. and i'll have a diet coke. deep fried.
i had a car!
we'll clean out those stupid americans. ...you probably want to talk this over, so i'll leave you two "alone." excuse me.
they'll be back. he was my best friend. cool, an ambulance from the '60s! i bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. injured hippies!
i'll do it!
maybe on planet zoozoo.
kids, kids. those aren't your toys. they're to keep daddy asleep and awake. i'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.
slow down, picasso! you were gonna start a novel without informing me?
i also fed some ducklings.
whatever. but i think you look great already.
hospital, eh? wow, everyone's goin' there tonight.
why don't you admit i know it's around here somewhere?
yeah, yeah, yeah. i need some dinner, stat! and the kids need some cpr lessons.
marge! we're out of bath towels. ooh, ice cream truck! here in my car / i am hosing off blood / some of it's mine / but most of it's not / here's marge...
ooh, typed!
no problem. two hundred and eighty-six pages!
woo hoo! i'm half-way through! all right, "chapter one." hm, that makes sense. "there once was a girl from nantucket..." good, good... "her name was temperance barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. she..." no! gotta read marge's book. can't get distracted. hm... "distracted," that's a funny word. does anyone ever get "tracted?" let me call the suicide hotline and ask them.
oh, yes.
i did.
no! they were all in their own way totally awesome.
as i've always said: "publish or perish"!
what are you talking about?
why do you keep talking that way?!
well, then maybe i will.
that one i got.
i didn't lie. i was writing fiction with my mouth. just tell me how much of this is true!
i knew it! and what about the romance between you and cyrus?
well, i'll make sure you never imagine anything again.
flanders, i'm gonna do something i shoulda done a long time ago. would you help me be a better husband?
uh-huh.
why would i rub her back unless i wanted to get some... oh, to make her feel good.
that's right. i love you marge, and i realize now i should show you more often. the end of your book was the wakeup call i needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book.
don't worry about those losers, marge. i think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own.
all i know is the guy who played mozart was also in "animal house." now there's a movie with good music. animal house house house... / nobody ever went to class... / then we saw donald sutherland's ass... / animal house house house... /
a lot of that went in my lungs.
that's great. i'm honored to drink to apu and, uh... apulina. you know, marge and i have an anniversary coming up.
these charity address labels that came in the mail.
five bucks? i don't need your sharity! i'll dance for my money!
i am so wasted. oh my god, oh my god, we're having a simultaneous pass out!
hm...
hey, i know you. we met in a police lineup.
coke and pepsi are the same thing! wake up, people!
marge, i'm not gonna lie to you...
all the answers you need are in here. happy anniversary!
nope.
nope.
close, but no cigar. just plain diamonds.
i heard if you age them for ten years, they turn to liquor.
yeah, you heard your mother.
but marge, it was all for you. to buy you all the nice things you deserve. the flowers, the earrings, the bob seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice...
i don't understand.
hoo boy, are you in trouble.
when a woman says nothing's wrong that means everything's wrong. and when a woman says everything's wrong, that means everything's wrong. and when a woman says something's not funny, you'd better not laugh your ass off.
butt on bowl, little man!
it doesn't matter! ee-yow!
it's old lady simpson! run!
uhh... i'll tell you what's goin' on... ...i'm taking you all out for pancakes!
either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks spanish. hey, apu, what's with the line?
pre-nursery school?!
are you saying my daughter can't cut it? just because i owe you fourteen thousand dollars? i'll show you! c'mon, maggie. you're getting into that school!
which one? tri-city? omni-pay? insta-threat? i've beaten 'em all!
oh, maggie will do just fine. she'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer...
...who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? geez.
i'm taking you all out for tacos!
woo-hoo! i got that one right too!
so our kids keep getting smarter! if we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids.
if you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. i'm slappin' this sucker right over "support our troops."
your mother's right, honey. katie couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!
that still sounds like the smart kid.
i'll be right back.
why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? why, santa, why?
oh, i knew it!
hit the red button!
oh good, she's here in time to see us die!
well, marge, you can't say i never take you anywhere.
well, i think we all learned a lesson today: don't try to be something you're not. namely, food.
how'd you get in here?
that's my baby, jerk.
i am so there!
how 'bout "diet coke -- the movie?"... "president air bud: tail to the chief?"... "my big fat greek salad?"
ooh, well, i am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. and the wager only sweetens the deal.
the re-deadening? is that any good?
hey lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?
don't ruin it for me! one adult and four children for "the re-deadening."
relax, stupid. everything you see is make believe. although it is based on a true story. some of which happened in this very theater.
but scaring kids is good for them. it hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.
who loves ya, baby?
okay. you have the right to remain sexy. anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. if you cannot afford a sex-torney--
i thought we killed him!
oh yeah. that monkey got america through some tough times.
no way! he's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
c'mon, little fella. you're hangin' with me tonight.
i'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.
all of them.
four jacks. check it out! i own a multi-national corporation. i always knew some day i'd be a c.o.d.
investor confidence? perhaps this affects me -- i own two hundred and thirty million shares of ziffcorp stock.
i sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.
plead the fifth amend-what? refuse to answer on the grounds that i what? inseminate myself? dudes, i think this guy's comin' on to me.
your majesty, can i go home now?
aw, it's no use, son. by the time i get out of here you'll be grown. turn around / turn around / turn around and you're a young man / and you're too big to choke.
can i apply my time toward a future crime?
oh bart, what a man you've become.
i don't think we've seen the last of artie ziff.
oh, i'm so bored! maybe i'll clean out my wallet. hey, my car insurance expired. quite a while ago.
that was you!?
and i know just where to find him. 742 evergreen terrace.
he's in the house?
and it's a perfect time... i just got fired again.
marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? i mean, who am i gonna complain about while i'm drinking?
hm, all right, we'll go on the winery tour. but you'll have to catch me first! ow, my ankles snapped.
ahh, summer in tuscany.
pleasant aroma, rich full body, well-aged... and the wine's not bad either.
i drank this much!
oh honey, i love to hear you laugh.
yes you do.
hey, you do a great me, marge. you gotta show the guys at moe's.
come on, we'll have a blast. kids, while we're out, the tv's in charge. go to bed when it says.
sorry, marge -- i gotta break in my ski boots some time.
no problem. we can still have fun without you drinking.
you got it. and when i feel weak, i will draw strength from the bible. uh-oh. here comes the gospel according to puke.
don't worry, honey. i don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing.
you can just nurse it. nurse it! nurse it!
yes, and you've said that several times now.
in a minute, honey. oh my god! if i get one more d.u.i., they'll take away my license. and what will i leave when i rent rollerblades?
but you do believe it, right?
she's not coming anymore.
listen, moe. i did something really terrible to someone i love.
well, what i did was...
can i have some peanuts?
feed my pets and tape my shows!
dammit!
marge! i have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. i put you behind the wheel and i'm so, so, so sorry.
marge, i did it out of love. love of not being arrested. but i realize now that nothing is more important than you.
no wonder they call it "the good book."
aw, shut up, captain bringdown.
okay, marge. for you i'll give up rum-based cocktails. except mojitos and rum and coke.
all right. for you, i will give up all clear liquors.
hey, anything's possible. with a little help from my bible. oh no! it's a real one! noooooo! why god, why?
woo hoo!
so many shoppers. ow! damn this... ow! resilient economy.
dressing room? uh oh.
it's not all your fault. all these years, i watched you turn our son into a time bomb, and yet i did nothing. so in a way, i too am a victim... of you.
oh, i get it. blame the strangler.
my poor boy is miserable in here. there has to be something i can do to help him. interesting. marge, what does that sign say?
i believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
put that sissy down! if you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?
that's right. i got a job here so i can watch over you like a mother hen.
i sure am. here you go, son. i brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge.
well, that's the end of my shift. see you monday. oh wait, monday's martin luther king day. i'll see ya when i see ya. love you.
relax, what's the worst that could happen?
no son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun. let's go.
son, i want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive.
gina, thanks for showing us the meaning of christmas.
she sure loves that couch.
come on, it's your last night of freedom. you gotta have some fun.
hey, take it easy on skinner. he's just down 'cause after tomorrow, everything he does is wrong.
what are you trying to tell me, skinner?
oh man, is this awkward. i'm outta here.
yeah marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. oh uh, by the way... can i borrow your car tomorrow? mine's acting up.
hey, you're the one always bugging me to screw up our marriage.
whatever. the important thing is to get skinner to that altar. because once a union has been sanctified by god, it takes at least six months to tear it apart. right, naked duffman?
this is fat load. i'd like to request a new codename.
okay, fat load here.
hey champ. ready to take the plunge?
yeah, he's crazy all right.
wait a minute. i thought you didn't wanna get married.
don't worry, principal skinner.
hey, if we get your girlfriend back i won't have to.
marge? are you helping her?
shut up! i didn't tell you to say that!
because i'm successfully married.
uh-oh. why did i take it off? oh, right. to see if i could skip it across lake michigan.
and the castrati?
give her back to skinner! a fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!
okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my lois lane comics, buy some jimmy olsens, and stop edna from making a terrible mistake!
don't worry, marge. we'll get something to eat.
that room has a dry erase board. they could be doing anything in there! anything.
and now, padre, if you would do the honors.
marge, you just agreed to raise the kids klingon!
okay, don't go. just stay here and rot with grampa.
i'll right-side you!
exactly.
the simple something that dum deedle dum dee dee... / now let's push plaaay!
yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the hell up!
eh, well, i wouldn't be happy.
we're alone now.
why you little...
here's your future!
remember our honeymoon?
we get one weekend to ourselves and we've gotta spend it watching some old geezer's odometer turn over? as the bible says: screw that! we don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane.
there's a first class?
and look at me, i'm reading "the economist." did you know indonesia is at a crossroads?
it is.
you keep thinking that!
marge, i won't let that happen. we have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. not 'til lisa's in college and we've lost contact with bart.
i've got a card that can take us anywhere in the world!
oh yeah, like people in new jersey have never seen a fat man makin' out. it's on the freakin' state flag.
and now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. but before the intercourse, the dinner course.
all i wanted was a second honeymoon, and now the floor is made of lava.
never!
because i was saving that for my birthday. now, c'mon!
quiet, the commercial's on! if we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing tv.
do i ever!
would i!
i'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! the only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
huh?
judge a pig competition?... but i'm no super-genius! or are i?
hey, i know that country!
usa! usa!
but i've gotta do something! i'll need a disguise.
oh, i have a funny feeling we will. wherever people are mistreated, the pie man will strike!
that's really sweet, honey. aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down.
what's wrong, son?
maybe you're right, lisa. maybe you're pie. pie-be you're pie.
comic book guy! don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
oh, i think you'd find his filling extremely hot.
flanders!? he's not man enough to trim my crust. i mean pie man's crust. i'm not pie man.
no trap can hold homer simpson! but i'm not homer simpson. i'm the pie man. homer simpson away! i mean, the pie man!
dammit!
pie man is not your father, little girl. i... murdered your father.
we shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
honorable men can differ. now what brings you down here?
all right, i'll stop. but what'll i do with these pies?
i was in so deep, i forgot pies were food.
i'll show him. no, i shouldn't. or should i? i'll keep my promise, honey.
you're all so wise... i wish i could eat each and every one of you.
i've run out of pie-related puns!
it's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!
i already work for you.
nooo! not community service -- i can't stand helping others! i just can't!
no, not him! anyone but him! i've had my problems with him. everyone has. but like every monster, he just wants to be loved.
what if he started pieing good people? not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?
no, i'm not. and here's a picture that proves it. see...
oh come on, she's a little girl.
sorry.
the dalai lama!
i can't do this in front of lisa. why does she have to believe in things?
i'm telling you, i'm the pie man!
yeah. let's go home, honey.
was it the kiss?
eww! i kissed that sad, weird kid! my beer! you never had a chance to become my urine! why you little...
permission to treat this witness as hostile.
actually, marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you.
oh, this is so confusing. i'd like a brief recess.
whee! recess!
i'm so lame!
well, that stinks. but i still get to kiss you, right?
think, homer, think.
i'm elvis. elvis jagger. elvis jagger abdul-jabbar.
it was pretty delicious.
whuh-oh.
she sure did. now if lisa is finished with her shenanigans, i'll tell you why i didn't show up...
hey, have you two longshoremen seen a pretty girl?
no. i just blew my first chance at true love.
what about now?
what about now?
what about now?
that's not true! i thought about that girl every day of my life... until i met you.
all right. this is my memory box. i haven't opened it in thirty years. ooh, a letter from my old pen pal. someday i'll write you back, osama. ah, here's what i'm lookin' for.
i sure did. i kept it right next to my ibm stock... king.
oh, anonymous girl who turned out to be marge.
don't forget maggie!
doctor! perform a diagnosis!
cool!
oh, sorry, right. bart, pass the corn. bart, pass the corn!
to date!
even my best friends have left me! i'm all alone!
y'ello. appear on your tv show?! tell our side of the story?! you'll see us there?! goodbye?! dial tone?!
no, no, no, let her finish.
talk about boats! then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't.
there there, save your lies for the american public.
what'd you say?
buy me some peanuts and crackerjack... / i don't care if... ow!
bill clinton? what are you doin' here?
yeah, yeah. next commercial.
who are you?
i don't want to be in any stupid talent show. not without my tennessee walking horses.
fifty stars and thirteen stripes...
to love our country is no chore...
we mean it, don't move.
because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. and this time i want it tight!
great, dive in.
i'm not made of money! we'll swim to oakland.
oh, what's the use? even if they pick us up, we'll go back to jail 'cause they think we hate america. i don't want to end up like elmo, hanging himself in prison.
and here no one calls me a fat jerk... i'm a gourmand!
simpson.
ooh, that'll save some time. now, kids, it'll take us a while to assimilate. i'll start out as a cop, and then, with time, become a dirty cop.
if that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. we'll lose tourists! and then who will buy my roadside corn?
there's a lot you don't know about me, marge. a lot that would shock you.
bart, you're grounded for a year.
okay, three bucks.
or that lady who wheels larry flynt around!
i'm always happy to help you, sweetie. he tosses a paper and yells out the window. extree! extree! man driving erratically throws papers out window!
oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind.
wait a minute. are you trying to get dirt on lisa?
well, if that's your custom.
okay. well, she's into buddhism, whistle-blowing, totally against pollution no matter what i say...
i'm so sorry, honey. i said good things about you too. check out the lifestyle section: "plastic pearls make the girl."
oh, i can't stand seeing one of my children like this.
marge, i'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers.
"all my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. i may be her father, but when i grow up, i wanna be just like her. except still a dude."
you're the only one who won't shut up about it.
trying to get a frisbee off the roof.
and while you're there, can you get my frisbee off the ledge?
hey flanders, have you seen my frisbee?
what kind of bread?
woo hoo!
flanders? kill me? you never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
hey chief, throw me your piece.
never!
fine, i'll never go back. starting tomorrow. today is lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake.
but ice cream cake...
it sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
hmmm, i wonder if i could blow up heaven?
cool. you guys got a good buffet up here?
you're not the boss of me.
shrink ray? oh, there's always something else to buy.
screw you, doc! i fly from the gut.
bah! has science ever kissed a woman, or won the super bowl, or put a man on the moon? this is what i think of your precious science.
marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage.
there's a whole rack of 'em over there. i only ate two.
we'll have to lighten the ship, which means one of us has to stay behind. bart?... lisa?... fine, me.
i'm saying goodbye to everything i ever loved. ooh, a marshmallow! boy, when god closes a door, he opens a window.
i say when we're full. you don't wanna piss off a man who can kick you in the crotch from the inside. i need a mouth hole. and some other holes too.
i've got you deep in the heart of me...
a slightly colder fridge? in my lifetime? amazing.
and check this out. a walk-in microwave! hey marge, can you press stop when my popcorn's done? uh-oh.
and i kept that vow.
i'll build you a new kitchen, sweetie.
all right.
fine. easy... easy...
trying to.
but i need them for the articles!
steady, steady...
thanks, marge. i can't wait to read about "sport fishing with sonny jurgensen." what man would want you now?
oh, now you tell me.
so that's what that white noise was.
why don't you just kiss her?
how 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars. i was thinking of chicken wings. those are good too.
your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
marge, i don't want to freak you out, but i think i love you.
adult themes? what are you talking about?
stupid bart. bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
hey sweetie, is mom winning?
but she'll still win the contest?
woo-hoo! if marge becomes auntie ovenfresh, we'll meet all the food personalities... look! it's mister cashew... the koobler dwarfs... snip, crinkle and poof... twinkle the kidd, i love you!
uh-oh.
blood for creme! blood for creme!
would you excuse us, milton?
uh-um... what do you think "some" is?
i thought i'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life. do you know what a boob is?
good. that'll save us some time. okay... why do you think your mother and i sleep in the same bed?
exactly. and we're poor because we have kids. and the biological method by which children are created by a man and a woman is...
and marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house.
hey, it keeps the kids quiet.
that's ridiculous, honey. you're the cutest little girl i know. you just have what is known as the simpson butt. permit me to elaborate. every simpson starts with a circle. daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. hm, i'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an "m" and a "g."
nice try, loser. i bet you made up a fake test.
really? frankfurter... is that anything?
all right, boy, which con did you work here? copy off another kid? pay attention and take notes? well, take note of this!
i thought you two broke up.
oh, what's the big deal? bart didn't like his presents. so what? it's not like he gives us such great gifts. remember that maple leaf ironed between the sheets of wax paper? what was that? that was crap.
open.
well, that explains a lot. who's hungry?
they're a family again. and so are we. what happened?
and lisa, what have you learned?
c'mon, say something conclusive.
open-ended! c'mon, lisa. say everything's fine. everything's fine.
prove it.
woo hoo! free cheese!
woo hoo! the circus!
woo hoo! i don't know the difference!
what about that two-headed goat?
yes, but he came here to die. one of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. how you solved crimes i'll never know.
huh? huh?
i sawed you on the television.
i believe it was the school's tuba.
oh marge, i'm just being polite.
oh come on, marge. the only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet. i'm here! i'm here! quit buggin' me!
it's a conversation starter!
i swallowed a chicken bone.
same one.
oh honey, her life can't compare to yours. you've got three kids, a tv tray from expo sixty-seven, and you're married to king stink!
marge, listen to me. chloe may have a flashy job, but you're the backbone of this family. you're like the electrical tape that holds the two halves of my car together.
i just hate to see you upset, honey. you know what would be a good name for maggie? chloe.
oh. well then, carry on.
you uh... why you little... need a reason for strangling, do ya... i'll fix your wagon!
and i'm growing ashamed of my penis.
marge, that's crazy talk. now look, i'll save lisa. your place is here with the women.
okay, you go save lisa. i'll stay here with the women.
okay. i'll run as fast as i can, but i'm full of potato salad.
chief, my daughter's up there. you're a father too.
pretend to care!
whew!
oh yes you are. why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle.
yeah, that's how it starts.
bart's shirt is a classic, marge. just like "keep on truckin'". as if i would ever want to stop truckin'.
you broke in!
you know what, mr. burns? i'm never comin' back. my son's making so much cash in the t-shirt game, that i don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as i age.
bart, can i ask you an important question?
twenty-nine ninety-nine.
woo hoo!
hey, just 'cause i'm not working doesn't mean i can't gripe like you guys. don't you hate it when people steal your lunch out of the break-room fridge?
oh, i see what's goin' on. you can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence.
no problem. bart, i need two hundred dollars.
i broke some bathroom fixtures.
i don't have an inside voice!
lisa, basic cable said i should nurture you.
okay! you be the girl, and i'll be the car.
screw the market, we're going to mexico!
hey, what's that dealy?
oh, you'll win for sure. you and science go together like lenny and carl. the science is carl.
honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. remember, i did used to work at a science factory.
sweetie, that's orphan talk.
up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!
sweetie, your daddy's gonna show you just how much he loves you. you know that non-functioning nuclear reactor you built?
i juiced it up a little.
oh, that's madiculous.
son, when you grew up, i grew down. but now i can see you need your dad more than ever.
get back in the garage, old man.
stay out of my boxes!
sir, this is a class two plutonium fission reactor. if i turn this dial... the resulting blast would destroy the entire tri-city area, including that guy who sells those blu-blocker sunglasses people sometimes wear. damn him to hell.
not so fast. i also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of bart's t-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat. yo, yo, yo! keep it on the low flow! i'm hangin' this over the mantel.
well, i'm just glad we're back to me being the father and you being the son.
oh, i doubt it. but we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out.
par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
really? how'm i doin'?
hey, it's a guy in a goofy burns head! act like burns! that's him to a t!
wow, a wooden plane. it's about time trees were good for something, instead of just standing there like jerks.
what a magical party this has been. mr. burns is a great man.
spill it, super-boss!
i'll get a second job. one that pays well. you think those guys on "friends" need another friend?
dammit! i would've been perfect as rachel's irish cousin. so you're all doing each other, are ya? well, who's going to put out for old seamus?
-- as long as i only work five hours a day, no heavy lifting, no light clerical, none of that secret santa crap, tasteful nudity...
dad?
the border, eh? then i'd better sand off my fingerprints.
wow, this is just like hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. what gives?
oh man, i need something to settle my stomach. oh wait. i was supposed to take these with food.
flanders? i don't know... i mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday.
no cameras?
listen you two, i'll tell you who the true god is if you're both quiet the rest of the trip!
all right, i'm comin' back there.
dad, you tried your best. for the first time in my life i can say, without being drunk, that i truly admire you.
there are other ways to get into canada... that's it, a plane!
sure it will. all we need is a pilot!
katharine hepburn?!
really? in america we do it four times a week. you come on down and i'll get us front row seats.
don't dump me out! i can lose weight! just give me a chance. one... two... eh, i'd rather die.
well, at least we're all in this together.
see you in hell, document!
screw you.
smoked salmon... shrimp... crab legs! i win...
i've never been so embarrassed. and the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! i'll see you all at lupper!
oh, who are you, the health inspector?
i can't go to a gay bar, i'm too fat! moe, i'm gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes.
okay honey, i'll do it.
that was me.
marge! how dare you open a letter addressed to both of us?
look, look. i can see you're upset. if you need me, i'll be at moe's.
marge, you can't go with me to moe's. i mean, how would you like it if i came with you to your mother's?
that's because i hate her.
but i don't wanna take care of the kids... um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? bart sleeps in the microwave, right?
just what are you inferring?
whew, that's a relief!
ah yes, detroit-style. very nice. so, you've been at moe's every night this week.
bonded?! how many times?
well, i might as well use this pucker for something.
hey moe... haven't seen you in a while.
how do you know about that?
you do?
can i learn it at a happy place?
what do i do?
you're absolutely right! stop this ride!
well, i can go all night, baby. i could listen to you two, maybe three, times.
what's a cuckold?
he's only your emotional uncle! i'm your real uncle!
i'm off!
but i have to get to the airport to save my marriage!
toilet hole. you leave my wife alone!
uh... ice?
oh, it's true. i don't know marge at all. i'll just go home now.
moe, you've won. i'll see you at baggage claim.
and you're my margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.
think of me babe whenever / some sweet talking guy in a thong / hands you a bong / don't take... you better be strong
'cause i want a sandwich
or maybe a manwich...
oh, i've only got a hundred dollars. i'd better bid shrewdly.
one hundred dollars!
dammit! i never win anything! ooh, here's something i'm good at.
easy... gentle...
i know why you're here. you wanna see me humiliate myself with my stupid dance. well fine.
woo hoo! but why?
you wanna do my dance after you score?
woo-hoo!
honey, i bet you're wondering why daddy's not at work again. the answer may surprise you. i have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player.
don't forget showboating. that's the cornerstone of my "pyramid of success." ooh, i forgot crotch grabbing. that'll be the sun.
i think i can fit you in. let's see... lenny, can i move you from wednesday at noon to sunday at six?
all right, all right, i'll work it out.
i wanna see him too. maybe he can tell me how to get this off. it soaked through to the other side!
wow. at last, my pathetic little life has a meaning. you suckers, i would have done it for free!
dammit! well, i'll still do it. you suckers, i would have paid you.
dammit! will you take a check?
every single super bowl halftime show has been great.
i don't know. it's a lot of pressure. do many people watch the super bowl?
uh... uh... oh man, i have no idea what i'm going.
have you tried checking the oil filter?
yeah... you help me, and i, in turn, am helped by you.
we now take you back through the ages, to a time before tv, before cowboys, before dinosaurs. the time of the bible! the children of god once lived according to their father's laws. but then a shadow of wickedness fell across the land, as represented by this cloud of white pesticide! but there was one righteous man: noah! oh mighty god, send a flood to destroy this wickedness.
after forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and noah sent forth a single dove...
i thought america was hungry for meaning. i should have just sent a crocodile into space like i originally planned.
quiet, you!
go seminoles! cover-the-point-spread! cover-the-point-spread!
where's the remote! this is not a drill, people!
barf for your master! lousy american-made dog! why must i be so voluptuous?
go to hell.
fine, go nuts.
i love you too, jerry.
son, your mother makes a very loud point...
baby boy, baby boy, ba-ba-ba-baby boy
bart's gone! i checked everywhere!
if that's true, he's gonna be like nwa -- not without ass-welts.
a flying rock! call a geologist!
the bad news keeps on coming.
oh yeah? send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.
i know what i'm doing. you can use any section of the paper. except metro. it's a big snooze.
oh son!... taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing i've ever done.
hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which i've already lost, for the rights to bart's story. so i have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true.
what shirt? i don't see any shirt. burn the truth. burn the truth.
you leave maggie to me.
not her! she'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!
the lie is love.
love the lie!
yeah, be cool. like us. coolee, coolee cool! c'mon, fool! be coolee, coolee cool!
lisa, the world is a very complicated place. and when you get right down to it... cannonball!
two hundred bucks a couple, eh? hey, i gotta get in on this! these people have rights! the right to buy me a sixty-two inch tv!
now to answer all the pop-ups. ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. that's only fair.
it brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. photo mouse pads for sale out back.
hey, what can i say? i love love.
but i'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars.
opposite? yuck!!
hm. well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. what's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?
ooh, look at me. i'm straight as a one dollar bill. la de da. ooh.
oh kent, not anything. it has to exist. or does it?
if you love the bible so much, why don't you marry it? in fact, i now pronounce you and the bible man and wife. and you're the wife. you owe me two hundred bucks.
which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. which will put more green in the blue. the blue being my pants.
lemme get my belt sander. maybe i can grind the ugly off your face.
yeah, big surprise. hey marge, here's another bomb: i like beer.
now patty, here's a veil i picked out just for you.
give it back!
son, that's the stupidest idea i ever heard. and i know exactly who would pay top dollar for it.
why you little... save my place.
yeah, "bride of the monster."
got him! uh-oh.
oh lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as i consecrate another gay union that angers you so. and please let thy holy spirit open the heart of my wife. amen.
next!
if anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace.
people please, can we wrap this up? it's gonna rain and i've gotta get the bikes in here.
patty, i admire your decision. it takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. so i'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge.
dad, where's your base?!
eh, they'll be fine.
that coot happens to be my father. please continue.
is there a chance for advancement?
aw, dammit! chief, how are we supposed to live with our kids constantly separated?
don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. i have a more humane solution. this twenty-foot pole will make bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. and i used my sprawl*mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. it'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!
show you what it's like in the real world!
yeah, he's all "cowabunga, dude!" what's that mean? nothing, i bet.
i won't do it.
but i'm a u.s. citizen.
dios mio!
i've never worked all night, never! and i worked at an all-night diner for three years! i slept on the grill.
that's it, mister. i am disgruntled. and up until now, i was relatively gruntled! i did it! i pulled it out! and with no brain damage-amage-amage-amage-amage-amage. now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!
really? then why do you still work here?!
i'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
mmm, hot dog.
and it's something to be feared -- right, doctor?
come on kids, we should go. goodbye, selma.
i know. that was for the other patients. my thingies!
great, another job lost to a foreigner.
i'll give you one.
hey dragon! you fly like a girl!
you name it, oh wise mountain ape.
but marge, i don't want her to be happy.
okay, i'll do it. because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. ha-ha, now we're even!
and this is marge, our surprisingly hot nanny.
don't mention it, miss october. but don't look at her passport, it's different.
i've heard of these guys. you can wave your arms at 'em and make funny faces, and they just have to stand there and take it.
i finally get this play!
i'm a nuclear-- i'm a chinese acrobat!
you guys are commies? then why am i seeing rudimentary free markets?
awww. she likes my eyes.
it wasn't easy, marge -- i've missed you so much.
is there any other kind?
wow, the fortune cookies here really are more accurate.
i was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. but i don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours.
wait, you're not bart! eh, close enough.
don't worry. if i croak, you'll marry lenny. or moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game i invented. i got all the rules written down... up here.
sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. but i'm not gonna die for many, many years.
haven't we all?
yes i am.
sssh! i want her to think i'm cool! if i sign it, it still counts! my hemophilia! uninsurable?!
huh?
way ahead of you, marge -- i just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. they should get here soon. i paid a bundle for over-night delivery.
well, i'll get a lawyer on that. no, a whole team of lawyers. who will dine on mustard flown in from the orient.
i'm sorry, moe. marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!
marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far.
you can't enjoy money when you're dead, so why not have fun now?
yes, president franklin.
well, i invented a popsicle made of mountain dew.
you banged?
no, i spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. i need a castle where i can be king!
hey, i couldn't leave you kids. you're like my own family. now check this place out!
i'll let you punch me!
we'll have christmas tomorrow!
boy, i wouldn't mind driving that to the holland, michigan tulip festival.
are you crazy? let twelve complete strangers live on my lawn?
it's a deal! woo hoo!
these are my new friends. they like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.
sorry, marge. we've got the power now. and you can't turn us off!
name one way i'm not!
i seem to recall you asked me to get this fat!
i'm marge simpson. don't eat off the floor.
that was my woodstock!
oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! they've stolen a car and they're home alone.
don't worry about the suvs. there's a gentle curve up ahead.
i'm not a machine -- i can't just turn it on!
why you little...!
bring back our children, you cyprus-splitting jerks!
will you raise them christian?
noooo!
marge, you're taking this pretty well.
look, we'll compromise. we'll go see a play...that lisa doesn't want to see.
hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot!
make it seven!
there must have been a mistake. my body is a temple.
i'm not supposed to be new meat. i'm supposed to have your job.
oh my god! that man might be hurt! guards, there's a prisoner in there!
squealin'? no, i just wanted to help him.
really? you mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?
well... i don't know.
well, i would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. i've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. okay, you've found your snitch.
homer simpson has become a snitch.
who? oh, that "my mother." tell him thanks.
sure, they're on top of the world. then there's a big riot scene. then i don't know, i usually doze off.
what are you dopes lookin' at? you've never seen bling-bling before?
how come nobody told me before?
there's gonna be a breakout tonight.
marge! how did you get in here?
marge, c'mon! we'll be safe in the gas chamber.
marge, i'm sorry i got you into this mess. can i snitch on my heart and say... "i love you"?
hold on a minute. governor, i've been using my powers of snitching for evil. but now i want to tattle for good. this prison is a hellhole. they feed us horse meat -- with traces of jockey meat!
how do you know the title of my prophetic vision?
what'd i miss? what'd i miss?
well, maybe i was partying so hard with my single friends last night, i forgot the rules. why? is it messing you up?
stupid wildlife, serves 'em right.
you wish, loser!
boy, i think i see my two favorite letters of the alphabet. e-z.
son, say hello to edna. oopsie.
hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. we split up, it's all cool, i... i'll kill you!
you don't know the half of it.
don't worry, marge -- hot wheels to the rescue! the water flows down here, through the straightaway, a couple of wicked s-turns... around the loop of death...and out the mail slot! then it's the yard's problem.
aw, that's it. i'm going to moe's! it's raining outside.
aw, guys. this is just what i needed.
so why didn't you invite me?
i wouldn't ruin a surprise for lenny.
i'm sorry. i'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
well, i can see i'm not wanted here.
how did it ever come to this? i'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. i don't have a friend in the world.
the sun.
wow, it's been so long since i've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig i am. mine. oh, move your hand. i get this!
ray, you know me better than anyone. how can i get my wife to love me again?
wait, did i add that right?
to my new buddy. now all we need is an awesome theme song. whatever plays next on the jukebox.
next song. / that's what i meant. / absolutely.
i think that means six more weeks of autumn.
how did you know?
you're right, marge -- i guess i should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats. high-five!
ray would high-five me.
oh ray! you came at the agreed-upon time.
i didn't really check. i mainly bought this house for the view. some day that bowl will overflow, and i'll be there.
one, two, three, four -- i declare a nail war!
ned, are you okay?
goodbye, ray! bye! oh, he turned the corner. ooh! now i see him again!
my new best friend. we think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches...
ray's not gonna like that.
well if i was, we'd have taller kids!
what's in the box?
i don't have to -- ray's gonna be here any minute.
all right, then you can just look at the portrait i painted of him.
something like that.
did you make enough for ray?
oh thank god. where is he? tell me!
ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.
yes he does. he's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! you'll see! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, how we'll laugh!
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
fine, i admit it. help me, ray! appear and strike them down!
but that's not true, bart saw him at the builder's barn.
flanders, you saw ray on the roof with me!
ned, are you okay? there has to be someone who saw him -- someone who doesn't hate me like flanders and bart... wait! the bartender at knockers.
well, that's a world of difference. light me up, doc!
aw, what did he die of?
sorry. give me one that doesn't taste so good.
marge, write that down so we can have it at home.
fascinating!
oh kids, i heart you, too! man, i'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. although to be honest, i did enjoy lying down.
it's ray! i see him again! monster! you don't exist.
the awesome power of the human mind.
wait a minute. i went through a lot of pain and suffering because of this little misunderstanding. somebody owes me big!
that's a given! there's something else. something much more else.
not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't.
what are you talking about?
and what's the network?
at what time?
and if i wanna watch it, what day?
and this is on the radio?
on what channel?
what day?
on the radio?
turn the television to what channel?
now if i wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it?
and what time? would be a good time to see it?
so if i turn my radio on at nine o'clock...
so it's mondays at nine, on nbc.
on the radio.
television at three o'clock.
marge, no machine could ever replace you. why you-- or could it? marge-bot! i'm ready for some lovin'! why did i give her a gun? but i repeat: no one is being replaced by a machine. until all the kinks are worked out.
aw, my little boy's in love.
you get better, son. meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the "library."
milkshake festival. look, you can see the booths from your window.
lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. c'mon, everybody get in here. hurry.
overeating. and if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. but there won't be time.
son, i just wanna leave you with a piece of advice -- become emotionally dead. leave your body. make lots of friends!
so that's where my soot went!
even better, i'll ask him for my job back.
youth? i hate them. secondly...
fifty dollars? what about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
neunundneunzig luftballons / auf ihrem weg zum horizont / hielt man fuer ufos aus dem all / darum schickte ein general /
eine fliegerstaffel hinterher / alarm zu geben, wenn es so war / dabei war da am horizont / nur neunundneunzig luftballons
did you hear that foxy, the fox network fox?
time to take out the euro-trash.
now, everything's perfect again.
but who else needs to lose weight? maggie? grampa? my seldom-seen half brother herb? why is everyone looking at me?
oh, that's terrible.
cheeseburger.
i don't wanna.
here's a corner.
you're a selfish jerk.
fine. i'd rather die.
i need change for a dollar.
what's the cheapest thing you've got?
five ninety-nine?! what a rip-off! someone should shoot you!
i think it's staying down. it's staying down! it's not staying down. wait. yes, it's staying down. oh no, it's not! yes it is. no it's not! yep. no. yep. no! yep. no! yep. no. yep. no. yep. no.
where's my bucket?!
lisa sings so sweetly and bart is my pillow... everyone's good for something.
and she's giving us the emotional experience of a lifetime. oh, thank you for this angel, lord!
here you go, honey. sing this.
much of the tune is plagiarized. now go, go, go!
you did it, sweetie!
of course, sweetie. you and i are gonna write and sing our way out of this godforsaken hellhole.
good job, sweetie. every time you hit that note, i'll shoot a glass with my bb gun.
honey, our time together is precious to me. i didn't want to say anything, but i don't think i'm gonna be around much longer.
well, moe's getting a big screen tv in february. just in time for the pro bowl. maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win.
let daddy go talk to the man. may i have a word with you? is that green enough for you, sweetie? 'cause i can make it greener...
marge, lisa and i were just discussing how to improve tonight's performance. now you're confusing her by telling her she was perfect.
my little girl likes red vines! you little...
hey, these are red vines. here you go, sweetie. daddy got you your candy.
hey, gimme a break. living through lisa is the healthiest thing that ever happened to me.
then would you like to see it getting made?
fired... me? everything i did, i did for you.
do you know the hours i worked? the people i had to yell at? the tires i had to slash?
it's called smoozing!
his name isn't cameron anymore. he's now "johnny rainbow."
i'm not mr. simpson. that ship has sailed. i'm colonel cool! and i'm the captain on this rocket to the stars.
neither. i'm both. all right, i wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands. don't stop till it's as natural as breathing.
marge. bart. maggie. santa's little helper. lisa!
we are!
lisa. um, at the end of your song, remember to look into the spotlight. it makes your eyes twinkle.
you're welcome.
i always was, honey. look. cameron's about to sing the song i wrote for him. he's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business.
i'll always be there. not even death will stop me.
how 'bout "i love you, honey?"
kids, wanna go to the mall?! they're baking fresh cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!
oh, big surprise. the fat guy's eating garbage.
finally, a character i can relate to. i bet good things happen to him.
left below?! where have i heard that before?
it's everywhere!
this movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like cannonball run two.
okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship.
blood is raining from the sky!
begat. uh, do you have any books on the rapture?
i'll take everything you've got!
marge, the rapture is nigh. these books will help me figure out how nigh. this whole deal is scientifically proven. the book of revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at the last supper... ...minus the number of filipinos in the bible...and you get... he writes "3150518" on the board.
up bup bup! three fifteen p.m., may 18th! that's when the rapture will be!
a week? that's...seven days from now!
funny story, kent. it's the end of the world! god loves you! he's gonna kill you!
marge, in a world gone mad, only a lunatic is truly insane.
well... i guess this thing does look pretty silly. let's all take off our sandwich boards and watch tv.
when the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here.
exactly. it came to me in a vision. or maybe it was a drunken haze. or, possibly, an ice cream headache.
but sweetheart, i have something they didn't have -- a good feeling about this.
c'mon, lisa. no one in this family is being left below.
don't worry, dad! there's a bus coming for you! drive, drive!
goodbye, stupid earth!
lisa, you still believe in me, don't you?
aw, that's my girl.
ow. ow. ow. ow. let's go to moe's. we'll walk and punch. ow. ow. ow. ow. huh?
forget school! we have to get to the mesa!
i'm comfortable like this.
how come it's not open yet?
hm...
oh, sorry, uh -- i'd tip you, but i don't have any cash.
lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. really top notch. but i can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering.
oh, he'll be fine. and you could still spare my family by--
buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy.
screw you, dino! you squandered your gift! uh-oh.
just send me back to earth, and put off this whole rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so.
superman did it.
no, i'm in a good place with that.
yeah, i'll definitely read those later. now listen, if you could just see your way clear to...
prison overcrowding, i've got a solution for that. oh my god! u-s-a! u-s-a!
free movie tickets?! i feel like roger ebert, or his kiss-ass new partner!
how about this guy?
shut up, flanders, i need a favor. would you mind watching maggie for a while? it would only be until later.
thanks, ned. you wear a bathing suit in the bathtub?
makes sense.
this theater sucks. my seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!
yes.
wait'll i tell everyone about this! i'll feel important without drinking! that'll be weird.
yep, and nobody's tellin' him. not even his good buddy god.
sensual, isn't it? and the best part is stupid flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. hence my nickname, stupid flanders.
uh, we're watching the latest photos from mars. ho, great stuff. worth every billion.
uh, i'm thinking about getting a yogurt franchise. it's called "plops" and...
okay. flanders, you see...
ned, i had no choice. it was just so funny!
mmm... soggy br--
you're right. but you know who the real victim is here? ned.
oh yeah.
last-diddily-ast? he's gone! and it's all someone's fault!
don't worry, marge. i've taken every precaution.
don't worry, i'll straighten things out with coach clay. we're good buddies. we play this game called "who can punch the softest?" and he always lets me win! hey coach, do you mind turning down the music? my baby's trying to take a nap.
lookin' good... feel the burn...
you're a god!... i can't think of any more!
go! go! go!
when are you gonna stop poking me? will it be soon?
but i siphoned that gas from flanders! flanders...
like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.
oh, i was just driving around the mid-atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and i just... oh, who am i fooling with my awesome lies? i want you to come back to springfield.
i am a little pudgy. you got me. yeah.
i saw my advantage and i took it. that's what heroes do.
maybe. we don't know that for sure.
go nuts. flanders. okay, that's it. really irritating!
how can we afford any of these private schools? they're all so expensive. if we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get grampa that new pacemaker?
get 'em from the smoke detector.
the smoke will wake us up.
catholic school, eh...? that'll straighten you out, boy. there, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to hell!
no meat?! what do they eat, light bulbs?
bart! what the hell are you saying?
mickey mouse's dog?
you've transformed breakfast into dinner. it's a miracle! log cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. blessed art thou among syrups and...
bingo? that's my favorite game. i just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
that's my favorite game. i just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
bingo!
you have to cheat. uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know...
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. no matter what i did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?
okay, let's make some magic here. i wiped a booger on your shirt, i made a dog and a cat kiss, i swiped a bolted-down tv from a holiday inn...
right. and how do i join? do i whale on some unitarians?
woo hoo!
marge, no one is saying twelve. nine, ten, tops. see...
marge, relax. i've never heard of anyone getting so upset about religion.
wow! up here, that feels good!
transubstantiation!
face it, marge -- catholics rule. we've got boston, south america, the good part of ireland, and we're making serious inroads in mozambique, baby!
why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? shouldn't bart and i be able to choose our own religion if we want to?
bwa?
hop in, boy! we'll show your mother our god kicks her god's butt.
the broncos won?! why didn't i bet on them, like professor pigskin told me to?
he's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
because he's got something no gambler's ever had: a system. i've gotten the pamphlet four weeks in a row, and every time, the "pick of the week" has been right on the money.
i have money!
...expiration date oh-six oh-eight. professor pigskin told me to bet on the raiders but they look awful.
hey, i didn't bet any of our money. i just borrowed some from him.
but the pig!
marge would kill me! please, there's gotta be something else i can do. like mow your lawn every week for two weeks. i can't do it next week. all right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house.
it got your hopes up, didn't it?
i swear.
because you look even more beautiful now than the day i married you.
guys, get out of here!
um... you're in the wrong house, lady.
honey, please, just listen to what i have to say.
i owed the mafia money...
when will you be back?
me? but i'm the father.
honey, come back! you didn't say bye to the kids!
well, we'd better go eat that yogurt. kids, i'm sure your mother will be back soon.
look, we've been down this road before. i do something stupid, your mom leaves, we eat waffles.
where's your sense of magic and wonder? c'mon, marge. when are you gonna call? let it ring. play hard to get. that's hard enough! oh-my-darling-i-love-you-please- forgive-me.
moe! what are you calling me for?
well, what if marge tries to call while i'm talking to you?
of course i have call waiting, you idiot! i just never learned how to use it! uh-oh. that might have broken the phone. i'd better call moe.
hello? marge? where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?
rugged? is that the same as handsome?
okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. i have cousins near here. we'll stay with them.
oh, the rubiest. ooh look! a new restaurant chain!
don't laugh! they're doing the best they can.
oh, just great. things couldn't be better.
she, uh, was killed by a falling air conditioner.
it wasn't all bad. as part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned. now if you'll excuse me, i have to use the outhouse again.
these are for you.
listen, i thought about what i did. and it was really, really wrong. i'm sorry.
i love you, marge.
wha...?!
well, that's very reasonable. you stole my wife! i'll kill you!
wow. i can see why she loves you.
you know everything.
and what a man!
why don't you pick on someone your own size?
look, if it were up to me, i'd be harassing them with you. if anything, i'd be the guy who took it too far. but i love my wife and i want to win her back!
rubes.
catch me if you can! manatees -- defend!
rubes... so many rubes... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes! please, no rubes...
marge, i'm always amazed you chose me.
woo hoo!
hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed r and r?
flanders, i can't listen to your crap before my coffee.
stupid best friend flanders.
stamps? those are for snail mail! stamps rule! i mean suck!
i think they killed each other. you know, one of those murder-suicide deals.
look at the bright side, marge. when i die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. that's multi-tasking.
okay, just let me clear some space.
hey, i love waking up drunk in the morning.
i, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter.
lisa, honey, if you sleep in your own bed tomorrow, we'll do something special, just for you.
lisa, when you've sustained as many blows to the head as i have, consistency is something, something that, something i love you, bart.
i thought it was twenty.
i can't believe you're making money off this!
butter face.
that's bull man.
oh, and that dr. hibbert was so boring... "homer, we've got to get that lump checked out... homer, we must discuss your test results... homer, we've got to find you a donor..." blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
oh, and i spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run.
tragically, yes.
okay, marge. but don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up.
don't worry, he's not showin' up.
finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house.
the brakes are shot.
learn to drive, boy!
uh... this is all i could find. why you very little...!
stationary camera.
and you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
marge, we owe her the truth!
uh... this is still part of your dream. dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
i forgot to floss this morning!
aw, poor maggie.
i know, and you did, and you're great.
oh. you always gotta work blue, don't ya marge? you're better than that. can't even go in my own kitchen... bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
noooo! bart, that's a really bad storage area!
why would you do that? are you a bad parent?
so you want maggie to infect your kids?
and would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
...fifteen dollars to infect your kids! now featuring the pox box! pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. like any disease box, results may vary. pox box!
now kids, in lieu of one of those inflatable jumping things, please welcome mr. krusty the clown!
goodbye, thanks for coming. if my party made you sick, tell your friends!
marge, what's happening to me?
i don't know. i kept away from maggie all day. i'm so itchy!
y'ello? no, i'm not coming into work. i have chicken pox. i know i said that last month, but i was lying. right... right... right... right... okay... right. i love you, bye! i just got fired. better check the "want ads." ooh! "truck drivers needed in iraq." trucks are like big cars.
okey-doke. and you are...
will she know what this is regarding?
that's ridiculous! no woman would want to have sex with that loser! and, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. good stuff.
well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but i have one more question: did you sleep with kirk van houten?
i repeat: did you sleep with kirk?
you're not saying no.
i'm still not hearing no.
gladly.
i came to get my mail. resident... occupant... i can't open these. ooh, a traffic ticket! i'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.
well, i'd better go.
you know the four seasons? well, i'm experiencing them first hand, because i'm living in the park.
where's my bucket?
why you little...
okay.
make it two kajillion.
of course i do. the only thing i can't believe is that a woman as great as you would be married to me.
i guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
wow. a robot kid would be a blast. we can confuse him and make his head explode. "this statement is a lie. but if it's a lie then it must be true. but if it's true, then it must be..." kaboom!
why you metal...!
nice and hot-o, mr. robot-o! david, you're by far the best son i've ever had. uh-oh.
replace is such an ugly word. we upgraded.
here, make me a kitty!
lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. in the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the american dream.
no toys!
you wanted to believe the lie!
those were my good pants.
this stinks! i've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
honey, animals don't feel death. that was proved by the scientists at black angus.
they look a little green.
yes i am! i mean... oh no! i've been killed! outfoxed 'im with the corpse of my best friend. hee-hee.
marge! you saved me. what was that for?
well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?
they'll bounce back, son. they're a strong people. ooh! ooh! i wanna ride the bumper cars!
i call the red one!
hmmm. i suppose i could use a little toning. i'll give you five dollars for it.
but i'm watching television. a lot of people worked hard on this show!
woo hoo! pizza for breakfast!
hello, domino's? what do you mean, you're not open? no, you call me back during business hours! i'll show you who's a recorded message!
hey, what's the big idea of getting trapped under that thing?
wha? hey, you...
excuse me, mr. bartender sir, may i have a sugar-free ginger ale? and uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds.
i'm joining the professional arm-wrestling circuit!
negatively, i assume.
okay.
did she say anything else?
oh marge, i love her so much.
he looks tough.
sorry, moe. the place for my arm is around my wife.
sweet home alabama... lord, i'm coming home to you / alabama! marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world.
i was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. now let's go to bed.
that song is a pop music footnote! i didn't say stop!
no father's day eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... daddy claus?
is there a super bowl bunny?
oh, can i come with you? i know i can't.
a leatherbuddy! there's no limit to what i can do with this. fear not, m'lady! captain dash superstud is here with his small tool!
oh, it's heartfelt. there's no escaping that. thanks, honey.
no, no, no, it's great. i'm done with it now.
it's not my fault! lousy magnet.
yeah, but i know how to win women back. i even won you back after i lost our wedding album in a bar bet.
her first words! play along. it's fifty cents less for babies!
how you doin'? so... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?
does it still keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold?
oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. it's a little harder to shut up.
i don't know. what happened to the last safety salamander?
i can do that!
yeah. now, i'm off to bring safety to springfield elementary and win back your love!
then what protects you if we crash?
did i hear "where are the fireworks?" 'cause heeere they are!
every man for himself! trample if you must! safety... safety... die for safety.
now honey, you know daddy's not allowed in the zoo anymore.
but i'll never stop trying to redeem myself in your eyes.
no, she's not.
only three?
that's more like it!
please, you're embarrassing me.
are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? i read an email that said there was.
hmmm. i will run for mayor!
and i'll find out what a mayor does! expand my brain, learning juice!
marge, without this outfit, i'm just homer simpson, multiple felon. with it, i'm a costumed hero like george washington or dame edna. today marks a new dawn for springfield. this salamander is sitting on eggs labeled "elder care", "flex-time," and "downtown pedestrian mall." and those eggs are ready to hatch!
why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago? now, restaurant matchbooks for everyone!
hey, people may not love homer simpson, but they love this suit. just like they love their stupid american flag.
it's the smell of impending victory.
a little.
but aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
that's weird. he started off as an egg.
that's an excellent question, kent. first of all... what the? it must have shrunk when my wife washed it!
please, stop throwing fruit!
whups, be careful of my tail.
i still feel it. it's so itchy. itchy...
hey! nobody pushes around my precious bundle of joy! whoops, wrong one. i'll take that... too slow, drooly joe... peek-a-boo! i steal from you!
silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!
ladies. marge, is there a small rip in my pants?
we throw those out anyway.
it's a risk i'll have to take.
i wish. i made these at work. hmmm. i bet she'd be a good friend for marge. she looks defeated too! psst. psst!
marge... in a gang? what're you gonna do, shoot me with a frosting gun? seriously, i would love that.
wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our "peterson's field guide to birds" on the kitchen counter? roadrunners are real!
now, let's see what marge is up to. "recipes," "dress patterns," "toaster undercoating agreement"... "heist plans"! burns' mansion?! that's mr. burns' mansion!
marge, i wanted to save you from the cops, but the cops followed me! game over, man! game over! so, are you gonna introduce me to your friends?
oh, well... i try to have a good time.
and tell me i'm not fat.
charge! i mean, yes sir?!
a lamborgotti fasterossa? that's the car i think about when i make love to my wife.
can i take my family?!
do i have to hang out with them?
that flag is mine! don't mess with texas! shock and awe, losers! shock and awe!
now we have to drive it straight to rome, where it'll be shipped to mr. burns in springfield.
why you little...
eh, there's a picture of it on my cup.
savages.
let me check the navigation system... it says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.
don't worry. we got the cheese insurance.
nooooo!
hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?
it's a lamborgotti fasterosa xt 550 with abs sport tech package.
i honor you and your country.
yes, tell us your story. but it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. and you'd better make us root for the protagonist.
okay, so far i'm rootin' for ya.
holy moley! i always thought you were, you know, "out loud and proud."
yeah, i tell marge everything! not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such.
all right, bob. we won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car.
i thought i was doing donald trump.
prego? i love you, marge.
mr. burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties.
what am i supposed to use it for -- transporting water to distant urban centers?! uh-oh. lazy romans.
opera? they have that here too?
can i be the phantom of the opera?
i know, and he's magic!
hey, knock it off.
maybe he's cheating on us with the episcopalians. look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky eucharist. i wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font.
did anyone order a hero? okay, christmas, christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a christmas card with his home address on it? what's up with that?
oh, it's never anybody's decision... anyhoo... i'd like to tell you all a little story i call "the first christmas."
i know, it's weird, isn't it?
i said we're free!
that's great! now i'll just get my present for you. which is... right outside the door. oh my god, i forgot to get marge a present!
i don't care what that letter said. this man raised me single-handedly. when i think of all the things he's done for me... the many times he... lifeguard, huh?
the only tummy ache is in my head. i can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
uh yes, i'm a reporter with the local paper. i'm doing a story on people who... wear sweaters. do you mind if i ask you some questions?
interesting. interesting.
so, you don't have any shrunken heads?
uh... you know it's a boat, right?
i'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.
no... i said i work for a radio station. nine-eighty on the am dial but number one with our viewers!
i found this letter you wrote to my mom, mona simpson.
possible daddy! i'm sorry... i got a little carried away there.
hm, honey, you've given me a lot to think about... tomorrow, when we're on daddy's boat!
wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?
woo hoo!
and my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
ha-ha! that's what you get for being luminous, jerks!
oh, which way did mason go? that must be him over there.
that is so sweet.
dad...
wait. can we have a moment in private?
as i lay dying on the ocean floor, i remembered everything you've done for me. to hell with that stupid dna test and its ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, nine, seven per cent accuracy -- you're my dad, and i love you.
only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else. aw, dad.
send up two hams! hey, this one's cold!
teach me that the stove is hot.
but i'm not tired!
hey guys, i have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then i'll be back to go to vegas!
boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system.
i don't tell your mother how much i've lost.
why, there must be some mistake.
you mean fun homer? i'm afraid serious homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
it's no use.
boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act.
at least you have something you're good at. i'm thirty-eight years old, drivin' a crappy car, with a son who doesn't respect me, and i'm one snickers pie away from losing my foot to diabetes. mmm, snickers pie.
look at me, i use a napkin.
i bet they're from massachusetts. you know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son.
don't forget to wash your hands, shakespeare.
yeah, i'll have the smiley-face breakfast special. uh, but could you add a bacon nose? plus bacon hair, bacon mustache, five o'clock shadow made of bacon bits... and a bacon body.
why you little... i'm stuck! ow! someone's hitting my butt with something!
shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are. i'll kill you! i'll kill your whole family! kidding! i'm kidding! we can do that, we have a special friendship. i'm gonna double kill you! and then i'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. then i'll dig you up and kill you again! that's the beauty of a shallow grave. you sweet little angel. oh, i'm gonna rip your head off. and spit down your adorable little neck. because i wanna smash your little stupid head. oh, but i love you we'll go on a fishing trip. but first i'm gonna put you on a sawmill then punch your little face out. that's what i'm gonna do!
i don't enjoy it. being a father is just a job. long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling "you screwed me up"!
hey, i enjoy you plenty. talking time is over.
i miss bart! i can't leave him in that awful camp! i'm comin', boy! i bet this looks cool from overhead though.
stupid horse! it's a deer crossing! wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!
son, i'm doing something i should have done a long time ago... taking you to vegas!
and don't you try to stop us.
uh, marge. me and bart got in a fight with this really un-cool pit boss, and now we're in nevada state prison. also, i don't know where bart is. if you see him, say "hey."
marge, i ripped my pants! the only pants that understand my complex hiney.
i paid for fifty laps and i'm gonna take them!
oh, wouldn't it be adequate?
through an advertising campaign so fresh and exciting, i haven't even thought of it yet.
how long is this commercial anyway?
huh?
it's called "headvertising." it creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media.
blue pants! blue pants!
fine. i'm getting blue pants in the morning / ding dong the zipper's gonna shine...
well, it did its job. everyone's wearing blue pants now.
earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. except the maine potatoes one. it's just a reminder to myself.
i'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
why you little...!
don't leave me! i hate to be alone! except when i'm watching tv, then leave me alone. but right now, don't leave!
will you tell me a story?
wait, wait, wait, wait...
huh?
gotcha.
i'm bald!
sure! you're gonna be all "i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid!"
boy, come here and listen to lisa's story. it's about moe's treasure!
hey moe! thanks to you, i've been sober a week!
well, it was very moving, but the thing is, bats are chewing my legs! oh, why did i lead you down here to find those stupid coins?
i deduced from his parody lyrics that he was hiding gold in the cave. i figured he'd never miss two or three pieces. money which we could use to pay for bart's operation.
that's a story for another day.
it's a lot of little stuff. god has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave saturn?
'cause he wants it.
hey... that's the same thing you said to bart after he choked in that soccer game. and we both know he sucked.
just put it in the trunk and leave.
a canoe made of country ham? you know i'll eat it.
i heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
don't pressure me. i get enough of that from my dad.
old man flanders!
springfield high football rules! no one turn on the sprinklers, okay?
fine. as soon as i finish watching my show.
sad? you're crazy. i feel like i'm at the oscars for the animals i forgot existed.
my son's been ape-napped!
aren't you gonna do something?
but she'll leave the rest of him alone?
i know what you think: when stupid homer wasn't looking, bart got kidnapped by a monkey.
and now i'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later i can say that i already told you.
oh, you're so right. i guess i should be more concerned with bart's safety than covering my own butt. and maybe i'm talking like this because i can't stop. help me, lisa! i have serious mental problems!
bart! bart! when the monkey falls asleep, i'll sneak you out in this trash bag. then i'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze.
lisa, monkeys don't have feelings. if they did, then my experiments could be called cruel.
marge, toot-toot and her son escaped!
mr. teeny?!
why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? i like your hat, sweetie.
what?! next you'll be telling me he didn't meet woody woodpecker!
lenny, this tv is amazing. if you're not careful, i might just spend the rest of my life on your couch.
you're right, lenny. i... lenny! bring me a beer and your deepest chamber pot! chop-chop!
later, if i have enough energy, we can walk up to the tv and i'll show you how thin it is.
wow, i can actually feel the heat.
can you at least take a picture of me with the tv?
oh yeah, good times.
oh marge! i love you! i love you! i love you!
the big screen tv?
all expenses paid?
hey, funny man, say something funny!
don't lean out of the tra--
are you kidding? take a look at my dvd. they'll never let me near lake havasu again.
i'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
oh marge, you're the greatest mom ever. i want the whole world to see that.
oh really? bart, when did you get your tenure?
i'll bet the twist is he's gay.
because we'll be on tv, and earn enough money to buy a tv. tv.
yes, tv-sa?
listen up, stonehenge. i made a drawing of the places on marge you can't touch. especially the hair.
i see. well, i should be getting to the living room...
well, he didn't get the prize pig at the fair, either.
yeah, that's how i feel about notre dame football.
i don't know why i ever married that woman.
oh marge, thank god you're back! she made me spend time with the kids. and not just tv time. talking time!
maggie? she's in her crib.
so it would appear. however, cousin it, there, was born a woman.
yeah, well, i'm gonna vote "no" on thirty-eight so you can't adopt. kidding! kidding! i don't vote! the polling place is up a hill and i never make it! you make me laugh / you make me cry / without you i'd just / want to die / for the rest of my life / you'll be a fixture / now let me enjoy / your picture in picture... and marge, you're pretty great too.
i'll show you all. i'm gonna spearhead the hell out of this expansion bid!
marge, meet pro football's newest team: the springfield meltdowns! plus i designed a state-of-the-art stadium. we'll fund it with corporate naming rights. it's the duff beer-krustyburger-buzz cola-costington's department store-kwik-e-mart-stupid flanders park! so... homer do good?
maybe he's thinking of a new shape for the football.
you mean...
yeah, you're right. y'ello. you want my opinion on current movies?! well, first of all, they're all perfect. also: when's the cap'n crunch movie coming out? and will it be "r" or "hard r"?
lisa's right! it is a cool, super sport!
ooh, a penny. this is my lucky day.
hurry up and kill it! i have to be at the opera by seven!
woo hoo! i win! in your face, best friends!
hey, marge it's what i've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury.
oh my god, you're right! i'd better call the guy. send someone right over! ooh, here he is. yeah, well while i'm gone, you'll do what he says.
i'll miss you kids too.
woo hoo! a book? oh, the cereal's just a metaphor.
thanks, sweetie. i've never been less angry to receive a book.
lisa! it's me! i'm in trouble!
a cow took my ipod and i punched it!
finally.
uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... did i say "um"?
just outsource it to lisa. outsourcing is the answer to everything.
outsourcing!
you're giving me absolute power?!
i'm not a god. god has a white beard and invented the da vinci code.
hmmm, let's see. you got the elephant man, johnny six-arms, papa smurf... these guys are pretty cool. maybe i am one of them. if only i had some kind of proof. i won a free soda! i am a god!
silence! now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant.
it's... um... jannnn... febbbb... marrr...
may firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
well, i'm just glad i'm not a god anymore. i wanna go home. how's chief wiggum?
yeah, he's funny.
my life's work ruined.
outta my way, you god-fearing buckleheads! hide me! please, you've gotta help me! if they find me they'll kill me.
oh lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me.
so, thou art a widow, eh?! then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee.
stupid flandish. uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little bible-thumping in the crow's nest? what do you say, miss...
she's gonna marry him 'cause he wears boots instead of blackening his feet.
why thee little...
may i escort you to the railing?
but baby, a man has needs.
people, this is madness! we can burn the witch later! right now, i've got to save this ship! hey, i've been driving drunk since i was twelve! but first...who's gonna help me pee?
don't worry, marge. i'll see to it you fundamentalist christians live to take over all america by the twenty-first century!
land ho!
well, i guess we have time for my tale of moist adventure. it takes place in a dark time for mankind when madness and ignorance ruled: "the nineteen seventies."
i've got an idea: climb into my mouth. nooooo! catch me, flanders!
woo hoo! it's almost new year's! ten... nine... eight...
...three... two... one... happy new year! my resolution is to be more fun!
don't tell me what to do.
or will ever do.
hey, it says here "the book" was written by tom stoppard. this isn't a book, it's a play! book.
hey, check it out, i'm scratcher or something.
which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles...
hey, who's the rude dude with the attitude?
you seem cool. wanna catch a movie?
well, uh... uh... honey, you're just as smart as a man. sometimes when i'm with you, i feel like i'm doing it with a dude.
fine! i'll finish it myself. and don't think i'm gonna screw it up, because i won't!
but sweetie, i just wanted to tell the '74 oakland a's how i felt about them.
my work here is done.
on second thought, i am brenda wine cooler.
son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, entertainment weekly. now, for once, i'm getting' rich-person mail. you wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?
okay weingartens, what else is in your mail? ooh! marge, you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?
take that, liberal media.
jogging?!
sweet!
jogging?
i'm your husband!
i do eat a lot of crap.
great news, marge -- we're goin' home.
why you little...
yeah, but he's cool with it. right?
those "freaks," as you call them, are some of our closest friends.
yes, now you do.
i'd better get ready -- i'm next! all right, marge... time to remember admiral awesome!
why do you remember them and not me?
when a man and a woman love each other very much, they--
but what if we...
you used to love my non sequiturs!
oh no, bart and lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!
so beautiful. i wish i could understand italian.
just wait. we're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
oh you loved it -- especially when the windmill came around and whacked your but.
no, it was the happiest night of my life! the warm spring air, the swings i took in the batting cage afterwards... don't you remember, darling?
marge, i realize you've made up your mind, and i want you to know that i deeply respect your boo!
i know. i just thought maybe... boo!
well, the rest of your life for sure.
marge?
you just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. in ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. and there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. and you blew her off.
really? well she's still great!
uh, yeah. i started when you were in the hospital. i was so worried. recently i tried this thing called "beer." and...
but do you also remember that you're an enabler?
and her.
what about him?
yeah, i have their baseball cards.
look at all those people. you know them?
not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with richard sakai.
oh, he ain't gettin' married. he has commitment issues!
when you get to third base, i'll buy ya a beer.
all right. just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
don't start the exhibit without me!
aw dude, i was totally here. you calling me a liar? in front of my kids? 'cause i'd take a bullet for you, man. right in my mouth!
oh, no you don't! i'm everywhere.
wow, this 3-d is amazing! you can actually feel the vase!
good riddance. their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
my mind is always open to new ideas. onions in the peas! what the hell?
this is the break in the case we've been waiting for!
poor bambi... poor thumper...
thanks, marge. it's not a twist-off! c'mon...
c'mon! open! i want what's in you!
you, stupid...
oh wait, it was a twist-off.
don't worry, i'll use the money i make to buy tickets from a scalper. then i'll sell those tickets, and we'll be rich! rich! we did it, baby! we made it through the rain! tickets, thirty dollars! big game, everyone wants to see the game... cop! act like you're in love with me.
bart! hand me that sack of batteries! nine volt! double a! d!-d!-d!-d! cordless drill!
look at that ugly old man.
really? you'd kiss an ugly old man like me?
buck mitchell!
yes, yes. the game you played so horribly at.
season tickets?! i could entertain business clients. i might even land the henderson account!
sure. that means she wants to talk in private. it's probably about you.
that's just how i feel.
buck mitchell!
sorry i'm late! i was just gathering my counseling equipment. now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till i say so.
wow, i think we've really hit on something here. unfortunately, we're out of time. how does that make you feel? shut up, my ten o'clock's here.
good idea, honey. buck, would you mind signing a couple of baseballs for my boy?
just sign your name above president lincoln's.
and i say a monkey can mow our lawn!
i stole a rack of fur coats. i sell one a year to pay for christmas.
like i always say: compromise is the key.
let's compromise and say nobody said it.
oh, you're so hot. if only i'd seen you before i met my wife.
don't tell the hamburger in my car.
oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock.
cancellations require twenty-four hours no-tice.
yeah, they beat me up at work. look at the word they wrote on my skull.
i didn't want you to learn that word this way. marge, we've gotta get buck and tabitha back together. this is the most important case of our careers!
but i wanted to do it with you.
uh... she was here a minute ago. she must be pooping.
great. but enough of the baseball analogies. they sicken me.
now, m'lady, your carriage awaits.
whyba youba doba thatba?
mmm, this must be what angels taste like!
why can't you do anything?
dirt nap, eh? hm...
this is all my daughter's fault. but i'll make it up to you. bart and i will run your business till your dad's okay.
everything. and i learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: "shark tale".
leave him to me. ow! i hurt my fist and my palm. i thought you guys were lookin' out for me. all right, tap jockey, you owe fat tony fifty bucks. cough it up!
just get the money.
it'll do for now.
uh, it fell off a truck. you know, a truck-truck.
no problem. i'll be back in ten minutes.
you monster! just cut his achilles tendon with this knife.
can i still talk with my hands?
what about with my ears?
lady. man. lady. man. lady.
hey, if i poisoned them, would i be doing this?
spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! just give us the pills. clear-cut his brain down to the nub! thank you, doctor. marge?
i know -- i'll use that white-noise machine i got you when your father died. transport yourself to the shores of nova scotia, where cod and halibut frolic in--
so it's a noise war he wants, huh? then i'll throw in some rush-hour traffic! and a circus fire! sleep tight, my angel!
boy, get dressed. you're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!
woo hoo! what's next? a contract with groove-tone records? take the g-train, baby. groove-tone!
oh, son. i like you more, now that other people like you.
and then today at lunch lenny and i went to the park and rented a rowboat. carl sketched us from the bank. summer days.
and what about my new job as a mexican wrestler? beware of el taco belly! no mas! no mas!
uh, no. sorry if it sounded like i did.
i guess.
deal!
don't tell me how many times to think!
we already own a book!
cool, a carpenter's library! this doesn't look easy, but i'll bet it is.
oh yeah? blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah...
i did! i made a foot rest.
you sure are, sweetie -- i love this bed you made.
yep, it'll do that. simpsons manly-man handyman at your service.
no problem. why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while i get to work. marge, the coast is clear.
oh, uh, that was me. you know that old saying: "measure like a girl, hammer like a guy."
...annnd done.
listen... what would you say if i told you a woman did most of the work?
uh... like all manly men, i have a vivid imagination.
that shirley is quite a gal. we should fix her up with barney.
he wants to grind his own corn. maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal. switch!
who'd you think would help me, my wife? heh.
look, i understand that you're mad. which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old springfield roller coaster. by the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. if the kids ask, i did it.
hmm... let me mull that over. what are struts? i don't know anything about struts.
maybe i can sneak home without them seeing me.
sweetie, you don't understand. if i can do this myself, then all those lies i told will be true. don't you want daddy's lies to be true?
to daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day.
and now i give you... the zoominator!
sure, i'll tell them the truth... the truth is that i'm perfect and everything i touch is perfect!
i've never felt saferrrr! uh-oh. oh. why must we preserve america's historic roller coasters? thank you honey! everyone! my stupid male pride made me lie to you. everything i claiiimed i did was actually built by maaarge!
avenge me!
hey, that's great. let's look at it after.
if he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?
marge, i ate it, it's over. oh no you don't!
son! let me have a lick at you.
nag, nag, nag.
i'll savor you!
no.
must eat more fat people. thank god i'm in america!
i used to think these shirts were just for fat slobs.
you're right. starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner.
that's ridiculous, talking fudge.
marge! i missed you! all this eating has put me in the mood for a little lovin'.
what happened to "for better or for worse?!"
marge, to keep you in my life, i'd do anything. there must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community.
what's goin' on?
yeah, get him a woman. that'll end his misery! this hurts so much.
writing's for nerds.
flanders?
so, it's a war of the worlds. good thing we've got the sun on our side. go ahead and hide, you coward!
that's alien talk!
lisa, that was just a radio show.
sorry, guys. you know, his mother's the one who made me come down here.
go on.
wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?
woo hoo! where do i sign? now where's my parade? where's my parade?
i have to marge. who else is gonna keep oil under a hundred dollars a barrel? you? don't make me laugh! you couldn't-- aw, no, daddy's just teasing. of course you could. you could keep it under a hundred. yes, you could. no she couldn't.
are you gonna ask us our major malfunctions? 'cause mine is i care too much.
snowflake?! what happens to me in the summer?
i don't understand. how does punishing them teach me a lesson?
can you say "side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?" hm, sounded better in my head.
everyone got an assignment but us. i wonder what makes us so special.
that's an odd way to start handing out medals.
are we that stupid?
i will! stay crunchy, men! stay crunchy!
bring it on, chumps! fingers, fingers, fingers!
moe, moe, you gotta hide us from the army!
not that army, the one from "stripes!"
well, what have we got? rise my pretties! find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!
yeah, marge always loves your cards. well, you may not be the smartest guys in the army...
h means "hot"?!
predator drone!
oh, i was supposed to take moe fishing today! everybody hide!
says you.
whoa, marge, who'd you piss off?
moe, you live in a hotel? you're just like "eloise"!
ooh, you love a man!
do not mention that publication in this house! they never published my poem! there once was a rapping tomato / that's right, i said rapping tomato / he rapped all day / from april to may / and also, guess what, it was me.
fine. i'll drive between sips. they got an open bar at this thing, right? wow. troopers from every state in new england.
it's gonna be awesome! man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses.
oh i'm sorry. we should exchange insurance information. i have none.
make my daughter cry, will ya! eat syrup, jerk!
no, not now.
i thought we were playing cincinnati time-waste.
you're not ice cream... faker! ice cream man! wait!
one butter-crusted choco-rocket, please.
yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. change a hundred?
nooooo!
wait a minute. you don't want the truck, i need a job, you need money, i'm flush with severance pay...
why, doesn't he need it? oh, right.
well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!
he was following my design. and now to get dressed in a most unusual way:
what's the matter, son? don't you have enough money for ice cream?
son, i will not stand for intolerance! you give this delightful frozen treat the same respect you would give any lactose-free food. god bless america!
i said, god bless america!
ooh! thomeone wearth a brathelet. who'th your boyfriend? dr. osterberg?!
honey, i brought you more sticks.
it's good to see you smile again. i was lonely being happy all by myself.
let me just put on some romantic music.
marge, everything looks wonderful! well, i'm off to pedal my frosty wares!
i would never let you down. our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. and trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. in cone-clusion, here's the scoop: i love you.
sorry, i'm all out of ice cream.
marge's show!
i made it back for your show, honey...
well excuse me for having enormous flaws that i don't work on!
marge, where are you? did you change your name? is it kelly? kelly!!!
oh my god. she's gonna jump. marge, don't do it! give divorce a chance!
the world's not that interested!
i just have one question, my darling: what did you do with all the ice cream that was on all those sticks?
yeah? well i wish i'd married patty and selma!
you used to love it! recording that fake fight was a great idea.
and, as always, have fun watching. goooo... lovemaking! and i hate the cutesy way you make jack-o-lanterns! i like scary halloween, not funny halloween!
son, we all have to do things we don't want to. like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be mr. funny all the time -- you think i wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? like some ancient pagan! just dancing around playing the pan flute! and here we are!
yeah. how'd you afford this kick-ass party?
woo hoo! marital sex! okay, tucked in tight, glass of water, nightlight on, no barn owls, don't do drugs, love you, good night.
but your mother smells like coconut! okay sweetie, which book should i read?
tomorrow? but she's in trouble now! i'll just read ahead without you.
oh, of course. whatever you say, sweetie. nighty-night.
lady, you're nice, but i'm married.
ow! i can't read ahead -- i promised lisa i wouldn't!
he killed greystash!
uh... how would you feel if something bad happened to greystash?
angelica was trapped in the suffoclock of sandy doom...
greystash looked krubb right in the eye and said...
uh, they went to star wars land and fought star wars.
now lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
don't say his name! in your mouth it sounds like dirt!
no man should outlive his fictional wizard! no man!
look out! it's the grumple!
give back that holiday cheer, you bastard!
you're getting a cab, old man. in fact, i believe i see it now.
your present is leaving.
do you think that's the same grumple from the ice show? because i do.
christian charity? what does a porn star have to do with this? he's gotta go!
really? who's gonna make him?
he sure has a lot of markers that don't work.
lower the boom!
has the boom been lowered?
oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors.
marge, admit it -- you just can't say "no" to anyone. that's why you have three kids.
yeah, but there's something else. there's this loser staying in our house. marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does.
well, i guess i'll have to wait for marge to show some backbone and-- you again?! what the hell is this thing?
those legs go on forever. oh wait, they stop right there.
a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
their drunken singing is ruining st. patrick's day!
scottsdale? will we stay at a tripletree resort?
then forget it!
gunderson!
a hundred and seventeen degrees! ooo, that reminds me. there's water under the seat!
i've never seen marge want to go somewhere so badly. i'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a dvd.
oh marge, i'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate.
you could caramel my arm...
it's not sugar, it's caramel!
i bet it was bill clinton's fault.
slick willie wiggles out of another one.
oh, i can't stand to see your mother unhappy. but this town could be great for your mother again. and i know three people who can make it happen.
all night long, baby.
a green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:
i think the hook is touching my brain. .
queer strange or queer gay?
finally. something even i wouldn't eat. well, maybe a little more. terrible.
uh... i thought today was opposite day. by the way, you're very ugly. it's opposite day.
so that means... it is opposite day.
i don't know what to say.
aw, son.
you did the right thing, boy.
uh... sure we will, son. right, captain?
should i hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?
why you little...
the hell we are!
well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly... oh my god! it's beautiful!
wait a minute. how am i breathing?
i can't go back to living on the surface world! i can't! then they brought us home...
you're all idiots. i'm putting it on chill thunder lite.
hey! nobody cuts me off!
then what's america doing in iraq?
treason?! but i love france! the way all our words are either a girl or a guy! oh, that's the best!
i don't want the kids to see me this way!
you moron! i'm already alive!
are you gonna torture me?
revenge! okay.
where did you come from?
oh sorry, i wasn't listening. i was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. lookin' good.
and decrepit.
so this map leads to a treasure, huh? i wonder how long this tunnel...
madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen.
little do you know that the count of monte cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
i have returned!
yes, my love?
you guys liked him?
but marge, i did it all for you!
it takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! plus, in the middle, i had to take revenge on some of my contractors.
is it "the count of monte cristo?" 'cause i love that story.
no, sweetie. the lesson is: never put down your weapon. revenge!
this is it. it's taken all day, we've missed our flight to hawaii, but finally, i'll get my revenge.
you? you're too dumb to tell a story. no, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it.
you don't frighten me! or my wife! or my...
avenge me. in flamboyant impractical fashion.
that's okay, boy. the two of us got to talking.
two.
now what do they want?
camera's broken!
floor it!
whoa, you just blew my mind!
aw, my little girl's just like cbs news.
hold on there, boy. if you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight. this cell phone is so i can call you whenever i need your driving services. i've put in my own ring tone! hello, bart? i need you to go the gas station. tell them you need to inflate your tires, but actually you inflate these volleyballs. then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.
bart... buddy! it's your dad! i need a ride! i think i'm in chinatown. not our chinatown.
boy, i don't wanna freak you out, but i'm calling from inside the trunk. that was me. some very un-cool people put me in here.
bart! this is a matter of life and death: what is the difference between ketchup and catsup? they're gonna cut my head offff...!
you know, my great-great grandmother was an indian. i guess i should've mentioned that before, huh?
simpson men get the job done! it's a tragedy, a real tragedy. i mean, what kind of tramp gets knocked up before she's even married?
i mean in this day and age, when the link between sex and pregnancy has been proven so... conclusively in... scientific american, where...
why would i go to utah? i love booze, caffeine, and monogamy.
did she mention she was knocked up?
oops. sorry for the spoiler.
yeah, how 'bout that?
thanks, boy. hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while i sing public domain songs out the window?
the light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea. eh?
why do you sound so shocked? this is our fifth take.
now that i'm super-wealthy, i can buy them whatever their hearts desire. that's why rich kids turn out so well.
uh, this is eduardo, my pool boy. he thinks he's an angry rich man.
that's the pool chemicals talking.
please, mr. burns, pretend you work for me. you can have the boy, just don't beat him. you can beat him, just don't leave marks.
i'll tell you why. it's been another eight years, and what do i have? same job, same house, same dirty joke book...
wow. i have a pretty good life after all.
relax, marge. i wasn't gonna kill him. all those years i was dreaming of other things, i was actually doing what i really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking! marge, you're my real dream come true. and i get to live you every day.
relax, baby. while you were dreaming of me and calling me "james," i took care of everything.
eh, stumbled home at dawn, same diff. now don't worry: i packed everyone's lunches and sent them off into the world.
he's lying!
look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!
marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. because i've got a plan...
yes i do. under chapter thirteen of the fiscal code, an individual whose debts exceed his assets may file for bankruptcy, thus protecting said assets.
of course, you idiot, 'cause i'm wishing for more money.
i've got three bathrooms, don't i? next.
give it here, i'll find some fat we can trim. here you go, a giant useless expense for something that no one is interested in.
no, no. this place is too expensive. i saw you doing a "five-hundred piece" jigsaw puzzle in there! come on, dad, i'm cuttin' back everywhere. to save gas i'm "flintstone-ing" the car.
sure, but i think you're exaggerating the problem.
he was a great dad! every year he got so mad when santa didn't bring me presents.
well, here we are, home early.
a talking bear is eating my father!
oh, why did i borrow that roof from him?
oh, now you're dragging hot dogs into this. real classy, marge. real classy.
words hurt, you know.
oh great. who are you in love with? bart?
selma!
hola, i am esteban de la sexface. that means stephen of the sexface.
dos selmas? ay-yi-yi!
i guess i always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
nooooooo...
oh lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet. hey selma, want some rice?
then i must flee! where is he? where is he? i smell his aftershave!
where is he? i know he's in here.
e-z blo... this ends now!
uh-huh... uh-huh...
or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
yeah, but uh-- one of those i dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but i was too embarrassed to admit it, so i set the house on fire. it feels good to tell the truth. no, i'm lying again, it feels bad.
tick tock, sweetie.
i'm going with the cologne i wore on our first date.
oh, captain janeway! your mission ended too soon! too soon...
here i am on the space shuttle, orbiting earth.
moderately wealthy?
that's quite an offer -- can i discuss it with my wife?
then i'll do it!
krusty! how 'bout a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?
okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?
okay boy, do something annoying. but leave yourself room to build.
oh, like you care, betty white.
her name is marge.
no problem. hey drederick!
your hip hop cd was boastful and unnecessary!
what are the first three?
okay.
well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals.
kids. they always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.
see marge, everyone says they hate these magazines, but it's impossible to set them down.
did i attach the harness?
up, up, and annoy!
he's trying to make me look like a bad father. maggie, take the wheel! ten and two, einstein! can't i even have privacy here?!
you're right -- i'm giving up photography... and my own medicine! so long, anti-clotting agent! clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!
you guys are right -- i should get back in the game. but i threw away my camera.
nothing.
ooh, papa john's.
never!
why don't i just put on a dress?!
do i have to?
did someone say "snack"? i'll be your ref!
i got fired from foot locker. what'sa matter, buddy? the american flag not good enough for ya?
i'm your father now. i'm open! i'm open! so... tired.
thanks, honey. after what you said to me, i watched hours and hours of soccer. i almost saw a goal! but there were so many ads for spanish cell phones...
i said foul on twenty-three!
well i'm throwing you both out of the game!
foul on the other girl. lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!
ronaldo?! winner of two world cups and three fifa player of the year awards?
yellow card!
when i put on these shorts, i'm not your father anymore. and judging by how tight they are, i'm never gonna be anyone else's either.
un-sportsman-like conduct. that's a red card. you're out of the game!
you said it -- enjoy me while i last.
wanna watch me?
lisa's mad at me and marge is mad at him.
yeah. what have you done with the real moe?
but to get that dvd i had to become a pbs subscriber! now i'm paying for crap like american masters!
those places are pretty terrible.
i sure do.
my son caught the ball! this makes up for everything that's gone wrong in my life or ever will!
there must be another chair.
i guess i could just sit on a bed...
sure feels weird lying on top of the covers. sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.
how many?!
i don't work here.
woo hoo!
but it did happen. just yesterday, in crazytown.
knock it off! he's just a kid!
marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago.
oh yeah, let's see where that goes.
a common problem. try this.
sex problem, eh?
and remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. okay, who else is dead in bed?
what's wrong with it?
oh, i think i know what you're doing wrong. have you tried...
i'll write you a check.
wrong, wrong, wrong!
yeah... something has changed, but i can't figure out what. our mattress! i traded it to the lovejoys!
it was made for elvis, but he found it tacky. i can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
lousy reverend. he's having my sex! while i'm at home with marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
sorry.
well, excuse me, for being a powerful yet careless lover.
you would be.
or a chicken club... or a reuben... or a monte cristo... or a... pull over behind that billboard!
i couldn't find maggie's brand, but i got every other kind i could find. how about "syntho-nip?" kiddy cork? "thumbstitute?" "accuteat?" "bink 182?" wanna suck on the receipt?
good work, boy. just for that, we're gonna treat your heart murmur, not just "see how it goes." stupid baby... growing her brain... on my dime!
mm-hm.
that's ridiculous. if i had set up those dominoes, i'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads.
mood swings?! mood swings. mood swings! mood swings? mood swings! mood swings! mood swings! mood swings! mood swings, mood swings! mood swings! nappien, you did it again! and everything is as it should be. john lennon?! yoko?
well son, your uncle homer is, like eighty percent of america, whacked-out on prescription drugs.
you're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.
because i'm filled with stress! i have three kids and no money! why can't i have no kids and three money?
zombie file grievance.
zombie montage:
what the?! my car?! milhouse?! nutmeat?!
what are you, a travel agent? 'cause you're sending me on a guilt trip.
i can't! that fire siren could sound at any moment.
woo hoo! marge, when you see me next i'll be a soggy, smoky hero. mmm, soggy, smoky hero.
don't tell me how to do my job!
we don't get what?
hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes.
i hope it's spaghetti!
lousy burns so ungrateful, i hate him so much...
well... most of it.
yeah, we're awesome. this'll make a great toilet seat!
just what are you getting at?
look at me! i'm a fireman!
look at me, guys! i'm stealing five segways at once! and speaking of segues, i'm off to my next morally questionable activity!
make them stop!
moe, i think we may have perverted...
we sent it to skid row where it would do the most good.
you stuffed your horn?!
betcha can't solve our maze? i didn't come here to be insulted. we're leaving! sure is a lot of corn in this parking lot.
split up?! marge, no! we can fix this marriage!
fine, you want out? then go! i can make it on my own! before i met you i had friends and dreams!
oh please take me back. the dating scene is a nightmare. i'm begging you!
of our marriage?! i don't want to live! hey, this maze is made of corn! i'm so sick of being lost. to hell with maze etiquette! i'm walking straight outta here!
i'm lost and i'm starving!
i don't have any holders!
"to my wife marge -- in case i don't make it, here are my oscar picks for next year: best sound effects editing, the team from--"
all right.
now that he's had a taste of human flesh, the dog will be a slave to its succulence! look at him eyeing me -- he knows i taste best.
oh relax, marge, i'm just messin' with ya. i know i'm not a dog. i'm a people, like you.
cheer up, boy. we'll get you their most vicious street cur! he'll bite your ass raw!
why you little... i'll teach you to trick your sister!
well, i can breathe out okay. don't... give snake... attention... it's what... he really... wants. i'm okay.
hey, get your own yogurt!
woo-hoo! business trip!
i'm still alive! you call that playing to win?!
okay, milhouse, what do you want to do?
ol' betsy'll get us there.
cops! act natural! hello, officer!
all the other moms gave their husbands twenty.
i had to fight! lenny said his dad is hulk hogan, and i know he's not!
ooh, a thermos! with seven cups of coffee still in it! oh wait, six!
here! it's yours!
okay, here we go.
what'd you say?
all right, everybody. squeeze in real tight. i wanna get us all in the picture this time. closer. closer. okay. hold still. this is the last picture on the role.
you watch your mouth you little smartass.
bart! this one's gonna be the simpsons at our finest. smile. look cheerful. here we go... here we go... here we go. why you little...
hey suckers, check it out. marge is taking me to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery.
why the cemetery? i wondered. but my dreams were too strong.
absolutely, all the time. i go to the floss store and they're like, "whoa, there he is again." 'cause i buy so much floss.
i know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth.
i don't even have a special tooth problem! this is just a routine check-up! the bib is choking me! it's over? that wasn't so bad.
this is the greatest movie ever!
i have a right to my views.
i'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!
i like that. but i'm on a bit of a health kick, so i'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: snickles, gooey bears, charlottesville chew, nice 'n' many, kat kit, herschel's smooches, mrs. bad bar, and milk dudes.
uh... cone!
oh my god, this is amazing! wait, i'm gonna be driving. i'll go for the cup.
that's me!
i've never been to war, but i imagine it feels just like your first kill. the happiness swept me away!
well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. that makes us friends, right?
okay.
kent brockman!
i'm sorry marge, but i won't live under the same roof as a member of the "liberal media".
did you know that every day mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!
liberals -- i hate them so much!
woo hoo!
liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo hoo! liberals! woo--
hoo! woo hoo? liberals? woo hoo?
i know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. for years now, fox has been--
i'm afraid they might. but i will not be silenced. the truth is... okay. what i was going to say, was...
hey, you're not a penny.
me? but that's you!
he is not my boyfriend!
i do. my favorite is chicago deep dish.
drive to chicago? i don't have time for that. i have to be back at work on monday. and my boss is a total jerk.
i'm aroused and confused.
now make every word "beer." beer beer, beer beer / beer beer beer beer beer... um, wait, i forgot the words.
svetlana! svetlana!
i came to relax -- you think of it!
drunk!
no way -- commercial is for losers and terrorists! i flew on a private plane.
please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
i had it all for one night. now for the rest of my life i'll know what i'm missing. and all i have to remember it by is that my ears haven't popped. well, i'll make sure that i never yawn again.
high? high like a private plane? the kind i'll never be invited to ride on again.
no way. i don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or "guru".
oh, tell me more!
if you're gonna film me, i insist on a body double.
the camera's not on yet, right?
fine, i'll show you a winner, just you watch. think positive. think positive. you were saying...
will you shut up? i can't hear the song in my head!
this i can do! behold my two-seventeen average... and weep! as i said, i've lost all hope.
is this going somewhere?
i wasn't talking to you.
how many of those have private planes?
handyman's choice copper tubing?
i'm gettin' that job. bart, i'll need some clean urine. stat.
i'm gonna get there early, so i can get in good with the lunch truck guy.
one small coffee, please. and a dozen of those placemats with the maze on it.
somebody's gotta do 'em.
oh, it was great! flew to tulsa on the company jet. did my job in a way consistent with what i already told you. because that's what you do. when you have a job.
well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... i lied. i didn't get the job. you see when i got there...
um... um...c'mon, say "you're hired"!
say it!
say it!
brands like "miser's choice" and "day-old delights?"
honey, there's something i have to tell you...
no, it's, uh... good news!
we're manufacturing a new pipe diameter, five-eighths inch. the company wants you and me to take the private plane to new york for the premiere! so meet me at shelbyville airport in an hour. if i'm gonna tell that woman the truth, i'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad.
no, i said the right thing.
honey... don't try to remember the whole day. just what you're feeling this second.
marge... i've gotta be honest...
i don't know. maybe we flew through a rainbow.
i'm trying to land a plane with no experience.
duke? that's good.
vanderbilt?
what? i'll show him. i'll show that guy!
you'd think so, but no.
so long, suckers! move it! move it! move it! do you want to be second out of the parking lot? do you? leave her!
you'll never catch me, lord!
those are words.
denny's.
don't worry, we'll just go home. your mother can cook.
woo hoo!
lisa's right, son. your mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--
mmmm, au jus! not quite gravy, not quite blood...
oh, i can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!
come on, we're leaving! mmm, after one more mini-quiche...
will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?
my back! it hurts, and not in a good way!
stop that! i'm down here!
well, you're always telling me i should eat more dirt.
which grow in what?
and could i leave you / running merrily through the snow?
but i can only sing lying on my back.
oh, oh, i just have one question: what is this movie about?
excuse me, "film."
mimi! mimi!
woo-hoo!
well i didn't mean to!
oh, good. this makes up for me showing up drunk to the father-daughter dance.
wow, praise from placido domingo.
eh, i'll think about it.
thanks! you know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! no wait, i forgot about that other guy. sorry, you're third.
hmmm, what if you gave it a little more of this flavor...
but i need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. would you have me keep it fake?
my pleasure. to the hottest girls in the room.
i said you look hot! hot! ay chihuahua!
hua-hua!
and may i say i'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes? what? that's how guys talk.
you guys go on, we're gonna walk home.
not me, they love me.
a lady motorcycle driver?! what is this, the twilight zone?
marge!
um, everyone's wearing clothes in here.
uh, i'm not sure she's workin' out. that's it! let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to marge and you can never, ever have it. this opera's over when the fat man sings.
that's good. you've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. now, i think it would be best if you left. julia, wait!
who could it be? a disgruntled former employee? whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol.
get lost, you waste of a moustache!
well that's it, i'm retiring from the opera. it's just too popular. and i know something much more fun i can do on my back.
you know you make me wanna
hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
a little bit louder now!
hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
no problem. my, you've grown.
it's paint. or is it? yeah, it's paint.
at first i thought you were pointing to your crotch.
that's my car!
okay. let me just grab my registration.
but it's just you and me... that must mean i'm your boss. i'm sick of you! you're fired!
shut up! when you call in sick, who do you call?
sometimes you want to work?
street cattle?
wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. just like god.
i would love to! but i don't have a tow truck.
i'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.
uh, that's still too sexy for my wife.
...which i previously alluded... are there two "l's" in "alluded"?
why? what happens if i point it this way?
really? what's your handicap?
i'm doing my job! you're hovering over a hydrant!
outside? that's a one-hour parking zone -- and you've been here a good eighty-one minutes.
marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end.
hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be.
guess what, boy. last night i towed your principal's car.
i guess i'm more powerful than god now.
who said that? i'll kill them with my power!
what? i'm still in springfield. okay, i made a mistake. why don't you give me two demerit points in a point system we work out right now?
i thought we were friends! i was kidding you in a friendly fashion!
okay, i get it. i'm not stupid. it's number two, right?
do not worry. i am working.
ask no questions. and do not call the police, or i will kill me.
all is well. goodbye forever.
thanks to her!
right... tomorrow. think. think. you have to think, it's your job! why you little...
what?! name twelve.
american sober or irish sober?
point one oh with a stomach full of bread. my final offer.
goodnight, sweetheart.
oh, hello, marge. i'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. am i disappointed? yes. am i surprised? no.
what?! oh my god, my sweet margie! okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero.
you have a new home now... with us.
you don't owe him anything. moe was in the hospital for three weeks and i didn't visit him once.
moe the tavern, not moe the person.
hey marge, look at us -- the four amigos! they're gonna let me do some odd jobs for them on the outside.
why does he always bring up my weight?
don't worry, sir. i'll handle this cleanly, quietly and bart!
have fun at your crazy-sounding thing.
now all i have to do is think of a clever line before i pull the trigger. oh, that's a perfect one. but i don't need to say it out loud, 'cause i'm by myself. out of my way, mystery skank! hey! now i don't get paid!
great, great -- i turned over so many wheelbarrows... wait, that was your thing.
seconds, please. i'll kill her after dessert!
you ruined that pie!
how could you not tell me?
okay, here's the deal, i'll do the killing for hire, and you stay home with the kids.
i just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.
i was out getting drunk, then killing people!
why do you think i'm kicking it?
at your funeral.
oh, that was so hot! i love watching you do other guys!
that can be arranged.
oh ma-arge! want some com-pany? as always, silence means yes. how about a little neck rub, baby? now, how 'bout the neck of my butt... oh marge, your tentacles feel so good. wait a minute... why am i getting words in edgewise?
oh, i'm not decent. let me throw something on! can i help you, gentlemen?
wow, you guys are good. the alien's right here in the living room.
homer -- bored!
quiet -- we're missing the dissection!
oh, lighten up. it's halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment.
hold still! i'm trying to eat my way out from the inside!
hm, i thought i was killed by that magic spaghetti!
okay maggie, just calmly and carefully back away. beehive! blueberries!
there are so many choices. bolo? clip on? piano keys? ten commandments of beer? the cornerstones of the brewish faith.
and what color would that be?
of course i know!
uh...
marge, give me a break! i don't notice the color of people's eyes! i just judge them on the color of their skin.
spaz.
because if i do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me. sleep tight. the container store now has five convenient locations!
and we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.
good idea. i'll drown my sorrows in anchor steam beer! oh, i'm sorry!
where is it? i gotta find out what color marge's eyes are. cha-ching! oh marge darling, what's the combination to our wedding album?
boy, stop talking to yourself!
a song? wait, it's coming back to me. the girl i love's got beautiful hair / a blue bouffant from here to there snow white teeth and lips so red / she's the wilma to my fred oh the girl i love's got beautiful... eyes / when happy they sparkle, when sad they cries / those eyes are gems beyond appraisal / stunning shade of purest... oh, what is it?! i was so close! let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! oh, it's hopeless! she'll never love me again.
mmm... porkpie.
marge, i wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them? we're gonna be rich! we can finally start a family!
a better one!
i hear that.
yeah, i haven't decided what kind of new car to get.
are you sure they're not talking about cars? because those are car words.
marge won't dump me. i'm the anchor that keeps her weighed down.
that will never happen! marge! marge! a makeover! oh my god! the prophecy is being fulfilled. um, so... tell me about your day.
hey, the networks have different channels in this city.
are you happy and full of life?
old one?! they're convincing marge to dump me!
you guys gotta help me! if marge leaves i'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make.
uh-huh.
okay.
fashions.
uh-huh, uh-huh... got it. i know just what it'll take to hang onto marge.
and i know how i can knock myself out. i'll look at your bill.
kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother.
no, i had my stomach stapled! all food tastes like barf now.
welcome home, marge.
do you like guys who are... attractive?
all for you, baby.
whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. why don't you take some time to savor the front?
uh, it used to be.
ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
no, i want you to give me every other surgery you have so i can look good! and can you call it an aortic valve replacement so my insurance will cover it?
did someone order a super stud? my implants feel itchy.
you better not make me cry. 'cause i don't know where my tear ducts are anymore.
then it was all a dream. i never became a hideous monster.
i sure have. plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. when it is, everyone should get it.
aw...
no thanks -- just here for a battery.
battery, battery, battery! hmm... no... bingo! one battery, please.
sold! sucker.
my what now?
i spit on your corpse, advertiser-supported television!
sometimes i think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.
good luck, with my finicky appetite.
sold!
that's how they getcha!
more ribs for me?
finally, some service. now listen. we wanna sit under a cool state license plate -- michigan or better.
next time a commercial comes on, i'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as i can.
i'd like to know if wes doobner is aware of what you're doing in his restaurant.
nobody do it.
finally, the ribs.
he cheats at uno!
yeah, well, between you and me, i still can't stand him. i still can't stand him... i still can't stand him... i still can't stand him... i don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...
uh-huh.
yes.
no.
oh yeah!
i remember.
uh-huh.
are you done? 'cause i've been circling the funeral home for ten minutes.
hey, what smells so good?
marge, he's got to get over his fear of coffins.
yeah. the only thing that's gonna be hacked to pieces now is this celebratory cake!
a "forget-me-shot?" never heard of it.
mmm, pickle...
flanders!
the queen's private surgeonnn!
what did i do?
i'm afraid i did something to make marge and the kids leave me.
done.
how 'bout the deja viewmaster?
remembrance of things fast?
the rememberererer?
bo-ring.
ow. ow. ow!!! three, two, one. owwwww!!!
another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my tv guide? i've gotta find out who that guy is, but i need help. someone like bart, only smart. lisa!
lisa, i'm about to probe the most shattering moment of my life. you wanna join me?
well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old homer.
i'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
who was it with?
right.
the mother of my children with the reason for my children!
noooo!
wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then i'm not gonna do it.
my life's flashing before my eyes.
are you kidding? the mother of my children with the reason for my children! this is gonna be the greatest party ever!
oh my god! it's like christmas in december! let's celebrate now.
don't worry honey, i'll get you an ice pack. where's the ice pack?
this is great! i must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.
hmmm... the only problem is, i'm sure to retain some image of coming home and finding duffman. no doubt i'll misconstrue that as him placing a cuckold's horns upon my brow. and that will make me want to jump off a-- for the love of god, make sure the party boat has a moon-bounce.
and when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here.
hmmm... the only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
oh yeah. who's an angry dog? who's an angry dog?
oh no! he's talking to that mailroom guy.
listen carefully. i have taken your wife hostage. if you don't have a wife, i have kidnapped your brother. nod if you understand. now, back away from burns and i will let your dog live. good. now stop and dance like a happy prospector. happier! happier! happier!
when you ask me that it's never good.
marge, that was a joke!
i can't stand to see a grown burger cry. we must rebuild fast food boulevard! i don't know about you, but i don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where i can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. i say we rebuild the fast-food district -- bigger and better than ever!
c'mon, marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!
think tank, eh?
die hard two!
he's got my vote.
dear god. what have i done?
oh my god, they're going steady -- did everyone see that?!
that was the best milkshake ad i've ever seen. it makes me want a milkshake!
why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?
no, no. this candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous.
no. but you're close.
what i did made the tv thing happen.
lisa, being president is easy. you just point the army and shoot.
oh, the patriot act is so terrible! the government might find out what library books i take out. what's next -- finding out what operas i go to?
don't worry, kids. these wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm.
i thought global warming would take care of it. al gore can't do anything right.
things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
oh, it was a wonderful time. the iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling matt groening created "futurama," and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a tv show called "melrose place"...
i had become diabetic from drinking too many frappuccinos.
yep, that professor couldn't keep me and marge apart. i mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach.
what if i told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?
happy valentine's day, and shut your gob.
loa...ner?
wow. this is the kind of car you see in commercials! how much am i paying for this?
really? you people are idiots! that's the dumb-- what a stu-- i mean, that sounds fair.
look at you! idiots!
none.
wanna take a ride with your old man?
aw, don't give up, boy. i believe in you -- and not just because i have to.
son, i know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. but since then, i've really come to respect you. and unlike love, respect can't be bought.
that's my boy! now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!
mrs. simpson, may i take you for an evening drive? our loaner awaits!
yeah, i can't believe all those years i used to drive that old piece of... what the?!
sorry, maggie.
just gimme a minute. but feel free to go nuts on me.
but i have all those old diets i still haven't finished.
it's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!
three please!
well, they say muscle weighs more than fat.
what?! i'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
work.
i, uh, i have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. conservation of mass -- it's the law.
nothing!
c'mon, pick up, pick up! i know you're there.
sweetheart, i didn't want to deceive you. i just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes.
c'mon, boy. all the nerds are doin' it.
move or die!
but kids, i want you in bed by three a.m.
go-go or boring?
i said secret. have you ever wondered what i do in that locked room?
well wonder no more!
thanks, son.
wait, wait, wait, wait! you haven't seen our power point presentation. bart?
who could have done this?!
this can only mean one thing. flanders! you ate my jerky!
i know you ate my jerky. just like i ate your earthquake supplies! you stay right here.
that wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal.
you're on your own.
lisa! gimme that! i can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
and a very wise fish he is!
maybe you're drunk.
okay. fatherhood hurts my brain.
what'd you say?
i thought you might have trouble with this. that's why i'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. someone you'd never expect.
wrong number.
okay, bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. step one: we chuck the raccoon in there.
don't worry. i have a perfect way to conceal his identity. see? now go, boy! not keys, cigarettes! yeah, that's what i mean.
no! now practice preening to the crowd, el guapo. come on, preen harder! make them hate you! you feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!
i'll see you later, honey.
homer simpson. i know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. and i'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we americans come together.
kids, marriage is like a car. along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. with lurleen i just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. now let's return to watching the news.
i told her not to go into one of those.
confederate degenerate?
boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks.
how could a man just abandon his family? by which i mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it? where you going?
wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a dad too lazy to run away! and he has hair! bart, get me my suicide axe.
why you little-- get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!
well... it might be cold outside.
oh, i see. it's reverse psychology. well in that case i'm not going and i'm not staying. and i'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling.
song's over, dad.
marge, my fringes are knotted again.
ten percent lycra.
ooo, i think he's a keeper.
that's right.
yeah, what's the deal, loser?
son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--
sold. see ya!
son, let this be a lesson: never work hard and don't form emotional attachments. also, don't be a cow.
bart's in trouble and we don't need your stupid comments!
hmm... that sounds like tress macneille.
we're not here for the game. the game is nothing. the game is crap. the game makes me sick! the real reason we americans put up with sports, is for this...
the food is all around us.
can i be smithers?
why, 'cause i'm fat?
what, i'm going for a shia labeouf thing. not quite a nerd, not quite a hunk... shia labeouf!
uh-oh. there's already an on-set romance.
maybe i can finally meet jim jarmusch and ask him who he is. hey, that's him! who are you?
what else?
prove it, hollywood! hey, you're crying!
what?
one, two, three... another chute?! why... doesn't... life... give me... ladders?!
you stupid kid! what if i walked in here barefoot?
quirky? quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! you made us look like monsters!
don't you dare post that review.
no.
i never wanted to be famous for being mean. i wanted to be famous for catching santa claus.
i know! kinda miss it.
sit on a bench! sit on a bench!
what did you say?
it's a medical condition!
who told you these things about me?!
i don't want to get mad, but i will!
it didn't have to go down like this!
don't worry -- i'm ready for this. bart, fetch "the defender."
that's where the food sleeps! wait a minute, i smell apples... cinnamon... crust... it's a pie! why would a robber make pie?
you're right, boy! mom!
i'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream! mom, i can't believe you're here. you keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. you're just like that show "scrubs".
no thanks.
every time you go, i feel abandoned. but not this time. i'm not gonna let myself get hurt.
that's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. in fact, i don't even want your pie.
oh, i don't even care.
i'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
no! i can't forgive you -- and i don't accept your tuck-in!
i feel terrible. my own mother reached out to me, and i rejected her. i'm gonna make her a card. mom? are you asleep? asleep with your eyes open? mom? mom!
i'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.
she said i didn't suck?
that bad. wow.
i just wish she hadn't died thinking i hated her.
that's it.
a donut from the future!
woo hoo!
aw, ma. you always knew just how to make everything all right. it works on so many levels.
why you little...
i always knew that at the end, it would all come down to me.
to spare, eh?
wait a minute... mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. mom! you used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?
i don't think so.
you can have her. to me, she's been nothing but trouble.
just what are you guys up to?
the rainforest?! that's that thing lisa likes!
mom, i'm so sorry. you just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. well, if i get out of this i promise you i'll grant your last wish.
toss it down! thanks, boy.
god bless america!
that'll do, brick, that'll do.
well then, mom, this was for you.
pee?!
bart's having girl trouble. you better go talk to him.
i thought i was in charge of bedtime stories and pets dying.
uh, we'll stick with the coins.
son... all hobbies suck. but if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time.
do you wanna collect coins with your old man?
to your mother's purse!
the one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. son, we are getting that coin!
wait! this is a classic nineteen seventy-eight pizza hut! mmm... terrible.
son, coin collecting's a lot like life. it stopped being fun a long time ago. but unlike life, i have a solution for this.
okay boy, this is it. five dollars!
five hundred and one!
objection, your honor.
mr. burns, my son and i have been collecting coins. it's really brought us closer together. that penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him.
yeah. i'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. do you have change for a nickel?
i'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
three-peat.
i make that in a year.
and if i don't show up?
stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
flanders!
this case is "in the bag."
i sure could've, thanks to you.
it's your share of the money for bringing in that bail jumper. ned, i never thought i'd say this, but we make a great team.
sure. what is it?
and you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
just warming it up. now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
let's roll.
no, it looks cool!
point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.
something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. a new chemistry set.
evidence that i love my little girl. marge, i brought you some flowers! a full dozen this time! no tricks!
yes, for now. i guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. maybe we could order one of your cakes for lisa's birthday.
what'd you do that for?
i'm not convinced. still on the fence. now i believe you.
done for free
oh, you've gotta try it. this way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. then, bam!
you've got to roll it from the point. here, let me show you.
now let it unfurl in your stomach.
hey, it worked, didn't it? okay smart guy, you're going in the bag.
you know what your problem is? you haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
i'll tell you what's over! this partnership!
i can't take another word out of you!
marge, i can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. but withholding sexy cake? i know we have to move past this, but i don't see how.
first, why don't you and i and the cake take a shower?
what have you done to my family?
and how did you know i wouldn't be there?
you hang onto resentment like a confederate widow.
yeah, but you hold onto the big things! the point is, the more i got to know you, the more i got to like you.
so, it's gonna be like that, eh? i've got you, my friend.
well, i'm-- phew. now all we have to do is get out before the concrete hardens. aw, dammit!
oh, baby. thanks, marge.
huh? this counts as a parent-teacher conference!
did he take the bait?
hey, he went into a construction site!
no problem.
eh, he won't get far. not on the crappy breakfast i made for him.
our little boy has lost his mind. let's get him.
bart! where are you, boy?! don't worry, i won't strangle you.
is that him? no, it's just a bush. clearly the work of wirakocha, the trickster god.
the computer says bart's standing on the computer. all i see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! it doesn't add up!
oh, uh, she's uh...
you better settle down, boy, or i'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera... ...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!
you just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!
i was gonna bet it on the dogs!
that kid has become a dennis-level menace!
bart cost us fifty thousand dollars.
oh, you look great.
well marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant...
stop it, both of you! don't make me drive into that tree! you know i will!
lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals...
human garbage can to the rescue! so at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs.
talk louder? you bet. naturally, i threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. but then lenny said "no, that was the new chair. that memo was two months old!" so now i'm sitting on an orange crate. i never felt so--
huh?
that's it, boy! you're going to bed without supper!
for your information, the "daily growl" is the only newspaper that's not afraid to say how great this country is! how's the war going? we're winning, that's great! and our standing abroad? fantastic!
thank you, future bart, for traveling back through time to warn us!
this looks like a job for captain crazy! up, up and away! aw come on, gravity. you used to be cool! occupied!
no.
nobody shuts out my blather!
were we ever that stupid?
c'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it.
marge! i love this guy!
i wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.
marge bouvier, will you not marry me?
then i now pronounce us "just dating." i love kissing you. i never want to knock it off.
videogames -- the reason this generation of americans is the best ever.
that's it! eat gravel, hags!
uh-oh.
i know -- i was hoping the number might be zero.
a really fun party? full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? doesn't seem like your kind of thing, marge.
no, get two of your own.
no, i'm trying to get me drunk.
well, a horoscope would never lie to a pretty girl like you.
no, i'm talking to you, at this great party!
she's not strange! she's fun! and she doesn't get jealous when i talk to other women!
sushi fight!! these fish died for nothing!
what a cute couple. she's gonna take him for a lot of money.
kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me.
i'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.
why flanders, you rogue. all marge and i need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized "do not disturb" sign.
what?! but i have urges!
he's not talking, he's yelling!
do you have a pineapple pizza?!
this is all going so fast.
i came here once with marge. are you marge, sylvia?
i want you to be marge. marge?! marge? is that you?
you better not be! i mean, great! we both came to rekindle our precious memories of when we were young and in love. right?
oh, oh, oh, i have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here.
i feel the same way about that lamp.
okay.
coming, marge!
that takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside boggle?
hmm, all right. the trick is to ease them off--
i wish i'd never met you!
yeah. i missed her like five times.
forever? that would be awesome.
and i suppose you and maude will be coming along as well?
saving our marriage!
i don't want to let go of our special carving!
marge, i don't want to die with us mad at each other.
i know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, american history...
but we're married.
how about r?
woo-hoo! adult situations!
lemonade! six cups, please. and put it on my tab. keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only. fine, lemonade's for babies anyway! i'm going to moe's, for beer! have fun drinking your lemonade, babies! lisa, can daddy borrow your bike?
no, this is about you. edna wants to break up.
yeah.
yeah. look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. you have all your hair... unlike me. no kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... oh, god, i hate my life!
exactly. you're good looking, have a decent job... what lonely widow wouldn't consider you an option?
and you will again. because he isn't really dead. and now this next piece of news won't seem so bad...
the gay guy?
you'll always have a special place in his heart!
anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone? okay, everyone. rotate one to your right.
marge, i'm getting' out of the break-up business and i don't know if i'll ever sleep soundly again.
surely some holds are barred.
well, it sounds really exciting and you're a delightful young lady. now if you'll excuse me...
really? well, i did bring this envelope full of money. and these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment.
what is it?
she won! and like any prudent gambler, i know when to walk away: never!
and when you win, i win. i'll explain that to you on your deathbed.
you what?
just be yourself. i wanna change my bet... i'm going against my daughter.
fine. i won't look you in the eye. have i made the bet yet?
you know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental.
no.
well, sweetie, daddy made a little extra money betting against you in the crossword tournament. you'll understand when you're a parent placing large wagers against your own children. i hope you're not mad.
you sure you're not mad?
nooooooooooooooooo!
yessssssssssssssss!
well, i had a little help from this guy.
dear lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. sorry, he told me i needed a hundred and forty-four letters. what was my point again? oh right. bouvier or simpson, i cherish you.
kitten calendar.
what does it do?
but it's glowing.
disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... salaam alaikum!
sir? that's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an american kid.
hey, bashir's great. if derek jeter married mariah carey, it wouldn't last, but i bet they'd have a kid like him.
oh, i can't believe that till i see a fictional tv program espousing your point of view.
oh my god. what can i do?
here's the plan, marge. you keep 'em talking. i'll be listening... and quietly judging.
why don't i get us dessert? i made us a little cake. care to cut? watch this, lenny.
what's the matter? don't like the taste of freedom?
shut up, old man.
that's it! ruin a perfect evening!
okay, i'll apologize. up-bup-bup! don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison.
all right, sweetie. but if i wake up tomorrow we'll discuss it.
now do flanders!
nooooooo! hm. usually that ends the dream. the power of dreaming has convinced me the threat is real!
i want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. and i thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.
wait, wait, wait, wait... i read somewhere your people are hospitable to guests. is that true?
praise be oliver.
we'll look it up in the corona.
u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
what about the bridge?
did we really need a bridge there?
i'll save you!
duh!
what?!
bo-ring!
flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.
worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!
animals can get sick?!
you're the nerd.
and mine was snakes and yours was...
the secret is not to swallow the stingers.
they're just drones, lisa. they only live for like five minutes anyway. and they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and bart.
which used to be a beautiful, thriving greenhouse 'til i was hired to run it.
i knew it!
huh? but how are we supposed to combine the dna of two strains of the same species?
you and me?
oh yeah, yeah, that's what i meant too. i have no... inclination...
yep. and she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
hm, i'm not sure. let me check. are you guys dangerous? a simple "yes" would've sufficed.
when you're older, you'll miss these fun activities.
uh, 'cause no one's making me. buh-bye.
could've been. if we hadn't had kids.
friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it.
okay, honey. if it's that important to you, you said it.
use as many big words as possible. i call "computer." bart, you can have "doorbell."
hey! that was--
if you say so, m'lord.
if you'll show me to your bathroom, i'd like to pretend to wash my hands.
hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?
oh, i get it. here's ten bucks.
well, that's bart for ya.
seems like you and i are always talking about bart, my son.
oh, that. we were actually just going out for brunch and i got lost. but don't worry, officer. we'll definitely have a talk with the boy.
i doubt it -- friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.
is it a place i'd look overdressed if i did wear a tie?
what about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?
and you know what else, sweetie? you and your friend princess nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad. okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard.
no, he's ten days younger.
sunday's the lord's day, boy. not god's. completely different guy.
if i had won class president, i'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now.
yup -- back in high school, right before i met your mother. a simpler time when the only thing we worried about was total nuclear annihilation...
guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
exception that proves the rule. if losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. watch, i'll prove it. angry nut coming through.
hey, vance?
great, thanks. listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?
please! you've gotta have some secret agony! i bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.
i'll just stick with my beer.
because when vance beat me in that election, he ruined my life. why did you just exchange that look of guilt?
al gore?
that's not why i'm here. get dressed.
the ballot box?!
what will this box reveal? and what will i use this box for afterwards? mismatched nuts and bolts? recipes? i may never know.
woo-hoo!
woo-hoo!
, or woo hoo?
yes! i'm senior class president! i get a parking spot if the assistant principal isn't using it! wait a second. if i'd been class president like i was supposed to, i'd be the one with the big mansion and the color tvs and the hot wife!
marge, i still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter.
that's exactly what it means. and dondelinger took that life away from me. and the taking of a life is murder. and the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but i'm gonna find dondelinger and tell him i know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!
dondelinger! i should have been class president, but you stole the election from me.
yes! i want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame.
i respect your choice. now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a tom collins.
virgin? what are you, a girl? now, dondelinger, i want some answers.
huh? who said that?
okay.
i would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. why did fate do this to me?
why? why?
...debbie pinson. hey, debbie, um... wanna go to prom with me?
debbie, i forgot i have an english paper due on monday. would you read "to kill a mockingbird" for me and if you could write down how boo radley fits into the southern gothic tradition, that would be great.
homer simpson. class president.
a lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. may i have this dance?
i do! oh, right.
marge, the way i feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline.
sweet dreams.
thank you, mysterious weirdo.
uh, yes. that must be it. this is the best of all possible worlds. blah, blah, blah.
okay.
oh, i get it. you're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right? are you kidding? we couldn't even convince you that bruce wayne is batman. oh, come on! that millionaire playboy? he's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the wayne foundation.
oh, look who thinks he's smarter than sauce.
i guess that would be nice.
really? sure.
thanks, guys. hey, was there another plaque here before?
now let's get something to eat.
ooh, that sounds like fun!
you're the government's problem now!
who taught you that language?!
so you did learn something.
oh no! now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp? great jokes make me hungry. i wonder what's in the pantry...
must be in the glove box.
marge, i won't bore you with the truth. all i can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house.
fine. back. and we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
book club? that's the most stupid boring thing ever. oh, thank you.
oh yeah. i mean, nooo!
kniiiife! got it!
oh, mr. burns! why do terrible things always happen to wonderful people at three-oh-one p.m., which, for the record, is the correct time. so, plans for the weekend?
i know they do, but the simpson mardi gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. and we spare no expense.
this counts as that. ladies, how're you doing with the float?
no problem.
ha, ha! eat my food! drink up my drink! put your coat on my daughter's bed! i command you!
because i have this magical thing called a home equity loan. i borrow all the money i want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. sucker.
fine, mr. skeptical. give me back your beads.
beads, please.
marge, don't worry. it's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. they stopped calling us. in fact, everyone did!
listen, you! when you gave me that money, you said i wouldn't have to repay it till the future! this isn't the future! it's the lousy, stinking now!
that poor man. is he okay?
don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. i ripped all the copper wire out of the walls.
did i what now?
let's go, kids. i can't watch any more.
and on the zillionth day, god created hugs. and it was gooood.
uh, uh, uh, uh, better let me go first. i left a little uh "surprise" upstairs for the new owner.
he saved our ass!
it's so beautiful. no two are exactly alike. though many of them are very similar.
he what?! flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! you lounge around in your egg macmansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!
some friend you are. the minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. you'd better just pray i don't find out where you live! bart! don't forget to turn the chicken!
yeah, you'd treat her right.
who is this "dad" you speak of, lisa simpson?
yes.
why you little... i'm the victim here!
kadiddlehopper.
fine. i'll get another neighbor to buy the house and let us live in it!
flanders, you wouldn't throw us out on christmas, would you?
it is me, jesus! i have come from my workshop in the north pole to say: don't evict the simpsons!
it was... um... do you have a computer nearby?
don't worry, marge. according to this chapter book, we have a secret weapon: "evictee will be granted a stay of eviction if said household includes a resident aged sixty-five or over." finally, a practical use for my father.
i'm using you!
my own devices!
well, i guess we can take a quick walk. we'll keep grampa occupied with this dvd of dwight eisenhower talking about golf.
well, i can't compete with that!
honey, don't cry. it could be worse -- at least it's not raining! see, i told you, it's not raining. so we're just homeless.
that's not true. you have bug bites you can scratch.
oh, flanders, i promise i'll never abuse our friendship again.
no, i'm gonna see it first!
my space toy!
we'll be talking about this together for years!
i finally feel like part of a family!
you just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
great time to nap, einstein!
catholics!
come on, lady, have a heart. i screwed up! i'm sure your husband does stupid things sometimes!
oh no, oh no, ohhh no. there is no way homer simpson's gonna put on a dress and act like a nun.
um... no problem, sweetie.
cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
you told me something, but i wasn't listening!
fair enough! kids, let's practice. mi-mi-mi-miiiii!
that was good, but lisa, you're still complaining from your throat, not your diaphragm.
maybe it's beef stew! hot tubs! guys, what's it like?
please, can i get it, marge? please? please?
beats me. / i'unno. / please, please, please!
interesting proposal. now with an opposing point of view: bubbles.
hey, flanders! why don't you join us? afraid you'll get your moustache wet?
oh dad, i never knew you had dreams, or emotions.
whoa, whoa, whoa, who said anything about a jar?
okay... "pitch in the negro leagues," i can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it... have one more beer at o'flanagan's pub... we'll do that one!
lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!
gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!
you okay, dad?
oh, i miss her.
well, dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an irishman?
who are you, stuttering fonzie? what about you, bicycle pants?
why you... uh-oh. our first sale! our first refund.
yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! there's sully, and mack, jimmy d. and jimmy b.! what can i get ya, boys -- the usual? we are so screwed!
well, we need help. someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm.
people can't smoke indoors in ireland!
well, "da," it looks like all your "der" have come "ter."
i can't tell if those are questions or statements.
don't worry, dad. we'll get out. america is the new york yankees of countries -- powerful and respected until the year two thousand.
oh my god, she fainted! let's go get smelling salts! suckers!
you don't get it, padre. my old lady and i have a thing goin' on. we don't need a piece of paper to keep it real.
i need that paper quick!
why you little bastard...
hello. it's me, lance romance. your first mission is to look out the window.
marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. so -- will you marry me -- in style?
did you hear that, santa? she said yes! yes! now, back to your cold, airless tomb.
how'd you check?!
chocolate.
what if we...
but there is, marge! the first two letters...
why not?
but i have to marry marge!
just so you know, you're making a pretty bad first impression.
you idiot! how am i ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is! to get the key i have to lick through a lollipop? oh, how awful. what the?
whose side are you on?
thank you, that's very... more sarcasm. just see that my fiancée marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
i'm not sure what happened. i was kidnapped, then tortured, then i fell into a surprisingly sound sleep. when i awoke, i felt refreshed. then i was blindfolded, and two sobbing trolls threw me out of a van onto our lawn.
won't it dry up in a few days and fall off in the bath?
i'm sorry, honey. i wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding.
i love to see this!
stop him, babando!
i will, when it's not sports season. i just want to know how the game ends.
wha-wha-what's the score?!
oh, marge. this is a definite high point for our marriage.
yes?
that's ridiculous. who's your daddy, maggie? who's your daddy? he is pretty good with her.
marge, you're not naggy. you just set the bar impossibly high.
hey, maggie could play out there... while i watch her from in here. whaddaya say, maggie? aw, her first enabling.
hello maggie... hello maggie.
i can too! "there once was this guy from an island off the coast of massachusetts... uh, nantucket, i think it was. anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh...
there you are! aww. innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. how sweet. maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
i have not! oh right, you think i do.
pleased to meet you. uh, perhaps this is inappropriate, but i have a mechanical question while the kids are out of the room, that i can't help wondering about. in a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?
man oh man, slap a ring on that!
here we are, maggie. that park you love... see you when the moon comes out.
and i'm good at beginnings.
not a thing in the world.
moe, this was a great thing for you. you went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. and sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. and that means someone can love you again. and that'll make you smile.
boy.
oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name.
marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. that's the most a parent can do. we done here?
yeah, busboys get all the chicks.
son, girls come and go. but you'll always have your family.
oh, this is great, honey. thanks for telling me about it. i hope you don't mind i invited lenny.
water!
is it 'omplimentawee?
it is? 'ey every-ody, 'eck out i 'ompliment!
well, at least i can eat again! mmm, cherry. too much cherry! ooh, lemon. that'll stop the cherry. doctor, why is this happening to me?
i can't eat tacos?! oh my god -- what day of mayo is it?
ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
i still taste over-tones of pink!
what else do they got?
man, who comes up with this stuff?
don't have one.
son, from now on, i'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!
uh... can i work it off? don't worry, i won't embarrass you.
oh, i'm big and yellow / and i'm servin' jell-o / if you're a fellow and you want some jell-o / you'd better bellow / hey, big guy / gimme some jell-o up-bup-bup. no jell-o for you, bart -- it'll keep you up at night. like last week when you crawled into bed with me and mommy?
buddy, i'm here to eat, not make interesting conversation.
well, i know when i'm not wanted. am i wanted?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?
well i hope your son enjoys being driven around by the president of the united states.
i don't have to "helicopter" bart -- i've got a backup plan called "lisa."
no time. i'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head. that makes sense. movin' on. ...if we don't get more involved in their lives, bart and lisa are gonna be failures. failures who work for... noah!
if marge doesn't worry about the kids... then that leaves... me! help me, mayonnaise!
there's no future in that!
a thousand dollars?! that's what my house is worth!
i did it! i helped my son! helicopter homer away! black hawk down! black hawk down!
and to show you how this book works, i will demonstrate on some rats...
see, it works. and un-sults are just the beginning. there's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?
ooo, i'm sorry, moe. i didn't mean everyone everyone. hope you don't mind.
and that, my dear girl, is called the toledo take-back.
enough to build a washington monument.
what cologne are you wearing? none of your business! now we'd like our washington monument to be one five-hundredth the size of the real one.
what do you mean? and who are you?
but, you... what's the hardest model there is?
hey, how hard can it be? all we have to do is follow the directions.
but first, as part of "operation popularity," lisa and i are hosting a decorate-your-own-cell-phone party in the back yard. brittany and kaitlin are here! where's my spray-on tan? ant poison? why do i always read the labels after? ladies, we've got it all. rhinestones, stickers, tassels... everything to make those hundred dollar phones look like five dollar toys.
all the other parents are doing it for their kids. now stand back and i'll take it from here. a little further back.
naw, that kinda creeps me out. must finish poet's corner... or bart will work for noah... with his hot mom...
anne of cleves!
oscar wilde?
but that makes no sense!
shut up!
yes! yes! in your face, losers! this helicopter is taking off!
i'm sorry. i got carried away. from now on the only thing i'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. but at least i made lisa popular. i h-8 this?
yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing i can do as a parent is simply check out.
lisa, a light bulb is either on or it's off.
i tried to fix the kids' lives, but instead i led them to rich and rewarding personal decisions of their own.
that mattress the dog sleeps on in the cellar?
it was stuffed with cash!
oh yeah.
oh, elementary school friends -- those are forever! you're always gonna be friends with milhouse. stand by me / oh, stand by me...
ahso sheepay to you.
yeah, um, well, i'm looking at a lot of murder sites right now. where's the bedroom?
tempting. tempting. where's the bathroom?
ha! i can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. how i despise them.
heads. i mean, tails. i mean, on its side.
that's not enough. thank you.
when do i get to move back home?
that's another twenty or thirty years.
that was great. you mind if i use that at work?
well, i love to play, but i'm not very good. also, i always forget to cash my chips back in for money.
you make words into dudes.
two, actually. twins.
woo-hoo! we're not the only ones having a good time.
how 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?
try the flan de leche de cabra... be sure to dig around in the gunk.
where are my videogames? my x-box?! my wii?!
you know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife.
i went to a movie.
i drove.
thank you, friendo.
but, i thought... you said...
why do you watch comedies if you don't want to hear more jokes?
what do you think, marge? maybe we've outgrown our first apartment.
be cool or you're grounded!
thanks, marge. but don't forget, there's still gonna be a civil suit.
well, i may be playing a tree but at least i'm getting my face out there.
hey, there's no way i could ever be as good as that guy.
whatever you say, sweetie.
a prop knife!
well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks.
conrad birdie? coming here to sweet apple?!
who the hell is banquo?
wouldn't it be easier if i just took acting lessons?
that's inspiring. what's that from? x-men 2?
mac-who?
no, dear. i'm a man, dear. killing makes me hun-gry eating makes me thirs-ty drinking makes me slee-py
ow!
it's my moment.
me having to read all those plays would be the real tragedy.
great! do you want to see me naked?
great. okay. marge, go.
you? awesome. next.
eh, they can go to hell. bart?
fine. i'll give back the oscars i stole from the lobby. do you want the golden globe?
i don't know if i can. i'm a yo-yo dieter: "yo, hot dog man!" "yo, peanuts!" why aren't you laughing? don't you know what "yo" means?
finally, the answer to my problem. what do you do?
hm, they look good with a little meat on their bones.
yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate .
oh, that song's a little on the nose. can we do it to david bowie's "heroes?"
this montage sounds really exhausting. how 'bout i just do a walking around sad montage?
a montage of me turning a ragtag little league team into state runners-up?
was that tobey maguire?
found this on the roof.
what'd you think, kids?
your other hand.
a lot of things come and go in life. but not fame and fitness.
is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
but you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
he's gone. one cheese cube couldn't hurt. oh. this other cheese cube's stuck to the first one. well, that still technically counts as one. it's bad luck to eat an even number of cheese cubes. don't look at me. don't look at me! you. you watch.
marge, speak to me.
nag, nag, nag.
uh-oh.
i'm right here! i've been here all along!
i knew it!
just you and me?
that could work.
you just said both those things to me.
it will be his last birthday if he keeps drawing pictures like this.
i said, are there any areas that we, his parents, can improve upon?
you're the first teacher that ever got me.
no... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
great. go nuts. but remember, we never had this discussion.
the one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! ohhh.
not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly.
maybe.
ah yes, filthy, but obscure. with a subtle scatological undertone.
pay the man, boy. now listen, son, i know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. do it at the schoolyard. someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass joe biden.
kill! kill. kill.
ultimate punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. studies have shown your mother is right.
i couldn't help it! she knew my one weakness -- that i'm weak!
five, six / who's got tix?
yeah, marge. he'll knock your block off. your beautiful block.
listen: of all the crazy things i've ever done, this is the craziest. and you're doing it.
how can i control her?! i have nothing to withhold!
we've gotta get marge some professional training. carl, do you know heavyweight champ drederick tatum?
well, i... uh...
there certainly is. marge simpson reporting for duty!
well, you'd better not leave me and talk to your old friends all night.
woo hoo!
ooo, ooo, can i go, marge? can i? can i?
no holds barred.
well, we're not going out to help him. we have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!
how do i know you're not a muncher?
i can't make sense of that muncher talk!
really?
you mean tell her i love her? or i meaning you?
to the panic room store!
another politician who can't keep his promises.
well, this day can't get any crazier.
i think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?
ooo, mouth.
woo hoo! an unattended tap! like takin' beer from a baby!
helllp me!
while turning gay the other day / a thought occurred to me... i'd like to try most every guy / from here to timbuk-tee oh, there's so many men around the world, of every shape and size / i want to nibble on jamaican jerks and teriyaki thighs... i want to french kiss a frenchman, and spoon an english duke / 'cause frankly, dear, to not be queer, just makes me want to puke... so find yourself a man who'll want you in the sack i recommend / our dear old friend / bartender moe szyslak!
she couldn't possibly do worse!
of course i do, marge. can you still love a man who's half-beer?
to love!
can't we just all supervise ourselves?
woo-hoo! our boss is our best buddy!
yeah! hey carl, why aren't you high-fiving?
you see, he hasn't changed!
oh, well... i didn't know that.
why can't i keep the job i have now, whatever it is? not an option, big fella. either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'! oh fine, i guess i'm at your beck.
nooooooo!
calendar! oh my god! i forgot to move carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty. his astrologist will show up at the same time as his astronomer! this is not good! this is not good!
stupid carl... "update the phone list, homer!" "you put my contact lenses in backwards, homer!" i'm sorry, honey.
leave me alone, you two!
honey, i know it's been a rough couple of weeks. but i booked us a night this saturday, at a very romantic hotel.
ocean view, obstructed.
we're gonna be snore in the morning...
okay. kiss me, baby! kiss me like a frog in a fairytale!
actually, those were carl's shirts.
hey, it's not like i want to go. go, go, go!
french nuclear commissioner etienne ducharme.
but i have to get back to marge.
where i should've been all along... in springfield.
oh i don't think so! you know that woman you've been playing "hide the baguette" with? she's the first lady of france, carla bruni!
now, it's my turn to roll the dice! wanna kiss them for me? classic.
gotta leave early to beat the traffic. now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. for crying out-- i hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon!
i can't take it anymore!
it's daddy's turn! stomp it! crush it! kill it!
what happened?
where's the hooch?
a female that gives birth to alcohol.
well, uh... it's got a rich mash base and a sense of danger. and i detect notes of elderberry, tobacco, oak, no, poison oak... and hints of game.
oh sweetie, i found you! now, who's gonna find us? help!
marge, please. you're embarrassing me in front of the mob.
moonshine in the water? i'll be the judge of that. hmm... hillbilly moonshine -- the little witch is right!
start the ride! again!
back to the horses! back to the horses!
i see. so you're saying "warming" makes it colder. well, aren't you the queen of crazyland? everything's the opposite of everything. la-de-da-de-da! i'm lisa simpson. la-de-da-de-da.
son, i love you kids. but i'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and i ain't comin' out.
girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and i don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause i don't know.
you had me at "five-course," you lost me at "romantic," and you got me back at "dinner."
and it's not over yet.
yeah! we couldn't do both.
hm, people in other countries make love? it's about time.
all right, all right, um, your ankle goes there...
and turn that upside down...
...don't look at that...
more vicodin and eggs, please.
i know you miss him, boy. so let's you and me spend some quality father and son time.
did somebody say "naked bacon?"
yeah. it sounded like naked bacon to me. i don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, tom.
no, you said "naked bacon."
hurry! if we don't get a seat in the splash zone, i've worn my bathing suit under my clothes for nothing!
dad, bathing suit! oops, no bathing suit.
get to the show!
wouldn't you be if you were a saltwater fish in a fresh water aquarium?
it's funny... it's poignant... it actually happened... my father is interesting?! the whole world's upside down! that must mean cathy is funny. nope.
how come grampa never shares those stories with us?
marge, my brain is like a computer, and i file away grampa's stories in a very special place. hmm, while i'm up there...
oh dad, i got you some scotch. one of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get.
stay out of this, dad!
that's it! here's your ring back.
it's a father-son commitment band that i bought and never told you about!
stupid grampa. i try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
oh, great stuff. and the life lesson is?...
hmm... i'm just gonna put "haste makes waste."
isn't that cute? he thinks he's a pack.
a little lower... a little lower...
really? me? you mean it?
i've been waiting for this day for so long. the year is nineteen forty-six. in a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. and that flower is an angry japanese monster named godzilla. how am i doin', dad?
fortunately there was one man who could help: colonel tom parker. the colonel took this monster, cleaned him up and put him onstage under the name "the rolling stones." the first concert was a sellout, with many, many, many people eaten. but those that survived raved about the undeniable harmonies and brutally honest lyrics of what they had just seen.
aw c'mon, marge. there's nothing funnier than a good ol' bonk on the head.
you... can't... do that...
d'oh!
they took away our donuts at work! all i've had are my meals!
i guess these days headhunters can be anything. you nuclear workers have no idea how valuable you are. times have never been better for your industry, now that all the protesters who marched in front of nuclear power plants are dying off from radiation poisonin'.
oh bart, you say that now. but when you're grown up, you'll just think it. now you stay here and i'll get your sister.
man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!
you can't win us back with mere donuts.
that is the most amazing donut i've ever tasted.
and you like tomato...
potato!
tomato!
togasaki-rothman!
don't worry, sweetie. with me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride.
she's not my girlfriend. she's a girl who i married, who used to be my friend.
"today is your lucky day." yeah, pfft!
hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat is just a waste of time--
...que decía que hoy era mi día dichoso. primero no lo creí, pero entonces me caí contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!
i'm almost there... i can see the church steeple in the distance... uh-oh, here comes a train.
tickets, please. hey, where's your ticket? leave me alone! why you little...
no time to pretend we're friends! lotto me! one, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five. i did it! i'm gonna make it!
i'll try.
oh yeah. marge? what are you doing?
here i am a millionaire, and i can't even help the woman who gave birth to me.
oh barney, that's brilliant! just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree.
why you little...
a box? no way! a new washing machine? no way!
you go rent us a truck.
why... i'm just...
son, if i was interested in fun, i would've run away the day you were born.
you're right. i have been acting like telethon jerry lewis when i should've been acting like rest-of-the-year jerry lewis. will you teach me how to put myself first?
um... your cut of what?
here. wait!
i said someone like me, i didn't say me.
look at me! i'm flying, like superman's dog! race you to the cockpit!
sorry boy. you have school tomorrow.
with that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings! boy, i am through spoiling you. first thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed.
i agreed to no such thing!
where and what time?
never!
what do i wear?
not if i tell her first.
okay, i'm taking off the blindfold...
marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, i have something to confess. um... i wasn't there for that wedding toast because... i was buying a lottery ticket.
you have a right to be angry. furious! and even though that ticket won a million dollars and--
yes, but i have one more thing to show you.
marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am i off the hook?
and you like potato...
and you like tomato...
uh, mr. burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? it's date night.
i'm sorry i missed dinner, honey. we still have time to catch a movie. that can be romantic.
it'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie. we're outta here.
dude...
would you like to wear mittens or go commando?
what, they come here on saturday night to clean the ice? losers.
marge, this is perfect for both of us! it's got bowling for me and sweeping for you!
curling is real.
great curling reference.
there's a winter olympics?
olympic trials, eh?
she used to be my therapist.
i couldn't hear the last thing you said! goodbye forever!
oh, a pork bao, a shrimp bao, everywhere a bao bao / homer simpson wins a gold / sliding rocks on ice... bao bao!
oh my god, i'm holding back the team. but our marriage is based on curling. what am i gonna do?
that's my marge! high-five!
ooo, you're mad when you're angry... marge, you're really good with your left hand.
but this time, on ice!
u.s.a.! u.s.a.! oops.
listen, lisa. you're gonna find more than you bargained for. if i were you, i wouldn't dig into the past. i lived in some of that past, and i got out for a reason.
i warn you: i don't know what's in there but if it's about a simpson, you ain't gonna be proud.
me neither. for once, the simpsons were in management!
good point, bart.
well i don't. the motto of the simpsons is, "quit while you're ahead."
time for bed, sweetie.
i got an idea: you can march to selma -- and tell her she's ugly!
the library? bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?
listen, wrinkles! if you know something that'll cheer up my little girl, you'd better spill it. or i can make things very uncomfortable for you.
about virgil.
and that's why i earn less than my white co-workers!
so that's why i love drinking so much.
a little!
i say this boy needs more homework. i don't have to do it with him, do i? pile it on! i want him to be korean by the time he's done.
no problem. you can unload.
oh my! a child who doesn't enjoy school? hello? hollywood?! you want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? a million dollars? deal! now i have to write it.
too late, marge. i already used a "prayer block" on your prayer.
yeah, right.
you don't get to relax till you get to the bottom of this homework stack.
well don't be wrong in front of our son!
what the?! then i wanna eat at moe's express!
that was last week, and you're still bringing it up!
well how could i ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
fine. i was gonna apologize, but now i'm not going to!
no freedom! i have no freedom around this house! after sex, i'm not talking to you!
you can't sex fire me, i sex quit!
we can't let bart drive us apart. he's the reason we had to get married.
bart? bart who? i'm being cute.
you may not realize this, bart, but your mother and i have been fighting about you a lot lately. and i've realized our marriage is more important than your future. from now on, you're on your own.
uh, marge? i don't want to ruin the moment, but you got something stuck between your-- ohhh...
yeah.
don't know, don't care.
sorry!
but marge, i thought we were chilling out for the sake of our marriage.
fine. i'll do both at once. we should both take a role in vacation planning!
and no tv!
meters?
stupid kid. thinks he's smarter than a computer. seatbelts, kids!
why you...
hey boy.
that's all that happened? and i got to miss work? i could kiss you.
well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
you're halfway home, lady.
no! if you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever.
and the glasses smell like the last guy who wore them had pizza!
i finally caught one of bart's school plays.
yeah, now that i look closer, that guy couldn't fool anybody.
why you little...
hold that thought.
here comes the butt!
hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do i sign up?
i can't! latkes aren't as good as american pancakes. they're okay with applesauce.
flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. but the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!
after we see the stations of the omelet bar.
he's going for the record! he's going for the record! flanders, you're not supposed to help him.
ned, i'm an american tourist. i'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my carolina panthers credit card. pan-thers!
please, please, please...
that is going right on stupidflanders.org.
boy, are you lousy at reading minds. okay, okay. for you, i'll try.
i'm not, it's my ringtone. y'ello. this is he. yeah i wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of mount zion? great. i'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. yes, i know what a falafel is.
why you little... give my dad another heart attack?!
whuh?
i'm sorry. it's just that these tours are so exhausting. you're jetlagged, you're walking around all day... it's so hard to sleep knowing marge and the kids are all stuck in one small room.... and it's so nice and cool in the tomb of the unknown savior...
porky pig?
whatever. it's your camera.
your parents made you?
what? but i thought we'd be neighbors in heaven. goofing on all the new dead people...
chosen for what, oh mighty gherkin?
i am more than alive, woman! i am the chosen one who shall unite all the faiths of the holy land! i am... the messiah!
oh yeah. gotta keep track of those. the messiah! has the passports.
i'm more than okay! i am the messiah, come to save the world! look upon me and shudder!
as you wish, but look not upon her with lust. and do not send her friendly emails. that's how it begins.
attention christians, muslims, and jews. i have come to gather you into a new faith. from now on you shall be called chrismujews.
celebrate your commonality. some of us don't eat pork. some of us don't eat shellfish. but all of us love chicken!
spread the word! peace and chicken!
well, if i made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in. can i buy you a twelve dollar turkey sandwich?
they have malls on land?
woo hoo!
i say burns owes us a party. let's have one, right now, with his wine!
i'm pounding melchizedeks!
yeah, you're right. the government. taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.
uh... this is my lunch.
but--
eat my lunch?
you don't think i'm going to?
okay.
there's always a catch.
patty and selma are dead? woo hoo! a double funeral!
uh listen... can i leave a little early tomorrow? my kid has a thing.
smithers. what a marshmallow. i don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!
i do, but i'm not going to it.
ooh! we mock your very decency.
i never thought i'd say this, but i wish mr. burns was back.
the war is over and the future won. the past never had a chance, man!
community service? but... that's work! what about jail?
no! i wanna go to jail! free food! teardrop tattoos! library books that come to youuu! i'll serve anything but the communityyy!
awwww, want a bite?
from fast food to fine dining?
oh yeah. all the time. they say it's 'cause i'm overweight.
that's some big underwear.
oh yeah -- sorry i was such a jerk about it.
i'm there every day, five to eleven.
aw dang! i lost track of time! i'm gonna be late for work.
wow. so this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
impressive. hey, would it be okay if i uh... "ran a make" on myself?
drunk and disorderly? that's a little redundant. hey, uh, mind if i do a little "spring cleaning?"
really? me?
chief... me too.
hey, ralph's a good kid. and he should be, he's got a great dad.
you saved my life. and i came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
clancy, i haven't seen my family in days. would you mind if i went home now?
well, if you really want me to stay...
playing nursemaid to chief wiggum.
okay, maybe i lied. but you've been so needy... "i'm hungry," "i'm itchy," "that's not my blood type..."
hey man, you planted that!
everything.
well, i was kind of ungrateful. you did save my life.
we're not gonna get whacked. because you're chief clancy wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this.
no, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. your awesomeness is real.
i know just the guy.
look at this electric bill! i'm not made of money! i'm made of man-meat and a skeleton! it's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. lamp, computer, jacob's ladder... how long has this been running?
are you calling me fat?
hmm... alternative energy expo. where there's expos, there's free frisbees! let's roll. but we'd better make sure robbers don't know we're out.
yeah, so is getting a real job.
well, i'm not usually one to take the word of a dane... plus, how can i afford it?
months?
hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal.
i'm starting to regret it already.
oh my goodness! it means we're traveling back in time! i can warn president lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!
oh, that's just great. i discover electricity and they want to take it from me! hello, local utility? you greedy bastards have gouged homer simpson for the last time.
the simpsons are off the grid! and so far it's going great! gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. the kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!
don't worry, i'll go see what's wrong! what the? who turned off the wind?
the wind may have stopped working, but my brain nev...er does. check it out, gang.
but we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting! you used to be nicer!
now we're cookin' with wind!
nothing is ever right for you.
we'll have to eat thanksgiving dinner off regular plates like animals!
all right -- let me get my tool belt. man, who are these belts made for, french supermodels?
sure. lisa, bring the car around.
haven't you learned anything from watching bart drive?
that whale's not gonna die! we're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, escobar! god, this thing writes itself. coming!
one, two, three, tug!
it was my idea to put the whale in the water.
oh lisa, i'm sorry. i tried my best. i know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect.
of course. it kills me to see her like that. and if there's one thing i can't stand it's being killed.
nature is a toothless dying hag! we are gonna save those whale babies!
i'm taking it on a test drive from the boat store! get in!
oh come on! leave me alone! i'm trying to save your precious whales!
typical eco-jerks -- using words to talk!
sharks, innocent? please. every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. the shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder...
ooh, a baby whale. my diet is working.
thanks, buddy!
absolutely. he's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. they'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. but if i'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way.
i want some of that!
keep guessing... what's it say, boy?
mmmm. good mac and cheese.
i am pretty full.
i'm on my way!
golf ball-sized hail!
woo-hoo!
hey boy, whatcha doing?
my little einstein.
well, uh... the one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so i'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?
remember how you wanted me to get that expensive operation? well, now i can afford a motorcycle!
later. later.
you see, ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil.
god created the devil? finally, he did something cool.
well, if you ask me, you were trying to play god.
moe's leaving town?!
i like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach.
cleaning the gutters?
cartoons! everybody be quiet! so, marge, what were we talking about?
son, i'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and i can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything.
i hear what you're saying, lisa -- nothing.
i got marge!
marge! are you running off with moe?!
aw dammit!
can't talk! must text! marge, have u left me 4...
moe, my in-laws are coming. i need something strong enough that i forget i hate them, but not so strong that i tell them i love them.
marge, this is crazy!
all right.
what the--
why you--
lousy--
i'm doomed.
uh... i do.
i was there when your wife got to moe's, being my usual effervescent self...
i don't know.
the ferry will be back in ten minutes. it'll take us home... to find out the truth.
today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous.
she's packing her bag!
thirty-nine.
oh marge, you not leaving with moe is the best thing that never happened to me.
moe, i don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so i'm gonna do both.
why should i? the city's broke! they can't afford to enforce their precious laws!
cookies... so delicious... must buy house.
but my loan has already been sold in pieces to banks, hedge funds, and municipalities across the globe!
or frasier on "frasier."
stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette.
marge, the bathroom scale is lying again.
and i'm not a locksmith! man, that dude does not like bart.
mexico! andalé! andalé! arriba!
help us! help us, for the love of god! won't somebody help us?!
uh yes, i'd like... um... how do you say taco in mexican?
oh, yeah, yeah, right. uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it.
stop! stop! stop!
hmmmm. not ugly enough. i want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.
oh my god. you never fail to nauseate me, boy.
but if we win this, we get a gift certificate.
it doesn't matter.
oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--
yeah. now what am i supposed to do?
well, since moe's is closed again, i thought i'd help you cook dinner.
what are we watching?
after the title page it's bob dole's memoirs.
i organized the kitchen. i labeled everything with a label maker... and i also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!
well, that place was for diehard sports fans, not guys like me who are only fans when their team makes the playoffs. so, i decided to take apart the washing machine to see where that penny i left in my pants went.
marge! you ruined my shot!
oooh, the nobies!
lucky.
how easy am i?
can my son come too? he knows what to do when i swallow my tongue.
they fight and bite? i never go to europe without learning something.
another good one...
wait! not so fast! we found something to save krusty.
uh, what region is america?
woo hoo! we're region one! we're region one!
no fair! we just went to church!
well, it's a cat -- i'm not sure it's the cat.
you know what, honey? just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town.
after bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made.
oh, you don't want to wait for that buffet -- wiggum's making his move!
i believe this stranger!
check and mate.
wait a minute, marge. don't you realize what just happened? you got to enjoy that bag for nothing! we can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund. hide a sandwich in this hat. "mary poppins" myself to work with this umbrella.
yeah, the luck lasts longer! thanks to the power of returns, this store is our closet!
now, everyone onto the hot tub. come on on, the cardboard's fine.
yes... uh... maybe i'll just come back during someone else's shift... is claire working today? she's a real sucker.
how do you know my name?
it's not what you think... i came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um...
hello, flanders. don't you have a neighbor on the other side?
sorry, marge. the last time i stepped on a baseball field, i got tased.
that's a problem for future homer. man, i don't envy that guy.
hey pal, howya doin'?
i'll put a stop to this nonsense!
sorry marge, i gotta call bullcrap on that. the '69 mets will live on forever, but you think anyone cares about ron swoboda's wife and kids? not me -- and, i assume, not ron swoboda!
boys don't have feelings, they have muscles.
they sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally.
if he makes it, that's my son!
you stink!
yeah, charts are for squares, baby.
that's my cell phone. what is it? lenny, i'm on a second honeymoon. you'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. now, where were we? oh baby. let's give those seagulls something to squawk about.
o-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know...
fine. i'm going for a walk.
hey, i've had a hard trip too. one of the lenses fell out of my sunglasses.
marge, can i have a word with you in private? i don't trust that guy. i bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.
it was poisoned.
well, it was rhubarb.
well, we'd better do it quick. because he's making scones! they should call this one "recipe for murder."
never mind.
yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea. come 'n' get it barnacles!
this proves nothing. roger could've been the one that killed them!
then... his story was true!
hey pal, how ya been?
we had to kill him, or he'd tell people we tried to kill him.
looks like you've got a flair for avoiding death. oh, come on! just a second... bankers away!
marge, what are you doing? that pie is poisoned!
she just wanted to ride bikes through new england. but those seats hurt my ass!
i get the drumstick!
okay, okay. if you bite your tongue, does it become a vampire?
super-team -- fly!
hyah! hyah!
whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?
and not the good kind! woo-hoo!
yes! i can fly! see you back at the house! nooooo!
maggie, you can't climb into the tv. if you could, i'd make alex trebek answer some questions.
you can't tell what's inside! of all the times not to have x-ray vision. i'll take... that one. aw, this isn't the right one -- she wants the baby!
you're lucky you're behind glass.
sure, it's easy to slap people when you're hidin' behind that glass!
drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... i'll show 'em -- i'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
the march of progress.
be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.
just don't dress me up like a woman.
tell her "no deal".
hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. sooner or later, everyone meets their "homer."
it may not be a boy. it could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the santa fe lifestyle. just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die.
oh, that's probably because to her, the saxophone is a me, and she doesn't want to end up like you. g'night.
no, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. goodnight!
well, if you check your purse i think you'll find... the seven of clubs!
i am so sorry, marge.
ta-da!
that would be one weird-looking kid.
run!
thank you, four-eyes!
thank you.
your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. so, by the power vested in me, i now pronounce you sweet dreams.
up, a father has his secrets.
all right. we'll get the vaccine.
i thought he was an old clump of rags.
why did burns make us all come here?
or helping a railroad worker grip his sledgehammer!
oh man, this is great. the most evil man in town is in our power. he will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. and anything else my limited imagination can come up with.
marge, it's the golden rule: treat others the way they mess with you.
amen. okay, burnsie, follow the carrot!
already?
yeah, i've done all i can do in that medium.
you're welcome!
no, i'm no-ot! yes i am. the bloody hangman walks on his stubby bone feet through the plague-ridden streets of london...
possibly!
flimsy? this gentle pat says different.
is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken i played, lost to, and ate at the state fair?
way ahead of you.
hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty...
danica patrick in my thoughts!
ended that a little too soon. what they don't suspect is that i'm into this.
stupid dog! let go of that delicious bird!
dearly beloved. i'd like to open this service with the words of emily dickinson: "hope is the thing with feathers..." stupid dog!
marge, listen to the man -- he pays bart's salary.
why can't you support my gibberish? i'd do it if you were stupid!
even my tramp stamp? i got the idea from a show where people regret these.
nicely done, boy.
oh, that's pretty sure. subscription rate, right?
hmm... back yard, back yard, toilet, ocean, don't know, back yard, flanders' mailbox, lenny's freezer, tire fire.
enough chitchat. time for operation dog dump.
i'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches. maybe we should get going.
i mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
ooo, unknown caller! hey! all right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt. you said nobody gets hurt. those were your exact words!
maggie.
i'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
you don't want a christmas tree? that's crazy! next you won't want a christmas ham.
sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could.
why couldn't it have been me?
whose turn is it to cry?
look at that picture!
someday tv will be invented, and it will be free. then it will cost money.
now remember, pack only necessities.
you'll be oh so pleased / when the o.j. is freshly-squeezed / and toast is made from homemade we're gonna go out for breakfast / we'll go out to eat / it'll be any place you choose / as long as it's run by jews / 'cause they don't think this holiday's so great. aloha'oe / aloha'oe... hurry up, kids! we gotta get to the airport!
now nothing stands between us and sunny hawa...
ai-yi-yi-yi!
i got the week off by telling mr. burns i had a neck injury! mr. burns, why'd you come to see me?
coming!
fine, i'll come clean.
no, it's not. i just told a lie so we could go to hawaii.
sh!
sweetie, relax. let's just watch some tv.
huh? what'd i do?
fifty bucks?! that used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!
what the hell?!
since when is all this against the law?
that's almost a thousand dollars!
chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. i meant to write "bride." it's a wedding present.
my bribe!
don't tell me i'm not capable of good behavior! your honor, i would like to request a sidebar.
all that time i'll be stuck in my cell, unable to exercise...
i repeat: unable to exercise...
what? this guy?
can i be johnny undercover?
okay, melvin mafia.
can i keep the name after i'm done?
ayyyy! ohhhh! ayyyy! ohhhh! fuhgetaboutit!
there was barbecue sauce on it.
but i haven't earned his trust if it's based on a lie.
what's a dime store?
beating? what beating? oh. that beating.
please! let me have it! come on! give it to me right in the mouth!
how're you gonna do that?
i'll take care of this.
oregano, basil, rosemary...
yeah. those guys are probably fbi informants.
oh yeah. i got in your gang and you barely know who i am.
well, i guess i could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette.
oh no! no! i... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.
huh?
tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!
don't ask questions! just go!
ayyyy!
ohhhh!
ayyyy.
ohhhh.
no! you're wrong! check again!
poor tony. he didn't deserve this. he was just a soldier in a war he started.
it's not over, marge. it'll never be over. when i shut my eyes, all i see is fat tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach.
oh. well, uh... you wouldn't like it. it's not very good.
no, no, i oversold it.
wow, i've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising.
i understand. i loved him too.
do what you gotta do. the quicker you kill me up here, the quicker he can kill me down there.
wha-- oh, oh, uh, mr. burns? uh, you were cool too.
wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! what kind of a world is this?
and your enemies closer?
fit tony took his cousin's place running the springfield mob. the pressures got to him so he started to eat. soon, he was known as "fit fat tony," then just "fat tony" for short. and me? now, i'm just an average shnook like everyone else. stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. and the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby. and i have to admit, it's a pretty good life.
can't start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.
been a while since our wives got together, huh?
ooh, i got a text!
are you gonna open it?
because you're my best friend in the room.
stupid flanders' wi-fi!
this is late for marge. i assume. i've never been home at this hour.
hey, marge. partaking of the grape, were we?
great. that's great. but i have to get to work in the morning.
well, i've put it off, but today i'm finally getting this garage organized-- guess i'll put these tools away. put 'em on hooks and stuff.
oh, you beautiful man.
god you're hilarious.
i don't like those guys.
time to punch in.
a dinosaur!
huh?
he's washing his hands.
but you do like comic books.
lisa, mash the buttons till something good comes on.
life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
bart, son, if i bought you that bike, you wouldn't appreciate it. because when you get anything you want, you don't want anything you get.
why you little!!!
hm. i never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid. son, i won't strangle you anymore, but i also won't get you that mini-bike.
wish i could, son. i really wish i could.
bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but i didn't think it was the right thing to do. marge, not in front of the refrigerator.
well, in season two, when sam got good grades, he got a very surprising reward. and if you do it, son, you'll get the same.
that's great.
son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work.
well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends.
can't lose that. it's the best picture of me i have.
yeah, i do know a lot about nuclears.
oh yeah? i'll show you. "tv guide offer, one world trade center..."
awww...
because you've been such a great kid lately and i wanted to show you i appreciated it.
hmm, the boy's acting really weird. i did everything that tv show told me to and he's still not happy.
where is he going?
step away from the traitor!
i know what you're saying! i understand food talk in every language!
um... i'll see myself out.
well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the tv.
now all you need are customers. well, better get home to the little woman. do you have plans for tonight?
oh marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties.
well, it's not easy with you talking all the time.
so... chicken.
sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims. what has she done?! i feel like i'm married to richard gere! i can't talk now, i'm talking to myself! no, no, homer, go ahead. thanks, homer, it'll just be a minute. what's up?
yes, that's exactly it!
oh i know.
so lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?
well, i don't know... it's a lot of work.
i do keep it together. uh-oh. usually when it gets this quiet mr. burns is standing behind me.
marge? what are you doing here? this bar is for singles and wingmen only.
probably.
well, i guess i do have a "type."
only my hairdresser knows for sure.
he's dying in a retirement home. now kiss me.
wait! i haven't chosen my mix-in! okay... i'll take some of... that.
mix it in.
he didn't know that! stupid kid. all you do is cost me money. money i could be wasting!
wealthy? hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. eh?
so, what brings you here, mr. chair?
i legally forced him to say "semi".
what?! what's wrong with being roman polanski? he what?... you monster!
observe.
more for me.
it would be an honor!
"family, today i graduate from my anger management class."
pained noises.
oh okay, uh, lenny, hit me with that chair.
woo hoo!
if i find out it's a right number, you're in big trouble.
oscars? what are you talking about? my son gave me this list of awesome things to do in l.a.
hmm... who could possibly want to stop me from accepting an award?
i was born a rollin' eighty, and i'll die a rollin' eighty.
hey, they're like five bucks on ebay.
me! me! i want him every night, and forever and ever! 'cause i love my--
that's great, honey. if you were a boy, you'd be a scientist.
hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains! it does! and there's something else it might be good for.
your kisses feel like raw liver.
come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! i wanna take grampa to have his bellybutton pierced.
oh, because lisa won't tell me what flower it's from.
yeah. but lisa won't tell me how to make it.
huh? this one didn't make me feel anything.
go ahead.
oh yeah -- we better "grump it up."
your grandfather is not a monster. now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town.
walther, let's not be so hasty. who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? besides, our generation's got everything under control! now, if you'll excuse me, i was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. to moe's! flat tire? no problem!
great idea, but i don't have any money.
and i wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! what are the odds of that much time happening?
problem solved. generation awesome does it again!
bart, cheech and chong were the beavis and butthead of their day!
i've failed as a parent. i swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. to the media room!
he's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily! back then we'd play these albums again and again till they were filled with skips and clicks and pops. which was about three times.
hide the dope!
i thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
oh no! chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.
i can't do reefer comedy -- i'm drunk. two different animals.
dave's not here, man!
dave's not here, man!
i'll give dave your message.
my time being wasted was not wasted!
yes! will i get to meet dave?
sweetie, don't worry. i'm gonna come back so horny and angry...
oh. what's it made of? hash? shrooms? lysergic acid diethylamide?
don't worry, cheech. i know all the classic bits of you and chong.
can we get high from the fumes?
hard work? i thought this was gonna be fun.
cheech is sure a lot less cool / than i imagined...
better shut up / cheech is really mad / i wish that i had gone with cho-ong...
oh yeah, a reward from cheech!
what the?!
why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
eurocentric! when do we have wacky adventures?
can we at least get some french fries?
it's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from cheech and chunk.
yes, sir.
marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are "insane?" well, sometimes people can be too.
don't look back, marge. don't look back. let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. we've got something more important to attend to.
tell him how you feel.
come on, surrender to the moment! don't make the mistake i always do of thinking too much before you act!
hold on, lemme get the door here. who are you?
oh, okay, wait, let's start again.
yes?
okay. i'll go get some stuff.
way down here?
okay!
gee, sorry, dave.
but i haven't finished my rituals yet!
all your money and all your stuff.
uh, super bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?
everybody dance now! do, do, do, do / do, do, do, do...
aw, come on, sourpuss. tickle tickle!
tickle tickle too!
tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!
son, i'm really, really sorry. oh, i don't know if i can... whoo!... ever make it up to you. i-- whoo!... but i sincerely whoo!
no one else is doing it. i'm trying to start it. whoo! whoo!
bart's never gonna forgive me for humiliating him.
well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!
--just to counteract the self-confidence--
well of course, i would love to be a more sensitive father. you know that.
i'd like to see you thumb through an extension school catalogue and find one.
please, marge, no! the other negligent dads'll make fun of me! they're so cliquey!
well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. but, oh, you know, the other day, bart, the little dickens, said i had an elephant butt. so anyway, i'm strangling him, and i said to bart...
yeah, strangling. i mean, it's not the only tool in my parenting toolbox, but it's the sharpest! right? anyway, i said "bart"...
i guess it's just how i was raised.
who do you have next period?
wha-wha-what are you doing?
no doc, please! i'm just a little boy!
dr. zander, you made me see my life through bart's neck, and i swear, i will never, ever strangle my boy again.
um, i uh, lied about having health insurance.
oh son, i can't quit drinking any more than i could quit being a man. now it feels like morning. what i am cured of is the blind rage that has soured our otherwise storybook relationship. go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
oh come on, bust your daddy's chops.
why you little...?! i'll teach you to...
can't hurt the boy. can't hurt the boy. what the?! boy, get down from there!
how many more, sir?
these are my keys.
i-i said my keys-ter is ready for a whooping, sir.
what?!
then what do we win?
i don't know...
y'see? you see how that boy pushes your buttons?
son, you and i are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist.
what the? first we work, then i pay, then i have to eat fruit? why was i ever born?
honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, i booked us a couples massage.
masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything.
my ear makes money? hello, boat store? i'd like to order a boat. what do you mean, dial tone?
i forgot why i'm doing this.
okay, maybe secrets are a big deal, but my daughter's a good kid. so why don't you act your age, forgive her and let me down.
i'll save you, lisa! the real magic is raising three kids in this economy! you can put the ball back now.
hmm...
woo hoo! first in line! brought you a gift bag.
and we've got front row seats!
fat tony! i was just complimenting your beautiful girlfriend... while insulting her hideous twin.
oh my god!
yes! i'm so happy i lived to see this day! he did give her the kiss of death, right?
i decorated her car for nothing.
lousy saint louis cardinals. can't win the nineteen eighty-five world series on classic sports.
fat tony! are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at christmas? and then an old italian nun finds it. and she's all... no, no, no, oh, no, no! he's too beautiful to die! ohhhh!
um, i take a special size.
yeah, that's his thing. anyway, fat tony and i think this is a chance to patch things up between you and selma. plus it's a free weekend at the beach.
selma? va-va-va-wha?!
well, if you insist.
wouldn't they be girls?
he's cheating on selma? that's crazy! why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home? i'll just sit here quietly. sorry.
aw, can't we stay one more day? the occurrence and i are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled.
i don't wanna be "that guy," but marge is making me be "that guy."
which is lucky for me because you're always right.
i get to enjoy this, but i'm not responsible. actually, dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too.
fine, whatever. i'll just keep cutting till i hit something solid.
that's just what i was going for! i was going for scary. you did this?! with your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?! and stay out!
woo hoo!
well, i open a lot of crazy things when i'm drunk, but i don't think so.
just call me "homer fingerhands."
marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. it's like a beloved dog that died on your head.
yeah. but what if i can't find any commercial rental property?
oh now, how could someone as young as you know about twenty years ago?
i'm sorry, honey. all day long i have to listen to women talk. not a good time.
oh yeah. men are such dogs, and vice versa. is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?
sorry sarah, i'm retired.
i'd like to see you try.
excuse me.
come on! would you--
right.
i can't. they won't let me. lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands.
suck! of course!
oh my god. like mozart and johnny knoxville, my genius cannot be stopped! there's only one way out -- i'm committing barbicide! why doesn't anything kill me?
aw sweetie, thanks for saving me from the horrible life warren beatty lived in "shampoo." and now it's time to pay you back...
as long as it doesn't involve losing weight or changing my pants.
awww...
cake, will you do me the honor of making my stomach the happiest bag of acid in the world? you will?!
uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car.
maggie!
well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. this is from a gas station men's room. they put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. these are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--
stop who, marge? be specific.
no.
when we see each other again you'll be an old man and i'll be a baby!
so long, suckers!
hey, kids! if i tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? don't drink it!
blimp assassin three.
xbox.
fly the blimp, you spoiled kid!
you're a real jerrrk! why you undead little...!
it's worse than you think. i have to buy you a new anniversary present.
but you learned! you grew!
i thought i was.
awww...
whoa! flanders, this chick does not get our thing!
yeah, language.
hey ned, can i borrow some hair?
don't panic, son. we can bust up teachy and preachy. here's what we do: i'll take flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. you scare rod and todd by telling them krabappel will become their evil stepmother.
ned, let's cut to the chase.
ned, if it's boneheaded to talk you outta seein' edna, then i don't wanna be brainheaded.
oh ned, i never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude.
oh, you beautiful, beautiful wuss.
guys, quit telling the truth!
um... uh... so uh, joey, is wikipedia accurate when it says "walk this way" was inspired by "young frankenstein?"
don't you mean "neighboreeno?"
you stupid jerks! i can't believe you could be so cruel! especially you, joey kramer!
wha? my doctor said "don't walk."
ned, i've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! endless, endless forgiving! and didn't the easter bunny himself say "forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?" and if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and edna can find a way to make it work.
there's a whole host of voting options -- friends with benefits, frenemies with frenefits, super friends with wonder pets, all designed to distract you while we take your personal information and use it to apply for credit cards in your name.
right. teasing. i'm waitin' for ya. also, if you wanna find the real shooter of mr. burns, go back and look for more clues. they're all there!
quiet steps are what i take / sneaking in at noon... just in time for my lunch break / got my fork and spoon
i'm still drunk from last night, / got driven home, i don't know by whom. some may say / i don't deserve any pay, but hey / i came up with "sixties day" last may! while i'm here, i might as well pre-punch out... hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. better put in some overtime.
uh, listen, if you could indulge me... larry and i fist-bump every morning. like that... the warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.
wha?! sheez!
good ol' larry. say... wayne, i couldn't help but notice that your breath doesn't smell like alcohol. you want to go grab a beer after work?
well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping.
as god as my witness, this fist will be bumped.
no, a guy at work seems not to like me. i guess it's not much when you look at real problems in the world like major league umpires not using instant replay.
oh. okay.
you know, i just got a little chill when you said my name.
look, i'm not weird or anything, i just like to feel like i'm friends with everybody.
but what if the weathergirl--
wayne?
wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but i think you're awesome.
oh c'mon, stay for dessert!
sure. why not.
of course. i mean, how long could it be?
that's funny, because i have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future.
that robot took our jobs! he said it. or maybe it was him. man, this robot really gets me.
your voice is so gravelly, just like lauren bacall's.
not the one you're thinking of, there's another one.
oh, he's gone. i don't know where he went.
he has no friends. except me!
well, i suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured... hey! wha?! wha?! wha?! no, not the middle seat!
fine. i am being held somewhere in the springfield area. turn the card.
what will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
oh, well way to make me feel obsolete. oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. think, geniuses.
hey, hey! what are you doing? this is no way to treat the talent!
so cold. warm me up.
just let me put my hands under your armpits.
aww, that's what i call closure!
i don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
why of course! even if i don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do. here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... ooh, i need more cash. better go to my invisible atm.
bart, i wanna ask you about something i read in a magazine. are you boys cyberbullying each other?
marge, i parented!
later, losers.
marge, my ice cream's melting and i haven't finished my brownie!
you guys need to get a woman.
are you covering me up?!
the least i can get out of this whole nightmare is some face time on the local news. it's kind of my way of sending a christmas card. happy holidays, everyone! family's fine!
oh, marge. this is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!
oh my god! she's still on the first sentence! must make her stop... how to express my...
i guess my life isn't so bad. with the help of my loving family, i even published my first book...and i've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!
you forgot patty and selma. oh, wait. that hasn't happened yet.
come on! god does crazy things! check your old testament.
hey bart... i mean, jesus. hey son, you want flanders to kill anybody? he's totally in my power.
and i sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?
why you little!... /
assistant? well, i have been pretty overworked lately. but i guess i should find out a little bit about you.
so your dad has money to lend?
uh-oh, it's old man burns! hello, young man burns.
oh well!
thy will be done, lord vader. please don't hurt me. please.
awww... marge, get my seal club! the big one!
hm. why would a homer humiliator do this to me?
someone snitched? wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
up or down?
what the-- this is a gentleman's club!
can't, marge. i'm fighting for my professional life here. do you know what i just learned? my job is the reason i get those checks every week! and now that i'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! not in physical size, but--
you're mean!
can one of the hundred be making the list?
can some of them be callbacks to earlier ones?
hey.
is this her? c'mon. the apple must be wreaking havoc with the twinkie!
are you aware that "stones" means "man junk?"
that's it! that's it! my nightmare is over! oh flanders, you are my personal savior!
hail flanders! mightier than jesus!
uh, i just came to say that you're perfect. so perfect, i think mr. burns should give you a hug.
i won't say, but his initials are s.f.
hug! hug! hug!
i don't know what that middle word means.
no.
little help?
need more butter! and not the unsalted.
and check these out...
i won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
man, how many quarters does this game take?
and we're in hall d. three halls, three minutes... no problem.
woo-hoo!
yeah i was on today. scary on.
look, honey, a family's like a team. and on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee.
okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a saturday surprise dad day.
that's good, marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system.
oh no, i don't eat anything new unless i've eaten it before!
i don't want to think about food, i want to like it. why drive across town to "savor" a bowl of mystery mush when there's four different krustyburgers we can see from our house? oh, and here's my favorite restaurant: "la fridge!" it's open twenty-four hours a day and there's no dress code!
all right, food nerds, reality check... all the food in those pictures is poop by now. minds blown, you're welcome. i'll remind you kids what real fun is!
and i've got tickets for the grand opening saturday night!
jealous? me?! that is to laugh! the very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
of how much fun i am to be around! it's always a party with fun dad! too sad to walk! too sad and fun to walk...
when i'm sad, i make baseball bats.
really? you'd let me in on your thing? even though i think it's stupid?
when i'm happy, i make birdhouses! kids! guess what? mom invited me to your fancy dinner! i guess fun dad is a foodie now! food dad! food dad! food dad!
fun dad is a foodie now! this is my thing and always will be!
well, actually, i've come around on hipsters. takes a lot of guts to all wear the same hat.
so it's weird -- don't worry, i'll make it fun.
is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?
the experience begins!
ouch, this place is fancy.
well, my wife thinks it's too crazy for me, but i'm gonna prove her wrong. i'm doing this for my family!
marge! this isn't a food restaurant! it's a meth restaurant! a meth-taurant!
here's fifty bucks. for the next two hours, i don't want to know you exist. family fun day.
ex-tinct!
yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?
all right, that's it! forget it! no toys for anyone!
i've waited my whole life to hear that!
so tired... go on without me.
it's not against the law to sleep in a tyrannosaurus head!
a million bucks?
i know five idiots!
the perfect crime, eh?
a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
i'm putting together a tween-lit gang-write.
tween-lit gang-write. but this babar needs a zephyr.
you're the zephyr.
it won't be like kansas city.
the caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
you're in.
relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in shelbyville.
wait, you're gonna be all the guys? how would that work?
the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
i just hope we put in enough steampunk, whatever that is.
the troll twins of underbridge academy.
yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript.
we know, we wrote it.
or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.
no.
how could the publishers change our book? if they had been in charge of the sistine chapel, the whole thing would be vampires -- instead of the pope's private naked dude mural!
oh, that is so untroll-y!
british fonzie is right. our story is actually more important... than money.
kansas city.
woo-hoo! all right!
you switched the drives?
good one... uh... mr. burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke. c'mon, just pick a popular song.
just play the oldest, stupidest thing in your catalog.
going up she goes! up she goes!
it's never good. i always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet...
the last thing i understood in that was "pants."
well, in that case...
woo hoo! no more church! so long, sector 7-g...hello, sector 22-f!
uh-oh, a meeting with the mayor. how do i prepare for that? i see. now, how do i prepare for the meeting with the mayor? i am really enjoying this, but, um... hello! meeting with the mayor? awww... bourbon go bye-bye.
yeah, the governor wrote me a letter to that effect.
i've outgrown you! ah, mr. mayor! more peanut nore?
bo-ring. god, what a great game! and you too can be on the winning team, mr. mayor. the springfield nuclear team.
can you be my dad?
oh sorry, sweetie. bart can read it to you.
and kiss.
please, lisa. i had eighteen martinis today.
my work is so meaningless.
you can't touch electricity, marge. you can't feel it.
it already is killing me, marge. you're the only one i can talk to. my wife just doesn't get it.
my job is my wife. loneliness, my mistress. despair, my sex buddy. angst is a chick i met online, but then it turned out it was really a guy.
tell her i'm at a meeting, not drinking...
of course, of course. family is everything to us company men. now, where shall we go on your vacation?
that's great, let me run the numbers because i really want the simpson account. and give these cigars to your children.
you're not a client. you're the client.
mr. burns, i can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work? oh no you don't.
it all fits. mr. burns, rafting it is.
now relax, dottie. leave everything to me.
not sure what you're going for, but uh... marge, why don't i catch us some salmon?
uh-oh. if you've got that, then...
enjoy the outdoors you stupid kid! this family time is so precious. gotta go.
let's see, my family gives me love and sex. my work gives me money and sleep...
my co-workers are like a family. but in some ways my family is like a family too...
thanks. now if you'll excuse me, i don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old simpson family fun. hey kids, i'm it! i'm okay! and i found some gold!
yep, your worries are over. i'm back to being a boring old safety inspector at a nuclear power plant.
it's closing?! but where will people find clips of old tv shows if they're not housed in a giant building? where? where?
bart! thank god i had this in my pocket. my pants are splitting wide open!
everything's a rip-off of "the honeymooners." margie, you're the greatest.
they were so childless and miserable.
how would you know?
now, let me ask you something: is there a place for an old-fashioned lardass like me on today's television?
now i hate him too.
what about mimes?
good one, boy.
christmas card photos?!!
shut up! oh marge, how would you like some "future sex"?
i meant a week from tomorrow. that's when the new penis gets here.
ooo, a b-mail!
hey, i got a b-mail too! "you have won a valuable prize! open now"...
no, i just like to dress up to eat my carrots and smoke.
who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?
oh, they found it. but don't tell him. this is way cheaper than a nursing home.
see you next christmas!
is it snowing down here?
if those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe i can forgive...
i love you, dad.
finally. the only thing i wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.
absolutely. let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags. high school yearbooks...
don't argue in front of the airport line. strangers are judging our marriage!
marge, do we really need all these feminine products?
yes, but i never use that kind of toothpaste!
woo hoo! can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where i carry my stress. now, if i fart, that's 'cause i'm so relaxed.
yes there is! woo hoo.
huh? what the--
but i have to go to the bathroom!
look, all i want is what everybody wants: preferential treatment! you can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! and why is there moisture between the windows?! and don't wake me up to land! just land!
you can't check my spirit! and why is there moisture in between the windows?! and don't wake me up to land!
because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, i can't go out in public.
they love me! the quiet homer simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. this is the birth of homer simpson, blowhard! i'm on the roll of my life! gimme a scratcher! give me another one! almost a winner!
well, if i could explain myself...
yes. yes! got it!
not so fast!
aw, son. now i regret bad-mouthing you to that girl you liked.
it's still a great honor!
great question. i know you children have never seen your father cry before... marge, do we have any more gravy?
why? oh why?
oh marge, don't worry. people know i'm doing a character, like stephen colbert, or newt gingrich.
don't worry, sweetie. i think i know how to whip up an audience just short of a frenzy.
then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?
only one hundred percent?
now lisa, i'm an entertainer. and you can't entertain and inform at the same time. and if you're access hollywood, you do neither!
eh, maybe i'll vote democrat. the great thing is when they get in they act like republicans.
oh, yes.
huh? who's there? mozart!
can we get some pizza on the way? they sell some at the gas station.
do you give 'em out for fans? 'cause i'm a fan.
what's this? some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?
nerds! you want i should mess 'em up?
but gravy is the freedom where--
it was all a dream! oh marge, oscar madison came to me and told me that politics are serious and important!
yes, the will of the people should not be subverted by demagogues who... hey, what's this? springfield colonial village?! what the? you faked it?! lisa, how could you?!
that's what a play within a play is for!
well, if there's one thing i don't like being taught, it's a lesson. i'm so mad. not only will i endorse ted nugent...but i will call for an end to the direct election of senators.
it's not working... but why?
oh my god, she's right. my lips will say anything, but my eyes know the truth. my ears are keeping their mouth shut. my fellow americans... i am full of crap.
i got a good song fever / a ted nugent fever / something something fever...
i got this song fever we got america fever / we got america fever!
down in front! dammit! why do kids have heads?
but i'm invested in the characters.
i make my own turnoffs. and that, kids, is how you stick it to the towne centre real estate investment trust. no, no, no. woo hoo!
no, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. everyone act like we're buckling up to go home.
leaving? why on earth would you think that?
and ours!
do-over! woo hoo! unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero. draw the curtain.
sweet!
let me just download the complete works of shakespeare. now who's the greatest writer of all time?
and i've created something that created something incredibly popular!
you never showed it to me.
i still wanna see it.
are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
marco! come on, lisa!
fish out of water!
well i'm pretty sure it was in there somewhere.
oxygen... i need oxygen.
we show girls love on valentine's day, and they let us blow stuff up on the fourth of july. i just pray they never fall on the same day.
thanks for reading it to me.
which one do you want?
well, your arms are lanky. it's kind of a long trip down there.
hm, the french have gotten into the wine game. good luck catchin' up with the big boys.
did you say "ultimate frisbee?"
sorry, dad. i was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up.
lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. jeez, pick up a book.
then you have a serious reading problem.
so do your farting now.
don't worry. my last words will be "i can outrun that lion."
and i can drive drunk while i'm actually sober!
oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?
yeah. we're like family to you. i'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy.
we won! woo hoo!
soda, eh?
oh, let's face it. i'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. and there's only one way out: i've gotta man up. okay, manning up... manning up. mannning-- girling down! girling down!
fine. please. put that down.
not you! him!
eh, i'm sick of watching fox. let's get some fresh air. i got the atv's right out back.
helmet? that's springfield talk.
springfield talk!
private plane crashes.
well i've got a really big secret for you... i'm not wearing any underwear.
hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes.
pipe down, boy. i'm sneaking you back into springfield.
pish tosh, smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! nailed it!
do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
ever since the day we met.
someone's downstairs!
all right! you caught us. what are you gonna do about it? throw us out of town again?
nooo!
yeah. non-jerks!
this is the outlands, boy. ideas aren't good or bad, they're just free! power on! i was wrong, there are bad ideas! there are terrible ideas! now i'm over here!
hey lenny, welcome aboard. now, i gotta warn you, if you find a little black thing on your pillow, it won't be a mint.
that's not a choice you get to make.
forget it. we don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
well, i rented that plane.
true, true.
love?! your mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere "love" seem like chewing tinfoil. because today i'm getting it autographed.
by the box lady herself!
wow. i don't believe the simpsons will be shopping at the kwik-e-mart anymore.
apu! what are you doing out of your natural habitat?
would you sign this for my wife marge? she's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
you would do that? oh my god, this might be a marge's birthday where i get sex!
wait one sec, marge. before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever.
the only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. now in three... two... one... i repeat. one... onnnnnnneee... ...onnneee... onnneee...
this yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! from her show!
a pity kiss?! that tears it! i'm gonna call that paula paul and give her a piece of my mind! the phone's dead. normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! hm, a chew-through. what could have... aw... i mean arrrgh!
you let this monster into our home! where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
why you little... i'm gonna get... no, homer. you can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. juries hate that. so instead, boy, i want you to... get in that rabbit cage!
what?
boy, get out of that cage!
i'll poke a broom in there! you know i'm capable of it!
stupid kid. this isn't comfortable at all! i don't see how a rabbit could possibly--
hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?
not now, marge!
what the-- what? no! it can't be! shut up! i'll fix you! yes, master. here car. here, boy.
well, we do.
five hundred dollars? woo-hoo! thanks, boy.
really, anyone? what about the hulk riding a rhinoceros? would you stop him from laughing?
both, but the rhinoceros doesn't know why. he's just trying to fit in.
chief, i believe i have the answer in the back of my car.
mr. burns! save me, panic!
how ya doin' there?
well sir, before i do anything i stop and ask myself, "what would jesus and mr. burns do?"
hey, it's called "karma."
not just the laundry... that would be weird, and you might ask questions. i wanna do all the chores! don't yell at me, brain! this happened on your watch! you have two jobs: thinking and bladder control! i like to watch lamar odom play x-box while his giant wife yells at him. is that so nuts? huh? yeah, shut you up. now, i'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. but just to make sure...
but isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?
deep down, i must be feeling guilty about getting my friends in trouble! and my problem won't stop till i make things right with them. but first, a little more sleep.
i'm sorry. cheese on that? sorry. hey, lenny. sorry. one more announcement: make sure you whack "piñata me" and not real me.
free? uh... free it is!
um, uh... probably just the fire alarm -- try to go back to sleep. you stupid...
son, i'm afraid the uralarm whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke.
kids, there's something i have to tell you -- your mother and i are wetting the bed.
what about cupid? he's smokin' hot.
marge, it's not the diaper, it's what's inside. bum-ba-bum-ba / bum-ba-bum-ba...
great, now death knows.
um nothing... typical dream nonsense.
woo hoo!
oh, lighten up, marge. i take you to the disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the lost and found. well guess what? we're stayin' in this dream forever! whee! i'm in me! / oh! / i love the down parts! here comes!
mom?!
just like my hair.
wow!
why you little... there's nothing in this dream world that can't strangle you!
it's true! i failed the basic duty of childhood. and then when i took bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!
no can do, baby.
so what do i do again?
all right. look at it go! all right! hey, since it's a dream, let's ride our bikes naked around town.
it's just dream hail! ow! oh! ow! dream hail! hey, there's a dream truck!
thank you.
you're outta here, drug-o.
well... i didn't really feel like going to moe's today... thought i might hang out here for as long as i can take it.
yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. i did it when i was in that alcohol-induced coma. so, what's on the agenda?
why did i do that? / it sounds so dull and boring. / what was i thinking?
a surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.
then there's champagne in me! what am i gonna do? it's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. maybe i can sweat it out. oh man, i'd better have some coffee and iced tea.
what about this lemonade?
then i'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! oooh, cake!
cherries! jubilee!
oh lord, i have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. if you can weasel me out of this physical, i will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. amen. now to mumble in a religious fashion. dear god, oh, lord oh god, oh, lord...
comicon nerds!
mr. burns, before i leave, i've got a few things to get off my chest: one: i liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push "popcorn". you don't have to know how long. two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? you know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. so to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought.
woo hoo!
hey, i've gotta tell ya, i'm miserable there. i'm all alone; and when there's some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?
maybe i should be heading home.
will you be my friend?
that's exactly what i'm having! you guys totally get me.
could you give my wife a few lessons?
yeah. so uh... it's five o'clock. time for moe's.
let's go!
we're the same temperature we've always been.
uh, right, right... actually, i'm the designated hitter for all you guys.
fine. don't get your circuits in a bunch.
shut up! shut up! shut up!!!
and here i was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. you know, it's crazy, but...
hush, bionic prince, as i cradle your waning form. such a peaceful end.
no! i'm already using it to put my keys in! now, let me raise this beer to toast...
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath.
when i'm done with my robo-botomies.
flanders, i don't judge a robot by the color of their eyes. i look at their hands, which have turned into buzz saws. sonofa-- why did you do that?
just say "kill me," jerks!
i'm doomed! can they climb stairs?
aren't we getting num-nums?
sorry. before we die, can you tell me how old you really are?
guys, thank you. the words "prime directive" get thrown around a lot these days, but i'm glad yours was saving me. the saddest part is none of this had to happen, if mr. burns had simply trusted the human worker. or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings.
and his arm can be my back-scratcher.
then take us out to sea.
oh, i believe you, but flanders' drill doesn't.
watch whatever you want -- i got you here alive. now i'm gonna visit the only court i could never be in contempt of: food court. now, to save on calories, i won't eat the paper in the fortune cookie.
closer than you think!
long enough that me and marge can be one of those couples who just sit and hold hands.
ooh!
gotta have that!
lovin' it!
it's programmed to my specifications! but i can't afford this...
no.
easy!
c'mon, boy. we've gotta go home. i saved big bucks on the delivery charges.
hmm... seen it. seen it. seen it. british version was better. totally scripted. sued it. stranded? what's that?
well, islands are always entertaining, from gilligan to iwo jima. a plane crash!
what a great opening episode. and i'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!
you know, i should get back to the treadmill.
marge, there're so many mysteries that i need to have solved.
and where will i watch tv?
and where will i walk?
and where...
oh that's such a first-take answer!
spoiler alert! i've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: "coconut cream die."
spoiler!
spoil-er!
thanks, marge. you ruined my show. now i'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now.
well...
okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.
again with "mr. steak!" do you know why i go to mr. steak? because at mr. steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at mr. steak!
bart! there's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. i need you to dare me to fight him! bart's been raptured! and his crap's been craptured!
