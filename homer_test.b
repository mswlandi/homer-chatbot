i don't think you realize what you're saying.
oh.
hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?
up... up... up... up... up... up. don't say anything, marge. let's just go to bed. i'm on the biggest roll of my life.
what are all our friends names again?
it was me! you fell for it!
i've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but i've never had the nerve.
where-where are we going?
no, i didn't... i... oh, you mean inside, don't you?
hmmmm.
marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.
oh.
lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
it's true. it's all true.
marge, you don't know what this fish means. this fish represents a better life for both of us. this fish makes me a champion and a hero.
i never knew what superman saw in her. give me wonder woman! and that golden lariat. she can tie me up any time.
no.
no.
are you?
are you?
bart! stop it!
son, i'm proud of you. i was twice your age before i figured that out.
marge! marge! what's my blood type?
yeah, you have the right to remain silent.
mr. burns... he's okay! jackpot!
i promised my boy one simple thing: lots of riches. and that man broke my promise. well, i've had it! bart, take a letter. "dear mr. burns. i'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. and your caard was just great. in case you can't tell, i'm being sarcastic. you stink!" could you read that last part back to me?
oh, all right. you always do that hand thing! and it usually works.
uh huh.
locked, eh? well, i just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old mr. lock. step aside, boy.
well, i'm still gonna run!
hey, c'mon, joey! do you have to twist my arm?
marge, what does it do?
amen to that!
mmm, thanks -- it looks... hey, wait a minute! just because i'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean i'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! although it is tempting --
no deal.
yes, i'm hearing one right now, while i'm trying to watch tv.
i'm homer simpson, from the simpsons.
wow. how do you do that thing with your feet?
okay. five times nine.
that's all right, son.
was it raining?
thanks a lot, michael. you really helped me get through this. if you ever find your marbles, come visit us.
huh? huh?
marge, i never read a magazine in my life and i'm not gonna start now. hey, a cartoon. "well dear, you always wanted a compact." -- ain't it the truth.
ooh... how about the "v"?
where do you think? this baby never steers you wrong. and it was free. free!
uh-uh.
stupid welcoming mint! y'ello.
yeah, right.
gimme one of those!
oh, here we go again. look, i don't care if ned flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. end of story.
that was a joke?
hmm, let's see. nah. hmmm. heyyyy.
so, flanders, have you sold anything?
ooh, the touch of death.
uh, well actually, moe...
sorry, flanders.
sorry! no cash for neddie! homer keep all money! bye bye neddie! bye bye!
only seventy-five beans!
oh, flanders, i, uh, want to give you your stuff back.
oh, it's all my fault.
c'mon, you lefties. what'd i tell you?
how much does it pay?
son, i'll never doubt you again.
well, not the leader... i mean... oh, it's true, it's true! all the pieces fit.
what a movie. and that blonde cutie. does she have assets.
what?
yeah.
it tastes so bitter. it's like ashes in my mouth!
huh? wha?...
um, grace under pressure is no...
what are you talking about? of course he does.
hey krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?
hey, if you don't like it, go to russia.
i'd like to see that.
okay.
woo hoo! c'mon, everybody. we're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!
i wish i had a monkey's paw.
slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. end of monster. heh heh heh.
i love you, son.
how do you know i was sleeping?
no. bart bit me.
don't worry, i know it's tonight.
the moron next door closed early!
no.
that cost eighty-eight dollars!
marge, if i spend any more time doing these girl things, i'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. no, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. let's see, quick fix, quick fix. ah, i'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
"scot-tish deer-hound." hey, this is a dog!
is there a problem with that?
no. i need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
i know you love me. so you don't get squat. hee hee hee hee.
i was hoping it'd be money.
fine, i will. there's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it. do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
no! no!
i'm your man!
mmm... salty.
going for... eight hour walk.
oh no! what is it, a hippopotamus!
yeah, give us a break, doctor.
shh! they'll hear you.
anything for my little girl. bart! you can't weld with such a little flame. stupid kid.
uh, let's see, bart's friends... well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.
well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.
oh, that's a hobby!
ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, i'm sold.
what boy?
thank you, bill cosby, you saved the simpsons! you know, marge, that bart of ours is a little miracle. his winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... he reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit.
don't be, no. go ahead, leave me. go on, go on and win. no, go on and win without your dad. i'll just sit here in "li'l lightnin'" -- which the simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, i had a son. ow.
i'm not pouting, you are.
shut up flanders. flanders! flanders, flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?
he's not so fat.
run for it boy!
hey, i know a good drink. really hits the spot. i invented it myself...
try lighting it on fire.
nah... marge, i'm too upset to eat -- i think i'll go to moe's. .
barney?
how could you do this to me, moe? this bar was going under and it was the drink i invented that saved it. if there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise.
you just lost yourself a customer.
moe... moe... moe.
i guess so.
homer simpson here.
not any more...
sell! sell! sell! woo hoo! twenty-five dollars! ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer...
you heard?
we could all lose our jobs.
because we send them money?
no.
well, ah, i wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy.
lousy german know-it-alls, who are they to say i'm not safe? oh what's the matter with this thing. no problems here.
nobody loves you. nobody loves you. you're old and you're ugly. nobody loves you. yea, yea, yea yea! nobody loves you...
yeah, and i have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating i always get.
actually, bart, i threw up more than your mother. ... it all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s.
wow, what an ending? who'd have thought darth vader was luke skywalker's father. marge, you're as pretty as princess leia and as smart as yoda.
don't worry. this castle is impregnable!
oh, i wrote down what i was gonna say on a card. stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket.
you know, i had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago.
mucous.
i am?
pfft. now you tell me.
oh!
i will send you every cent i earn for the baby. but you will not see me again until i am a man.
marge?
because i knocked you up?
thanks, mom.
eh, somebody'll cover for me.
oh, sorry.
bart, i'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. well, check out my present!
why, you little... wait a minute. does this mean you like my present?
you must think we're the worst parents in the world.
don't worry, you'll grow into it.
pfft, my heart is just fine. a little beer will put out that fire.
lousy, stupid denver.
huh, they both make a good case.
cincinnati...
oh...
fifty big ones!
that's right. my god, it's like there's some kind of bond between us.
me too, honey.
you got it. moe, twenty-three dollars on new york.
not sunday -- daddy-daughter day.
play on.
boy, i know you're gonna like your present.
look, what's the problem? the kids are happy, you smell like meryl streep, and i've got that foot massager i've always wanted. believe me, marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.
it's a date! so... do you think the cowboys will beat the spread?
oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. i gotta get outta here.
huh?
after i catch my breath... can we... go... home?
hello? hello? is this thing on? hello?
whaa...
all right then.
marge, marge, how do i use the pressure cooker?
c'mon!
well, i gotta go.
you found my baby. oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers.
damn, crappy nails! super glue my butt!
makes you look like you've got something to hide.
well marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. bring on the swear jar. do i have to pay if i hit my hand with the hammer?
you dirty bas... what do ya think, lisa?
bart, this is your teacher? i should start going to parents night.
three simple words. i am gay.
softball? who's next? what's the matter with you guys?
let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
you play right field.
i got it! i got it!
like what?
yes.
good one, lenny.
good for you. maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
bart, i need some lucky numbers, fast! how old are you? uh-huh, and what's your birthday? no kidding. and what's lisa's birthday?... what? you don't know your sister's birthday? what kind of brother are you?
correction. three hundred and eighty million to fifty. so what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?
receipts, ugh.
uh... later. first, i want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... doggie heaven.
i know you're a good man... and i have a dog that's very sick...
chub? i don't even know what that is!
buffalo gals won't you come out tonight / come out tonight / come out tonight... oh buffalo gals...
oh he's gone and he's never coming back. wait! there he is. no... that's a horse.
i know. i want to pet him again!
look who's oinking! "look who's oinking"!
oh wait, i heard how this ends. it turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter. hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it.
yeah...
your song touched me in a way i've never felt before. and which way to the can?
marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'.
come with me!
don't thank me, lurleen, you should be thanking your brain.
i did bad in school.
no!
marge, lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, i'm going to be there.
you, off the bench.
right...
uh... i gotta go.
at least could i have my dollar ba...
look maggie, they have a baby, too.
hear hear!.
come again?
boy, some of the best times i've ever had were in the back seat of a car.
hey, i thought i was supposed to encourage him.
all right. he can stay. but i get to treat him like garbage.
chocolate...
listen, tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. what do you say to that?
disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! a pox on them!
what the hell are you two... oh, my couch! the arms, the seat... the dream is over. all right, who did this?
would i!
oh, my god!! woo hoo! i win!
i'll take it.
herb, let me give you the grand tour. this is one of our many light switches. it functions in both the on and off mode. on... off... on... off.
nah.
all right, herb, i'll lend you the two thousand bucks. but you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother.
i gave herb all the money i had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear.
all right... but i never really hugged a man before.
woo-hoo!
yeah. i didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway.
"leaves of 4, eat some more."
marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here.
she, uh... good for her.
kids, back me up.
you see, marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too.
marge, move it or lose it!
well i gotta, don't i?
maggie, time to go to the... babies.
yeah. how blanche was sad and how that guy stanley -- should have been nice to her.
forget it. i'm not going.
woo-hoo!
i... found... a penny! could this be the best day of my life? looks like we have a new champion. ah, my beloved family. how was church?
and what if we picked the wrong religion? every week we're just making god madder and madder.
no. they moved to phoenix.
don't worry, sweetheart. if i'm wrong, i'll recant on my deathbed. hello, my animal friends. peace be with you. guys, please, could you give me five minutes?
well, you should join my religion, moe. it's great. no hell... no kneeling....
there you go again. always taking someone else's side. flanders... the water department... god...
no offense apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz.
well, the picasso... my collection of classic cars...
i'll be there next sunday. front row, center!
ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!
oh my god!
how about you, barney?
uh, was your second wish to be entered in the little miss springfield pageant?
hey there blimpy boy flying through the sky so fancy free --
they'll love you just as much as i do.
really?
ooh, that's bad.
woo hoo!
the doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me! ew. dog water.
well, she was. and she hit him in the head with a golf club!
but the car is okay?
barney! not you, too!
all right. tell you what. i'm thinking of a number between one and 50.
i did. i did read to her!
he's the boy you love to hate.
bart, don't tell your mother, but i brought you some pizza. just promise me you'll try to be good.
bart! why are you doing that?
all right. all right. bart, go to your room.
all right, marge. i swear to you, the next time he does something wrong i'll punish him and make it stick.
yummy, yummy, yummy/ i've got love in my tummy/ and i feel like lovin' you... ... love you, such a sweet thing/ good enough to eat thing...
i know you're upset right now, so i'll pretend you didn't say that.
all right. i think you've learned your lesson.
yeah, but what're ya gonna do?
ready!
wait a minute...
marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. we only have five hundred in the bank. that leaves... eighty- hundred we need.
it's in there. look, marge we just don't need the money that bad.
don't worry, baby. that tube'll know what to do.
well, i won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks i'm lazy. i'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... eh, goodnight.
ooh, me too. ahhh, bacon.
come on, marge. maybe i'm not getting enough ...estrogen.
great. oh, uh... and there was something else. something i was supposed to tiptoe around...
all you can eat. all you can eat.
no!
woo hoo!
thanks, that means a lot to me.
it's a pornography store. i was buying pornography.
what? you think i'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise?
not as low as my low, low prices. uh, huh, that's mr. plow.
get out of here, you lousy... season!
well wishing won't make it so. you've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn barney you can be.
how could you, barney? after all i've done for you.
all right.
uh... all of them. they're having a party. jimmy carter's passed out on the couch.
barney, that's great. when two best friends work together, not even god, himself, can stop them.
yeah, tell it, mom.
ye-esss...
oh.
mmmm. hog fat.
you didn't build this house. you won it on a crooked '50's game show!
eh, you don't want to hear that story. i know! i'll tell you about the time i got locked in the bank vault with mr. mooney. it was another one of my hair-brained schemes.
i could use a tv tray.
duh.
shut up, flanders.
can you say "daddy"?
y'know, maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back. i hope you never say a word.
what the hell is this?
huh?
hey, c'mon, quit it.
what an age we live in!
could you dumb it down a shade?
i do enjoy a snifter of port at christmas.
can i have a free calendar?
well, marge, we could do worse.
uh, yeah.
who are you donating them to?
cloud goes up. cloud goes down. cloud goes up. cloud goes down...
barney, i'm not getting a sex change!
like a giant billboard that says, "no fat chicks"?
mono...
marge, i want to be a monorail conductor.
heh-heh. kids.
what if i talk like this? what if i sing to you? i gave my love a chicken that had no bone/ mmmm chicken.
i call the big one bitey.
batman's a scientist.
and i'm a college student! heh, heh.
hey you don't hear lisa complaining.
all in favor of skipping the poem? thank you.
i'll give it a good home.
no! duff... gardens... hurrah!
sounds great!
homercles cares not for beans. hi, kids. how was duff gardens?
marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. and to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. permit me to demonstrate.
hit me.
how would you like me to take it? "go ahead, bart, have your fun, i'll be waiting for you?" i'm sorry, i can't do it.
son, your life is gonna get better -- starting now.
"learned," son, it's pronounced "learned."
come on, bart. we had our fun. remember when i used to push you on the swing?
that's right. and who might you be?
sure, boy. first, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. that's when it's time to kick some back. and then when he's lying on the ground...
uh, kind of. nobody makes a big deal out of valentine's day.
sold!
"i'm married to the sea," "i don't want to kill you, but i will--
yeah, they'll do that.
you know, one day honest citizens are going to stand up to you crooked cops.
whelp, time to go to work. roll in at nine, punch out at five. that's the plan. then to the duff brewery. i gotta think of a lie, fast.
mmmm... gummi beer. hey, barney. i think you've had enough.
your honor, i'd like that last remark stricken from the record.
then, yes.
deer.
t.v. have you turned on me, too?
marge, i'm going to moe's. send the kids to the neighbors, i'm comin' back loaded.
i hope they kill that iron yuppie. thinks he's so big.
and gummy joe, where would you be without the dental plan?
mmm. gratzi.
sorry, mr. burns, but i don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. sure, i'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no.
hired goons?
i'm gonna resign. i don't know why they made me union president in the first place.
by the big cooling tower...
you couldn't fool your mother on the foolingest day of your life if you had an electrified fooling machine.
ah, beer. my one weakness. my achilles heel, if you will.
arrrgh!
thanks for coming to visit me, moe.
oof.
they're fine.
marge, i never graduated from high school.
no, they weren't all happy days. like the time pinky tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night i lost all my money to those card sharks, and my dad, tom bosley, had to get it back.
homer's not here, man.
what can i say? it hasn't been easy staying in my rut...
all right. but if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar.
true.
that's my boy. mmmm, beer... what?
whack! whack! whack!
uh-oh.
marge, the boy's wasting valuable time -- come change the channel and pat my head. but, i'll miss "sheriff lobo."
now, come on! i'm your best customer.
go up to the attic. there's a whole trunk of clothes up there.
i'll figure it out. i'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
now, you can stay with us until you lose that weight. you can sleep on the sofa, it folds right out. oh, wait. that was the old sofa.
hello...
just leave it to me.
far out, man. i haven't seen a bong in years.
yeah, but i'm not gonna let it change our lives. i'll be the same loving father i've always been.
oh man.
all the time. it was the title of our second album! but we were about to learn an iron law of show business: what goes up must come down.
are we hot?
oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! oh wait, it's for bart.
is that so? oh, flan-ders! won't you join me in my kitchen?
this isn't just because of sideshow bob. it's a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.
no problem.
bart! don't interrupt!
you guys are pathetic. no wonder smithers made me head bee guy.
so you want me to go to college?
son of sniglets??
sorry, son, but there's a program about campus life that i really should watch.
how long have you been back there?
do we have to?
yeah, you've won this round, dean. but the war isn't over.
really? but nerds are my mortal enemy.
those bastards...
absolutely. now the only antidote to a zany scheme is an even zanier scheme.
exam?!? oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams.
mora wuza?
oh, marge. you're worse than that crusty old dean. well, i guess it's back to college for me. and that means it's time to... what did i teach you guys?
i'm writing a delicious send up of mr. burns for his birthday party. is poo poo one word or two?
are you ready to laugh?
blah, bla... unghhhh!
yes sir. reject the first offer. reject the first offer.
hmmm. sixty-four slices of american cheese. sixty four... sixty three...
marge, you must hate me for not taking mr. burns' money.
eh, it's about the same. uh-oh! look out, smithers! i love this show well well, look whose come to apologize.
do you have a donut or not?
uh, huh.
marge, look at all this great stuff i found at the marina! it was just sitting in some guy's boat!
yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.
kill my boss? do i dare live out the american dream?
you have to kill the head vampire.
marjorie, please. i enjoy all the meats of our cultural stew. ahhh, ballet.
phht, that's just an old wives tale.
marge, that's twice. i think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman.
will you bring me back something?
wait a second... you kids do need a baby-sitter.
come on marge. it's fun to smash things. i smashed it good! you got real purdy hair.
oh my god. they're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. and it's all my fault! marge! marge!
heh. heh. stupid animals. ahh, the daily newspaper. oooh! the springfield men's shelter is giving away sixty soiled mattresses!
and i can just haul it away? free?
kids, kids, once you get hurt, move aside and let other people jump.
name one thing you've done in the past month that was fun.
marge, i'm feeling a lot of shame right now.
i just thought i'd remind everybody. after all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar.
hey, boy! in here!
oh, i'm sorry.
marge, don't discourage the boy. weaseling out of things is important to learn. it's what separates us from the animals. except the weasel.
heh heh. you don't have a son.
so many krustyburger locations.
woo-hoo! see that, boy? your old man was right, not flanders. we are doomed! in your face, flanders!
it's better to be safe than sorry. sorry.
the foul stench of death is upon us. mmmm... hamburgers.
and we won't be able to pee in the drinking fountain. i mean... you know if we wanted to... not that i... ever did.
mindy has a motorcycle.
okay, so we have one thing in common. but you know what i hate? drinking beer and watching tv.
uhhh.
nooo! who are you?
then we're all happy.
no, lisa, i swear to you. i'm one-hundred percent completely serious. you've got to turn around right now before it's too late.
stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it.
oh. something's missing. ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed. mmmm... foot long chili dog.
okay.
well, maybe i want to. but then i think about marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. sometimes i'd just like to...
i got a job at burns' casino. as you know, it's been my lifelong dream to become a blackjack dealer.
y'ello? and then i said to the president... get this marge? marge?
this late? through the bad neighborhood?
woo hoo! problem solved!
aw. just like on tv.
you broke a promise to your child.
aw, what a gyp.
shhh, quiet lisa.
lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down.
sorry, dad. you're too old.
put this in your pipe and smoke it.
return to your homes and places of businesses! hey you, where'd you get that saxophone?
lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas. literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination...
uh... marge?
he'll show.
oh, this doesn't work any more. i didn't say stop.
no kidding.
oh, nothing.
it's okay, son. who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? you're doing what you want to do with your life. nothing else matters.
don't forget to say "i didn't do it".
this shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
no way, man no way, man. get yourself another patsy, man. no way am i wearing a freakin' wire.
oh.
stop being such babies. you can't be afraid to try new things. for instance, tonight i'm using a... apu, what do you call this thing again?
that's okay.
i'm coming with you. i got you fired, it's the least i can do... well, the least i can do is absolutely nothing. but i'll go you one better and come along.
are we in india yet?
well that was a big bust... is he really the head of the kwik-e-mart? no need to apologize, apu. it was as much my fault as it was yours. okay, apu, i accept your apology.
woo hoo!
marge, that's what i bought it for!
marge, lisa, lady -- if you'll excuse me, i've got something very important to attend to.
what, what does it say? i want to see.
good. listen, i'm sick of your boring space launches. now i'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but i know what i likes on tv...
i'll take care of this.
you mean i shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
wow! former president james taylor.
yeah, maybe i do have the right... what's that stuff? anyway, thanks, marge, lisa.
not flanders. anybody, but flanders.
huh?
well, i guess i should pay my share...
professional athletes. always wantin' more.
watch this, ned. they don't call me springfield fats just because i'm morbidly obese. now you got a law suit on your hands. just kidding.
hiya, flanders! oooh... dinner! may i join you?
oh of course you'd say something like that, marge. you've hated ned for years. in fact, you wanted to bash his head in with a pipe.
food fight!
right, no reporters.
right back atcha, buddy. now how 'bout that game at the pitch 'n putt?
push her down, son.
what's the point of all this cleaning? are we so vain?
he's taking the elephant instead of the money.
marge, i agree with you, in theory. in theory communism works. in theory.
plants, eh?
hey, what's with them?
i don't have time to read. just give me the gist of it, son.
he likes peanuts.
lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
he took bart too? that wasn't part of our deal, blackheart! that wasn't paaaaart!!
huh?
mmm. caramel.
oooh. he card reads good.
woo hoo! we're rich! bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. we want to get the old people smell out before we move in.
okay. lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
or what? you'll release the dogs? or the bees? or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? well go ahead, do your worst. he locked the door! i'll show him.
because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
but marge, dogs can never have enough excitement. look! ree, ree. ree, ree. aye, aye. all right, all right, i won't take the dog. c'mere.
i know you can read my thoughts, boy. meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
so "if" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be "deadlocked" and have to be "sequestered" in the springfield palace hotel.
i'm not stealing it. hotels expect you to take a few things. it's a souvenir.
or, if not then, christmas.
well, i'm opposed to the whole thing! damn opposed!
dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him.
woo hoo!
how dare you call me that?!
wait a minute, even lenny is teaching a class. look at the way they admire and adore him. that's it! if he can teach a class, he can teach a class. i mean, i can teach a class.
incorrect, marge. two perfectly good jackets.
ew. okay, let's get started. no talking.
no, that's not what i meant. marge and i always talk things over in bed. like the other night we were fighting about money.
look, marge, you don't know what it's like. i'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. and i'm not out of order. you're out of order. the whole freakin' system is out of order. you want the truth? you want the truth? you can't handle the truth. 'cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. forget it, marge - it's chinatown.
well let's just call 'em uh, "mr. x" and "mrs. y." so anyway, mr. x would say, 'marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't homer j. simpson.'
son, i know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.
but i'm not in the cla...
i love you... will you marry me, marge?... you mean i'm gonna be a daddy?... i hope we'll always be together... together... together... together?
okay, thirty.
wait a minute! wait, that's it! i know now what i can offer you that no one else can. complete and utter dependence.
hey, moe!
i understand. let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.
chlorine, eh?
you're steerin' fine, boy... hard to the right!
that's because i've loaded it with sugar!!... marge, our ship has come in! i found five hundred pounds of sugar -- in the forest -- that i'm gonna sell directly to the consumer. and all for a low, low price of one dollar per pound.
oh am i, am i really? a-ha!
deal!
there you are. thought you could get away, huh?
hi.
oh!
but they're so sweet.
sure.
oh, everything's too damned expensive these days. look at this bible i just got. fifteen bucks! and talk about a preachy book! everybody's a sinner except for this guy.
ah, the interstate. fasten your seatbelts, kids. we're on our way to itchy and scratchy land!
trust me, marge. with today's modern cars you can't get lost. what with all the silicon chips and such.
parents island?
lisa, don't contradict your elders. my hair! you chopped off my hair! oh god i'm ugly!
that's better.
uh-huh.
john denver.
you don't look so happy.
must kill family. .
hey, what the hell is that geek flanders doing on tv?
nothing. nothing at all. let's just eat. eh. close enough.
yeah, and then we'd get the chair.
why you little... how can you look me in the eye and lie like that?!
i like those odds.
i tried.
okay, hon. sucker. competitive, violent, that's why you're here.
hey! apu just called. this friday lisa's team is playing bart's team. you're in direct competition. and don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. i want to see you both fighting for your parents' love. fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
well, you can't possibly like maggie best. what has she ever done? nothin' for nobody!
ma-arge. they can't carry enough candy. they have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you.
mmm hmm. keep going.
wait a minute. wait a minute. where's my gummy de milo? okay, don't panic. she can't have gotten far; she has no arms.
marge, i swear i didn't touch her. you know how bashful i am. i can't even say the word "titmouse" without giggling like a schoolgirl.
well, that's kind of a gray area.
hmm, i saw that report you did on sasquatch. it was fair and evenhanded. i'll do it.
ooh, "portrait!" sounds classy... doesn't it?
oh, i wouldn't want to be mr. t right now.
and ted koppel is a robot.
marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but i promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.
faucet's jammed into my back... i'm stuck.
no.
yeah... where are my pants?
dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? maybe i could've been something more than i am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.
i know, but you're never supposed to tell the child.
wheeee! wheeee!!!
so are you gonna say something nice now?
it's raining men?
thank you!
but i -
come on marge, i want to shake off the dust of this one-horse town. i want to explore the world. i want to watch tv in a different time zone. i want to visit strange exotic malls. i'm sick of eating hoagies. i want a grinder, a sub, a foot-long hero. i want to live, marge! won't you let me live? won't you please?
lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again.
well keep it up, then.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. first, what are your qualifications?
that's okay. you don't have to make her into some kind of superwoman. she can get on a plane. that's plenty.
i do... now. anyway, i'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go.
so, one of those egg-counsel creeps got to you too, huh?
not as such, no.
aw, thanks, lenny. when am i gonna be initiated?
i think i have to do it again. my blindfold came off.
but what if i were to shake your hand in this wise?
you wanna see how davy crockett really died at the alamo? you must be 18.
what? did i miss something?
no.
you know, i think you guys are lettin' me win.
couldn't hurt -- unless the monkeys start hurting people... which they almost certainly would.
quiet. i will not hear another word against the boat.
well, i'm glad you asked. it's actually a very interesting story.
don't worry about homer j. i've got a plan. a plan that'll fix you good.
why?
everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. i hope things stay exactly like this forever.
...i slowly learned the intricate mysteries of the alley, like where the pins go after they're knocked down. i was in heaven. if horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well.
this is getting very abstract, but thank you. i do enjoy working at the bowling alley.
you're pregnant again?! well who wouldn't be upset? that new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from sunday! hey, where're you going?
yeah, a raise! i've never been good enough at any job to deserve one before. but i'm damn good at this one. that's it! i'm gonna march right up to al and say...
seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
okay.
yeah, except i forgot to go to work.
all right!
get out of there. my family needs to use your bomb shelter.
wait a minute. we all know the one thing we won't need in the future: left handed stores. that's you, flanders. i'm terribly sorry. flanders is the only useless person here. if anyone dies, it should be him. i'm sorry. please forgive me. so let's kick flanders out. sorry.
marge.
ooh, i've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life.
omigod! he's stealing all the burgers! why you little - i've got you!
uh, can't. i've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo.
hey, he didn't give me a ticket! this is an intriguing development.
putting speed holes in my car. makes it go faster.
but, i've never been able to do the... how 'bout if i just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere? okay. i'll never be able to do this trick... never.
burkina faso? disputed zone? who called all these weird places? no, i'm gonna ask marge.
all bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to australia?
no. it's pretty big, i guess.
yeah, there's a lot more mucus!
all right, let's not panic. i'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. i can get by with one.
uh, could i just get a look at that?
gosh, moe, i use these all the time. couldn't you just bash my head in?
well, lisa, i managed to solve a little problem today. and to celebrate, i'm going to tilt my chair. mmmm, slanty.
no! i'm giving them a foot massage. at least let me have that.
no! don't tell marge! i'll be good. i'll be good!
you told!
that's it! i'll make money with a chauffeur job. good thing you turned on that tv, lisa.
oh, okay marge, i'll get along with them. then i will hug some snakes! yes, i will hug and kiss some poisonous snakes. now that's sarcasm.
well, i...
i didn't do it for them. i did it for you, marge. i'd kill for you. please ask me to kill for you.
but what can i do? i'm just... one man.
oh, you're right. there ya... just second... oh, that should...
yeah, well scooby doo can doo-doo... but jimmy carter is smarter!
okay! wait a minute. that's bad! look, i know i'm not witty like that critic guy. but does he know all the words to the oscar mayer song?
but ... the ball... his groin!... it works on so many levels! roll it again.
marge, i've got some serious thinking to do. hm. barney's movie has heart. but football in the groin had a football in the groin.
sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that i mightst sup on suckling pig this noon.
yo, hugh. here's a little bit of u.s. hospitality. what do you think of that?
i said, pull my finger.
hey, how are you. nice to meet ya. you know what's great about you english? "octopussy." man, i must have seen that movie... twice.
i found them on the night stand this morning. i guess they weren't his cup of tea. don't worry about it.
did they?! hmm, i guess bart's not to blame. he's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and i've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'.
don't worry. as soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. believe me, i know.
now it's two sets of twins.
your mother and i have been thinking about giving the puppies away.
a little too well, if you ask me. i'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies.
marge, anyone can miss canada... all tucked away down there.
man, these are primo seats. i could really go for a hot dog.
remember, honey?
jazz. they just make it up as they go along. i could do that. dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
woo hoo! easy money!
easy now, sweetheart. homie's here.
oh marge, one squirt and you're south of the border. mmm. incapacitating.
"the girls of the internet." ooh, i'd go on line with them any day.
oh, you've become such a cop! and, not that long ago, you were so much more to me - you were a cleaner of pots, a sewer of buttons, an unplugger of hairy clogs.
i'll be right back. now keep your eyes peeled for a real cop.
lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
hey herman, i had to come out here to see what's so funny - a counterfeit jeans ring operating out of my car hole! i'm gonna tell everyone! wait here.
oh, marge. you saved my life! i'm sorry i teased you. you're a really good cop. i'm proud of you.
what for? nobody cared when bogart defaced that sidewalk in hollywood.
i don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!
woo-hoo!
that's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now marge?
homer simpson! homer simpson! shut up! homer simpson! my name is homer simpson!
my tool shed! oh dad!
i swear, i've never seen that gun before.
say it burns. say i never shot you... before.
hooey! whew, oh. you know, i never walk out of a movie, but eech!
oh, never you mind...
yeah. if that mafia guy weren't staring at us, i'd take off my towel.
i can see lisa... but it might be a starfish. i've gotta call 'em!
listen. yes, i know.
i wish i knew something about the baby i could miss now.
oh no! in the eyes of god they'll be flanderseseseses!
oh, there's my sweet little maggie.
i got it! madman moe's pressure cooker!
and he knows my name.
no.
out of the way, you. aww.
wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. lisa, honey -- are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? what about bacon?
that's a typo.
here ya go!
marge, tell bart i just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like i do every morning.
that's it. go to your room.
eggheads. what do they know? hee hee hee. i've got your donut, lard lad! and what are you gonna do about it?
mmmm.... sprinkles.
oh, no. better ride this one out in the closet.
that's weird. it's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
hey! i don't want to alarm you, marge... but i seem to be trapped in here.
help me! are you helping me, or are you going on and on?
craaaaaaaaaap!
stupidity, eh? must hurt self. must hurt self. must hurt self.
yuh-huh, that's the deal. no more exercise program! no more traffic! no more blood drives or charity walks!
can you recommend a doctor who will?
any time i want. hey, flanders, bad day at the rat races?
well, that's a plus. woo hoo hoo hoo! i did it!
i pity those poor suckers on the freeway. gas-brake-honk. gas-brake-honk. honk-honk-punch. gas-gas-gas. eight fifty-eight. first time i've ever been early for work. except for all those daylight savings days. lousy farmers. "to start, press any key." where's the "any" key? i see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. there doesn't seem to be any "any" key. all this computer hacking is making me thirsty. i think i'll order a tab. check core temperature? yes-slash-no. yes. core temperature normal. not too shabby. "vent radioactive gas?" n-o. venting prevents explo-si-on. this is hard. where's my tab? okay then -- yes. vent the stupid gas.
pro: i'm drought and famine resistant.
could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer--
i got someone to cover for me.
wait, i know! "vent gas." pressure too high? tank must be shut down manually?! stupid bird! i never should have put you in charge! why you... oh, who am i kidding? it's all my fault. shut up! i gotta call the plant and warn them!
mr. burns... can you make me thin again?
that's m'name.
some people say i look like dan aykroyd. i can't believe you're here. dad always told me you died while i was at the movies.
hey, mom, lookit me! look at what i can do!
i 'unno. i guess i was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
seven!
it's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. but who are you, and why did you tip us off?
that sideshow mel thinks he's so big. whatever happened to sideshow bob?
well, i wrecked the gate but you don't hear me bragging. now let's roll.
relax. what is mind? no matter. what is matter? never mind.
do i smell cookies? where's the cookies?
bart! where are ya, boy.
yabba dabba doo! simpson, homer simpson / he's the greatest guy in history / from the town of springfield / he's about to hit a chestnut tree hey guys, look what i smuggled aboard.
well, you'll be happy to know i don't work very hard. actually, i'm bringing the plant down from the inside.
i know how you feel, bart. when i was your age, i wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. well, goodnight.
hey! i don't remember saying that!
i've figured out the boy's punishment. first: he's grounded. no leaving the house, not even for school. second: no eggnog. in fact, no nog period. and third, absolutely no stealing for three months.
no, i want roast beef, you clod!
uh... that longhair freak's bowled with us for years.
uh... excuse me, mr. burns?
it's a 7-10 split.
but... but...
then what are you dressed like that for?
uh, mr. burns, next week is the big championship game...
goodbye, trophy.
eh. i'll do it anyway. come on, boy, we're going to see the neighbors.
but, marge, it works on any ayatollah! ayatollah nakhbadeh, ayatollah zahedi... even as we speak, ayatollah razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power!
and for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
i voted for prell to go back to the old glass bottle. after that, i became deeply cynical.
i'm going to punch george bush in the face!
then we're agreed. there'll be trouble.
he's not lost.
you didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs! never!
yes, mr. ford!
spurlock's cafeteria it is.
you should've held out longer, boy.
really?
he got to the green in one shot?! how - can - that - old - man - hit - so - far?!!
i'm driving up to the main building. they've got valet parking tonight.
poor aunt hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...
that's for my master to decide.
okay.
i believe you, honey.
oh yeah? well, put this in your fife and smoke it!
what do we win if the tongue is there?
get lost! hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!!
uh, mr. smithers? i don't understand 2700 of my new duties.
uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? the things?
yes! yes, sir!
except... i killed mr. burns.
mr. burns, is there anything at all i can do for you?
got it. i'm transferring a call into you, mr. burns.
i'll show you.
will do.
okay. grampa.
well, it's not quite a mop, and it's not quite a puppet, but, man... so to answer your question, i don't know.
down in front!
i don't know.
the way i figure it, if the candy stays in the machine for more than a year, it's up for grabs.
all right, dare.
i have no idea who that is.
yes, that's a real pickle. would you excuse me for a moment?
forget the name homer simpson. have it sent care of... langdon alger.
where are you two going at this hour?
oh, i heard it at the mustache parade they have every year.
uh-huh.
you? pfft. i don't believe it.
don't forget ganesha.
correct. now we all know the thirteen stripes are for good luck. but why does the american flag have precisely 47 stars?
yeah, native americans like us.
i see these kids now with "jive" printed on their shirts. now, i can teach you how you're supposed to say "jive"...
the us festival! geez! it was sponsored by that guy from apple computers.
i went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music i'd never heard of. it was like the store had gone crazy.
hey, a freak show!
what did i say? what's going on?
you know, marge, in some ways you and i are very different people...
we've got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down; if it's black, send it back.
die? well, you don't scare me, doc. 'cause dying would be a stone groove. got any messages for jimi hendrix?
oh, this is heavy. okay, homer, don't fear the reaper. oh, i'm gonna die.
so lame that it's cool?
bye-bye, job.
hey, he looks just like you, poindexter!
well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids.
oh my god, marge, it's escaped!
we think we saw hugo at the airport! he was boarding a plane to switzerland and... oh.
no! no! what are you spraying me with!?
i'm homer simpson, sir, and i'm gonna get you back to washington before it's too late!
promise not to laugh? i always wanted to own the dallas cowboys.
thank you! come again!
here we are, 15201 maple systems road... our new home.
yes sir, i will notice that. very casual, mr. scorpion.
ye... no.
could you, um... work any harder than this?
all right... what's the number? sir, i need to know where i can get some business hammocks.
right...
no?
eh, you have any sugar around here?
what?! we've got it great here. and for the first time in my life, i'm actually good at my job. my team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions.
nothing big. it's just a lot of little things.
look, marge! they opened a new high-tech gadget store! you love high-tech gadgets!
yesss, they are a clever bunch. i know, i'll squeal for you. to their parents.
you really think i could do it?
wow! i've never been in here before!
lousy democrats.
then i can just push him over.
gee, thanks, moe... what's this?
uh, well... i was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!
gotcha.
eh, not mine.
ooh, let's pick him up!
he made fun of my weight.
oh, all the time! have you ever heard of this kid milhouse? he's a little wiener who...
hiding out? marge, you've been reading too many hideout books.
just a second.
the abandoned warehouse!
sorry, sorry. my fault.
you know, i don't know.
i have misplaced my pants.
i don't care if he was filling in for mel zetz! he's my son and i don't want him -- working... so... late... that...
no! i only learned that four days ago.
take it off!
yup, pretty much. except we drove around in a van solving mysteries.
i just gotta put my shoes on.
that's a door?
i sleep in a big bed with my wife.
okay. love you.
it can't just be sex. it can't.
'cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
i wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. how many husbands would do that for their wives?
i didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on tv. this one is for real. i want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like kirk and luann.
hey, what's this thing?
tele-panhandling.
hey, who shot the auto-dialer? marge's auto-dialer?
okay, it's the standard grampa drill. everybody into the cellar!
now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
hey, i got off pretty easy.
aw, that's it. you just can't insult this guy. you call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly.
hello? oh, hi, lenny... no. why would i need a ride this afternoon? where? to the big annual what? lenny? aw, well. if it was big and annual i'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper. yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. but something's a little off... hey, marge, you don't smoke!
stupor pooper.
uh, wiggy...? my chili's gettin' cold.
who said that?
you know, i have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and i would -- hey!!
wha? golf course? did i dream that whole thing? maybe the desert was just this sand trap... oh, and i bet that crazy pyramid was just the pro shop!
oh, honey, i didn't get drunk. i just went to a strange fantasy world. c'mon, you gotta believe me. you're my soul mate.
well, i won't be lonely for long....
right, and we don't like the same things. it's like you're from venus...
the light! we gotta get the light back on!
hmm, bold -- refreshing... and something i can't quite put my finger on.
it was an alien, marge! it appeared in front of me and said, "don't be afraid!"
yes. remember, it's the same day as the dog's?
well, the evening began at the gentleman's club, where we were discussing wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
no, i refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks i'm crazy. unless you're feeling... amorous?
that's my boy. well, if you believe in me, then i'm not going to give up. i'll prove i'm right. this friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!
yeah, me too. it's him!
this interview is over!
what do you need to make money for anyway? as long as i have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about. ow! oh! call work and tell 'em i won't be in tomorrow.
that means thank you, marge.
yeah, my wife is raking it in.
so what are we gonna do?
i think i won, mr. burns.
uh... yes sir. i thought i was supposed to.
uh, not as such.
no going through the window for us!
oh?
i think when we yelled we caused another avalanche.
oh... okay.
burnsie!
your mother seems really upset about something. i better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.
good for you, son. giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. have a dollar.
i like him!
well, so am i. okay. question two -- who was your last employer?
come to bed, marge.
you've changed me as well. i'm no longer the money-driven workaholic i once was.
indubitably! around the house, i never lift a finger / as a husband and father i'm sub-par / i'd rather drink a beer than win father of the year / i'm happy with things the way they are.
i prefer to listen to cheap trick.
oh, now i got the job, huh? oh. thank you.
uh, i guess. is this episode going on the air live?
well, at least i liked it. didn't i?
hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! those finks double-crossed me!
no. how can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? you're a grown man.
do i know you?
couldn't agree more. happy as a clam.
you know me, marge: i like my beer cold, my tv loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming.
uhh... huh.
no.
nothing. just sit. i'll be back. well it's been two hours. how do you feel?
has the whole world gone insane?
oh yeah?! how long since you've had a baby?
that is a very immature attitude, young man.
c'mon, bart. be a sport and kill blitzen, okay?
what the -- ? bart, look! it's santa claus!
your mother's right, bart. sure, you're the one who ruined all of sideshow bob's criminal schemes --
yeah! you do your own dirty work!
militants, huh? well, if i were you, i'd kick their asses.
can you see the pie stains?
look, marge! a restaurant owned by celebrities! i always wanted to be a celebrity!
oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. what about that freezer lady in georgia?
maybe i do, chief. maybe i do... c'mon, boy, think of a plan.
going bowling. not back - avenge deaths.
it is silly, marge. and look at all the money i'm making!
but i can't be out of beer. i'm the beer baron!
hey, banner, how's it hangin'?
well, i don't think so. you don't even have a trigger on that thing.
you forgot one thing, wiggum.

when? when? ich bin hungrig!
wow, i gotta start going to church.
who?

the bad dog or the good dog?
now i can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
you mean maggie?
two in a row!
in that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. lousy god.
wh... what's going on? wh... wha... why am i on a japanese box? oh, my god, what is that?...
thank you. may i please use your phone?
ow!
konichi-wa.
yes.
oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.
oh. a five thirteen. i'll handle it. that got it.
okay. do i have to do anything?
no, no. he doesn't know he's coming to dinner. i didn't think he'd come, so i called and said i had something really important to tell him and that i could only tell him about it here. it's him! it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...
i 'unno. don't ask me how the economy works.
what are you saying?
i'll do it. to professionalism!
you wish.
call me when you get a karaoke machine.
but, marge...!
well, that's all the time we have. so this is the simpson family saying: "as you walk down the road of life..."
they sure are.
well, bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?
shut up! it's my car, and i say we're going to the lost city of gold!
oh, i don't want to go to new york city.
marge, i can't feel my legs! i can't feel my legs!
aw, shoot. all right, all right. give me one bowl.
the boss says you're fired.
ooh, a fresh batch of america balls! mmm...
and why is marge here?
all right, all right. so, he's a fraud. i don't care! his mom doesn't care! do any of you care?
watching shows like gentle ben... mister, we could use a man like sheriff lobo again. disco duck and fleetwood mac...
don't worry, son. if that bothers you, i'll destroy something maggie loves.
bart was feeling mighty blue...
and we never did.
get the hell out.
hm.
ah so.
unless what?
all right, all right, i promise. there must be another way to get an air conditioner... mmmm... re-circulated air.
yeah. "to lisa. never forget your daddy loves ."
i learned from the master.
fine, then don't use it.
you want me? come and get me!!
he's crazy.
bart, are you in there? have you forgotten our little "kablamo" talk?
okay, okay. it's your sugar, bart.
that sounds like witch talk to me, lisa.
i don't know.
oh, but i want to do some rioting.
let's get that! the suffocation thing!
oh, yeah.
oh, i don't need anything like that - yet. just gimme my gun.
yuh.
only if you clean your room.
pull!
sure thing, honey. you want me to get the cat down?
all right, marge. i'll do it. for you.
so this is the thanks i get for protecting my family? then go! i'll be just fine! do you know how to cook dinner?
marge? sorry. marge? oh, sorry. marge?
freeze, bad guy!
now wait a second. you doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
yeah, well... he's wearing that hat like an idiot.
yes. mr. koufax, don't you think flanders is a big jerk? y'ello? y'ello? yeah, homer again. i think we got cut off. y'ello?
me? but you were doing such a great job.
do it.
not any more. from now on, you're my main man. okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. oh, rod, you don't have to. you're cut.
great debut, son. you really settled in after some early jitters.
come on, guys. we can't play without bart. he's the heart of this team!
well, if quitting is the best, maybe i should just quit my job.
i'm feelin' kinda low, apu. you got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? you know, "skittlebrau"?
oh no, my quarterback. what are we gonna do?
whoa...
tell her the truth. you're not ready to get married.
you dog.
it's you.
you're already in a home.
damn right. mmm. who knew that lay's made liquid potato chips? i can't suck just one.
lied to his mother.
c'mon. you shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this. you should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. and i know just the place. ahh. is this the life, or what?
come on, elephant. put me down! hey, everyone seems upside down.
i didn't like it. the mast had termites.
so long, suckers!
hey, i'm trying to eat here. beat it, pegleg!
pfft! facts are meaningless. you can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. facts shmacts.
look! a message! "the end will come at sundown." heh heh heh heh. hey, wait a second. i don't like the sound of that.
it is?
open a window.
oh, yeah. you've gotta be careful when you do a trick like this....
nothin' but.
what about me? you didn't thank me.
come on! it'll be fun!
yeah, me too. let me know if you need any help.
...going...
oh, you will, honey. you will.
can - we - skip - church?
yeah, you're right, moe. you're always moe.
oh, marge, i don't wanna hear any more about that silver polish.
outta my way, snow-poke!
i'm gonna kill you! / no, i'm killing him first! / why you little... bart, the next time you ever have... / you went too far...
oh great, now we have to send him a card.
hey, she's getting away with the washcloth!
with blood, i bet!
no i don't, i think they're bad / they're fake and phoney and totally wrong.
i knew i should've shut that window.
sor-reee, your majesty.
obviously, i don't. now if you'll get out of my way...
sorry, son. daddy failed.
oh-ho, put down your stick. we're here to work.
oh. bart?
ah, yes. how do we handle refunds?
i understand.
well, ain't that somethin'.
now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh marge?
it took me years to forge that groove.
that's right.
this, bart, is a crazy man.
uh huh. and how much does it cost?
so, i beat the system.
will there be beer?
now wait a minute, moe --
oh, my mistake.
all i had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor.
hah, why even unpack?
but marge, we're not mass married.
but i want to go.
woo hoo!
scratch, eh?
can't discuss that now, marge. i have to write another delicious memo. mmm... memo.
you don't look so rich.
well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him.
now that's a fight i wanna be a part of.
woop, sorry son. i didn't know you, jay leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown.
woo! tv! yeah!
i hope he tells us to burn our pants. these things are drivin' me nuts!
hi sweetie. i'm off to moe's. love ya.
relax. all i smell is garlic and fish.
maa-rrge...
oh, you did. but -- i still don't know... i can just imagine what marge would say.
you're a genius, moe. all your troubles will soon be over for a couple months.
whoa! hang on a minute! the guard said i have visitors coming!
moe! oh, moe, thank god you're here!
hurry up, moe, for the love of god! hurry up!
i... also sleep... g'night, mommy...
oh, forget it!
hey, yeah.
if i were her, i'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake.
oh. but... you run it, right?
you get it after you leave. now get out of here.
what'd he say? what about my car?
"do the message! da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da."
gentlemen, there's only one solution. we place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big.
you know lisa, i've taken a lot from this country. maybe it's time i gave something back.
but i'm not a h--
aw, that's sweet, honey. i'll bring you back a hat.
i like you.
you know marge, joining the reserves was the best thing i ever did. i feel good about myself, i'm helping my country, and later, i'm gonna get gilligan's autograph.
no!
uh, is the poopdeck really what i think it is?
with a knife.
fire the torpedoes!
yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way.
bart!
you can't spell "dishonorable" without "honorable."
no.
i have a to do pile? marge, how many kids do we have? oh, no time to count, i'll just estimate. uh, nine.
no, sir. i'm really sorry sir. an older boy told me to do it.
not spy, squeal. i've got no choice.
maybe. but first i need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
why do you keep picking on me? marge's name was on that tax return, too.
uh, i'm homer simpson, your trusted employee.
uhmmmm... errr... uhhhhh...
hey, that guy looks like you.
we'll hide out at my place. i've got beer.
i call president!
helper monkey, eh?
mind if i take him for a ride?
marge, can i get a duck?
they didn't have lord huggington?
nuh-uh. it isn't filled until it's spilled.
i never apologize, lisa. i'm sorry, but that's just the way i am. siddown, honey. the men will clear the table! so long, chicken bone.
that's not the way she tells it. uh, it's like the measles. good to get it out of the way.
but this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. and i'm going to get it back. lisa, do i have my pants on?
you'll never silence me! i'm the last angry man, patterson! a crusader for the little guy!
what am i, the answer man? just vote for me.
that's a good question, bono. 'cause i'd be the most wack, tripped-out sanitation commissioner ever! can ya dig it?
uh, okay, it's excellent. but aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?
who should handle all your dirty jobs?
what-what-what. what button? where am i? who took my false teeth?
see? we're still friends. c'mon, give us a cuddle. jean-paul, how are the new uniforms? do they match the suede boots? beautiful. did you get the new trucks? are they amphibious? well, there's only one way to find out. we can always buy more.
wait, shutup... i just thought of something!
uh, nothin'. now, uh, you were saying how great i was...?
yeah, but can he do this?
sorry, son, daddy's down for the day. why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?
time out... t... time out...
hey, these power sauce bars look pretty healthy.
heh, heh, heh. go ahead. try and grab some flab. go on. ju-- no, not there. not there either. over here.
sorry, i only eat food in bar form. when you concentrate food, you unleash its awesome power, i'm told. that's why i'm compressing five pounds of spaghetti into one handy mouth-sized bar. hm. hospital, please.
you? did?
so nobody believes i can do this, huh? well, my son does. and i'm not gonna let him down. i'm going to climb this entire mountain on my own.
why don't you tell me, son? see any interesting flags up there?
who is this?
atta girl. i love you, sweet --
uh, yes sir, mr. burns, sir.
oh, lisa, thank god you're okay! ow! ow! ow! oww!
feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? that's what my heart's doing all the time. bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?
uh... not this exquisite.
yeah... but it'll always live on, because we'll never forget it.
but marge, the gilded truffle is an intimate, elegant place.
yeah. seems like the thing to do. so, you gonna...
no, no. don't do that.
g'night. hmm, that's queer.
shhh. we're trespassing. and some of these farmers have pitchforks.
if there's anything more exquisite than queen anne's lace, i haven't found it.
they didn't hear us in the sewing room.
it hasn't changed since that magical evening when i knocked you up.
y'know, all this danger is kind of a turn--
thank you...
can't you just write on your arm like i do?
looks like he's about ready for another squeezin'.
woo hoo!
uh-uh, think. is that what alex would say?
hey, that's my shovel.
bringin' up the rear.
ow! stop pummeling me! it's really painful!
no, i don't deserve sugar. i'm halfway to my grave, and i haven't accomplished anything. oh, i am not looking forward to my funeral.
oh, all right. maybe i can pinpoint where my life went wrong.
no one man can do all that. you're a liar, honey. a dirty, rotten liar.
no, not this one. "the smugglers of pirate cove." it's about pirates.
ohh, that's where you're wrong, marge. he was a shameless self-promoter.
what? eh. eh. let me handle the creative end of this, marge. you don't understand how the creative mind works like i do.
okay.
you mean like an electric blanketmobile?
eh. oh. okay, this time try to keep your nostrils closed. oh, look what you did. now i have to get my cold cream gun.
what?
i did it! i'm gonna be rich! look, mr. edison, i did it. i'm an inventor! and i owe it all to you. see? it's just a regular chair, but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your... awdammit!
taking-bart-across-state-lines-back-soon. i borrowed your wallet!
no, but we'll stop off at the da vinci museum on the way home...
i needed my power fix.
well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. where's bart?
all right, young lady. i want you to march yourself directly to the kwik-e-mart and get me some chips and a beer.
really? well, the time just flew by, didn't it?
this is legal, right?
shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. i'm gonna, like, totally waste you.
daddy would like a word with you, barty!
going where?
wait, mine came back. i know how to cheer you up. this little piggy went to kwik-e-mart, this little piggy went nuts, this little piggy went surfing, and this little piggy went-- ooh!
well, we can't compete with that, but--
i promise you kids lots of things. that's what makes me such a good father.
mmmm. ugh, pesticides! carbomate, if i'm not mistaken. yep, carbomate.
ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me. life jackets?
faster, marge! faster! the snapping turtles are massing! heads up. comin' through. look out! hey, volley ball. can i play later? hi, apu.
ohhh my god, i am such a huge, huge fan of yours, miss basinger.
oh, why didn't you move to, sayyy... bethesda?
absolutely. if you promise to keep mine.
porcini --
ron howard?!
i'll do that! you go upstairs and have a beer.
the important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. either one of you. it's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. ron howard's attached to direct.
well, if alec is out, i'm out too. you're on your own, potsie.
unbelievable?
but where will i bask?
our dog isn't famous. and you kids aren't exactly john and joan cusack. and you. you couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. i'm about ready to ankle this family.
oh, yeah? what have they ever done for you? when was the last time barbra streisand cleaned out your garage? and when it's time to do the dishes, where's ray bolger? i'll tell ya. ray bolger is lookin' out for ray bolger!
okay, i'll stop.
slow down, fellas. i've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future.
pretty good, huh?
you know... i have no idea. hey, dad. what does the "j" stand for?
wow, look at this place. there's a pond for skinny dippin', a tire for skinny swingin'... i can actually feel the good vibrations. oww... ch.
i'll treasure this poncho forever.
no way, narc. bodily functions are a natural thing.
that was cool. think i'll stick around. we've got everything we need right here. good times, sunshine, free love...
a saturn?
what's in your brand new bag, mama?
i'm sensing some negative vibes here. but i promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
that's it! somehow!
seth, munchie, they can destroy our bodies and our ponchos, but they can never silence our song of protest. "uptown girl / she's been living in her white-bread world..." come on, guys... uptown girl...
hang in there, son. i'm taking us out for our traditional sunday brunch. he zinged you, marge.
i'm way ahead of you.
uh...
what's your problem, veggie? you don't even eat lobster.
yeah... pinchy?... pinchy?!... oh... pinchy!!!
it's because they're stupid, that's why. that's why everybody does everything.
let's see. one, two, three... six whiskeys!
f. murray abraham.
yep, that's what happens when you get older. it's one of those natural things. beautiful in its way.
i said "fine." what is it about the word "sure" you don't understand?
really? you think it's dangerous?
well, actually i-- hey! quit harvesting me with your eyes!
that's my girl.
oh, i like taffy, but i don't deserve taffy.
h-heyy, let me off this thing.
oh, i wish i had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. well, i guess it's up to me to take the first step.
you butchers! give it back! gimme that! gim--
you stupid nerds! he's trying to save you money on long distance!
well, it's all-- hey, i thought you twisted your ankle.
nooo!
they'll be fine in half an hour.
oooh, mini-cannoli! hey! i called that! i saw it first! come back here! milking room? i hope you cows are decent. oh! crap on a crutch! they're milking rats! milk-ing rats!
a-- wait a second. i'm not saving you unless you promise to get that rats' milk out of the schools.
it's my duty, marge. besides, those mobsters don't scare me. bart, would you go start daddy's car?
why do you talk that way?
that guy with the knife sure can dance, huh?
ohh, i'd say you were luminous, magnetic, incandescent.
don rickles zinged you, marge.
wuss rock?
that's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. how, you ask? with a phony senior discount card!
all right, bart! fire in the hole! okay, no more gasoline.
let's do it.
congratulations! welcome to the homer simpson program.
sucker.
yeah, yeah, yeah, i'll figure it out. this isn't rocket science.
way to go, flanders. the bible's finally pulling its weight. got any more holy numbers?
whuh?
eeech. okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. okay, you're saying that ned and me married you two?
we are so dead.
blame me if you must, but don't ever speak ill of the program. the program is rock solid. the program is sound.
but amber, i can change!
boooo!
"hitler is a jerk, mussolini..."
oh, it's a great team, kent... never gave up hope... i want to thank jesus... and say hi to my special lady marge... we did it, baby! wooooo! woooooo!
touchdown!
that was cold-blooded, marge.
okay, whatever takes my mind off my life.
speak for yourself! bart, get down here! i'm gonna spank you back to the stone age!
yeah, but there's two!
no.
stem lube. even i didn't fall for that... although winter is coming...
me?!
oh, c'mon!...
what is it, rudy?
scalping tickets to the super bowl. have you no shame, sir? i should give you a royal caning.
okay, moe. i believe you had me by the throat. reverend lovejoy was working the body...
man, that's gonna be some show.
hey, howyadoin'?
what one?
gee... i never thought i'd say this about a tv show, but this is kinda stupid. hey, "policecops." that sounds like a lethal combination.
y'ello... yes, this is the original homer simpson. who's this?... the debbie pinson who was the homecoming queen at high school?... yes, i'm still available.
take it or leave it... carl.
i wish i hadn't bought a hundred of these.
okay.
who's jeremy piven?
any of these will be fine.
nobody snuggles with max power. you strap yourself in and feel the g's.
max power doesn't abbreviate. each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. maybe more important. no, as important.
yeah, but i usually have three or four.
no way, this guy's a winner. he has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... anyway, you wouldn't understand.
and i counted the pennies in the ashtray.
well, i spend a lot of time on the couch...
somebody buy this guy a tree so he'll shut up.
tree-huggers...
so, trent, where's the party bus headed now? what?
fine. hooty mcboob it is.
oh, don't make me choose.
hey, they stole our idea! see, look!
gimme that!
don't worry, honey. i got something really special planned for valentine's day.
we've gotta stop that traitor apu.
not entirely.
how the hell should i know? just get in this cage.
ow! prickers! owwww!
i saw krabappel's butt. i paid.
and that's it, right?
shut up! screw you guys!
well, that's a turn-off.
you throw your peanuts!
i'd like to read the following statement, but i do so under my own free will. it has come to my attention that nbc sucks. i apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many fox shows as possible. so in summary, nbc bad, fox good. cbs great.
that's no way to address sir drinks-a-lot.
they know i'm kidding. okay, bart, it's your turn to pick. where are we headed? bowling? demolition derby? p.j. o'harrigans? isn't that a funny name? huh? huh?
what? and marmaduke doesn't?
who's fonzie?! don't they teach you anything in school? he freed the squares.
so we're even then?
wha?! i heard a yell. did you touch a wire?
that's right, "the odd couple." so meet your comically mismatched roommate, bart simpson.
hey, that looks like fun.
oooh, here's something you'd like. "when animals attack magicians."
well, that's a relief.
i'm sorry, lisa. oh, it's not your fault. i know we love each other, dad, but we're two very different people. and, much as i hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart. oh lisa, honey, i won't ever let that happen.
let's try some oil of lorenzo. and, uh, what's keeping joan rivers alive?
i told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. bom-bom-bom-bom... i told the witch doctor he had to run a test... hi sweetie.
well, i really gave him no choice. y'see...
oh yeah? what do you know about it? y-- it's you! you're him! you're tony randall!
my hat's off to you, red. you're a true american hero. and you did it with style and dignity and... hey, you're not breathing. don't people usually breathe?
ah, touché. bye, marge! aren't you gonna say bye?
yeah... the open road. that little punk. i'll teach him some manners.
great. i'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. and then when the paperwork is done, i'll make gwenn my wife.
sold!
wow! you guys are even lazier than me! well, don't worry. i'll keep your secret.
i'm keeping a promise to an american roadmaster.
well, son. i guess it's time to go home.
heads up!
no problem, lord. and it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if i had a few extra wives.
uh, um, uh... i think we should see other people?
c'mon, eve. hurry!
i never used those pizza coupons.
but, marge, i'm not like other men. that's why you buy my pants at that special store.
no, no, i'm into chicken.
well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here.
uh... all right! just go ahead and sue me. everybody else does! the average settlement is $68,000.
so you'd better catch the fever. catch it...
i think i remember my own life, marge. astrid said the key to my art is anger. but you know me, i'm mister mellow. so i'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. c'mon, gimme what you got.
wow. it's like marge's dream come true... for me! isn't that great, marge?! for me!
now you're making sense. good night.
you can call him ray / or you can call him j. / or you can call him ray j. / but you doesn't have to call him...
no, these guys are geniuses. i could never think of something like soup or a pencil. i'm just gonna rest for a minute. what the?! who the?! hey!
why'd he do that?
that's for the courts to decide, son.
and is that us on the roof?
god bless america!
lucky stiff. i'm working my ass off here. good steak, honey.
now if you want to be the life of the party like lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item.
"d" it up, marge. i'm goin' to the hole.
could we, marge? could we get a horse?
i do!
oh, arthur fortune!
good thing those lesbians knew cpr.
good. good. one more.
come on, nessie. one more pull.
look, i got runner-up prize.
uh... geraldo... simpson.
up-bup-bup-bup.
houston, we have a problem. a sexy problem.
larry flynt is right! you guys stink!
yes, i did.
ahh! undo! undo! uhh.
i know, sir. i'm sorry, sir. it's just that you and maude live like royalty in your fancy castle, while i got marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive.
there's only three left in the world!
a little late for "could've's," marge.
what? the guy who washes the elephants is japanese. his name is takashi. he's in my book club.
oh, all right.
it's worth every cent. i'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
yeah, and i'm clobbersaurus.
shimatta baka-me!
could someone please whack my hernia back in?
well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock.
but i like the nice things you said about me.
we didn't? that's odd. seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
hmmm, i'm not certain about lenny.
well, that was a stinker.
listen, gibson, i'm tired of hollywood pretty boys like you and jack valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. you see this? it symbolizes that she's my property and i own her.
guilty as charged.
yeah, but...
piece o' cake. now where's that kid with my latte?
yeah, guys like me.
sorry i asked. oh, crap! here they come!
they are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family. no offense.
i think so. no.
okay, mr. difficult. how about a teen sex romp where you and your buddies are always trying to get some? no, wait. a ghost who wins the lottery! you could be the ghost or the lottery commissioner. ooh, what about indiana jones? does anyone own the rights to that? hey, mel. i fell out.
candy bar?
sure you do. all your favorite stars have used drugs: brett butler.... tim allen...
way to guilt him, marge!
well, if you want one, they sell 'em at...
marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband.
hey, you found my needlenose pliers.
i'm on top of it.
who cares? that man can really slug.
if he's so smart, how come he's dead?
sorry.
it was so hard to get to 500 words...
we make a good team. a groin-grabbingly good team!
marge, shh! it's important that no one know that i'm a food critic.
and the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
and the cosby mysteries! that show had limitless possibilities!
oh, that's classic.
well, i hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. hm, i seem to be missing a piece of my ear. touché!
people will think what i tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
really? like what?
eh, i've had a good run.
but it was worth it to get back our super sugar crisp cereal. can't get enough of that sugar crisp...
relax, i'm fine. but when i do die, i don't want any autopsies.
we'll miss you, buddy.
he's undead, all right.
doin' what now?
i'm caught on something!
i can still hear his voice on the wind.
good-bye lisa, remember me as i am... filled with murderous rage.
the sun? that's the hottest place on earth!
to the top please. swim, my pretties.
heavyset? what's that supposed to mean?
huh?
and somebody wanted to get rid of it in april.
come on, carter, build us a house, you lazy bum.
race ya to the swimmin' hole! com'on, maw. bring the young 'uns! there's no leeches! lots of snakes, though.
go get lassie.
oh, that's just superstition. you watch me. i'll grow something out there.
leave me alone, you big bully.
from the producers of "waiting to exhale."
oh, you're right. this farm's hopeless. why didn't i listen to those inbred hicks? i guess i'll just go hang myself in the barn.
addictive, eh?
okay.
i know, honey. but what can i do, as an individual? i wouldn't know where to begin.
i don't know why we ever left in the first place.
oh, i'm twenty-six hours late for work. no time for maggie. oooh, where's waldo? nope. nope. this would be a lot easier without all these people. nope. nope. it's there-- uh, nope.
okay.
what a rotten day!
in your face, to-do list!
well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do i read from the sheet labeled "jokes" or "answers?"
i'm doing a walk-on. it's a show business thing. so how y'all doin'? let's see... what's in the news today?
but she said i...
save your tears, moe. save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope.
that's it! kids are the answer! i'll dedicate my life to my children.
then don't.
pay up, marge.
so, how's the tribe comin' along? any papooses?
my mistake. stay in the moment.
i've been waiting so long to hear that.
marge... they've turned into jerks.
what an age we live in.
oh, no. you're not gettin' me on that dance floor. don't try and make me. if i have to get a divorce i will.
a gang! that's the answer.
this gang's for rebels, flanders, not conformos.
and what if we don't, pops?
sorry. done.
you're done. next!
i just don't want to be alone.
never! it was a gift from newsweek!
hey, why is this door locked?
forget it. he releases the hounds on every charity that comes to his door: feed the children, save the whales, even release the hounds.
please, mr. coleman. we can explain.
get her! she's doing something!
woo hoo!
stupid sexy flanders! ow, my legs! this is the worst pain ever...
gotcha! gotcha! / i'll show you!
oh, it's a great hat. no one's questioning the hat.
it's the bread of astronauts.
sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? he hit her again.
help us, virtual doc! look at me! i'm on my knees!
oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! you wonderful man!
howdy. and thanks for not recoiling in horror.
come on, loosen up. this is paradise.
my old roommates, the nerds. ya workin'?
have you nerds forgotten everything i taught you? this calls for a prank. i see a bucket...
what? i can see fine. that had nothing to do with the bucket.
look at moe dance! aloha moe...
yeah.
oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, marge?
oh, i only wanted to show my school spirit.
poor guy. he lost his leg.
i mean an award that's worth winning.
and the bed never needs to be made. check it out.
oops, forgot to swirl it.
geez, way to burst my bubble, marge.
huh? if you can't sell beer, what are lenny and carl doing here?
woo hoo! propellers... spinning! turn... left! boat go... there!
pirates! are you friendly pirates?
i don't wanna!
they're the greatest heroes of all. hey, something's clawing at my leg. okay, it stopped.
i.d.? man, charlie didn't ask for i.d. when i fought at la choy and chun king. i saw my best friend's head explode at margaret cho.
no talking! no new crap! "takin' care of business!" now!
look, lisa. it glows. oooo.
pearls, eh?
good horse. here's one taco and you'll get another when you win. hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?
possessions are fleeting.
and what if i refuse to lose?
go, son! do it for the normals!
bees!
flanders? since when do you like anything cool?
that's a damn lie, and you know it! gimme a shirt!
finally.
i know, i know. it's never easy.
easy answer, eh?
well, that's all gonna change, thanks to this tape...
so if you're tired of dating the same old losers...
oh, wake up, ned. you think maude isn't dating in heaven?
i toileth not on ye sabbath, woman! a pox on thee.
you're mad? where's my show!?
oh, why did i register with insta-trace?
maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in springfield are simple folk. we like our cars fast, and our banks closed. okay, fine, we'll go down there. but they're not going to be open.
mm-hmm.
great, but why am i on a plane?
done.
no, i'm good. hey, what happened to all the shirtless girls you see in all the geographical magazines?
you don't have tv? but what will i watch while i'm sitting on the couch?
really? without tv, it's hard to know when one day begins and the other ends.
well, i'm not not licking toads... well, it's time to get to work. humanitarian homer simpson, over and out.
hey, that's great. now let's get to work! now, if "the flintstones" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement. come on little friend, make a wisecrack. you know, "it's a living," that sort of thing. oopsie.
because you're all terrible sinners.
twist off, dammit!
moe, the new duff calendars are out! the ones with your picture!
yeah, but just for a minute. it's a funny story; i'll tell you sometime.
whatever.
i know what you mean. our dog had that.
i am an angel from the future.
yeah, you were...
sure we can't talk you into it?
oh, i'm tired of giving you money. why can't you be more like lisa?
then what is his ghost protecting?
ah, crap!
hey, vinnie, how's about a pizza? i got-a no job.
marge, you're making a complete fool of yourse... oh, it's just barney.
oh. my name is homer and i'm planning a trip to st. louis.
but that's barney's seat. are you tryin' to make me the new barney?
wasted? what about our staring contests? and the way we always knew what football coaches should've done? remember the day we jumped that census guy and stole his clicker?
but you've got me. who have i got?
that i will.
okay.
barney, no! don't!
get off! get off!
it's not bad.
quizmaster, yes... that would entertain me briefly.
okay, non-smoker... add eight years. so according to this i'll live to be... 42! oh, that's horrible! i won't even live to see my children die!
you see? gibberish. all gibberish.
i see...
wooo! i like mu-sic!
biatch? moi?
look out for what?
there's no good place!
yeah, but first i talked to the engineer. he said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature.
but i was just...
okay, but i ain't payin' for two weddin's.
fine. there are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.
too late.
much better.
oh, here we go with the add ons. no thanks.
oh! what's that awful sound?
what are you talking about, professor frink? they're clearly in the "on" position. see? "on."
ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
remember that talk we had about you not wrecking people's weddings?
run, marge, run! pump those crazy legs!
thank you.
"my funny family," take one. aannnd action! honey, i'm home! the boss is coming to dinner and i need a clean shirt.
...m-e-r. okay.
and that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.
who told you about those laws? was it marge?
who are you! i'll get you!
what?! what's she doing here?
... and you may get a compliment from an attractive co-worker! lenny?
well, the thing about that is...
oh no!
here's a better idea -- i know how we can replace those children.
intelligent italians? something's wrong.
c'mon lads! let's drive them back to the ocean!
what am i, a tailor?
not a single word of warning.
uh, i have a question, phoney.
well, i... nice wiring, bart.
i reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job.
no problem.
oh yeah? they think they're better than us, huh? bart, c'mere a minute.
you're right. we've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.
i can't believe those traitors abandoned us. they couldn't take one lousy famine.
wow, the who! woo! rock 'n' roll!
but those olde springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like keith partridge.
we'll talk.
yeah, we're heroes... but where's our parade?
uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room.
fine, i'll just discuss heavenly matters. so, how's maude flanders doin' up there? she playin' the field? ooh... yeah, really? all those guys? amen.
my uncle still has my nose.
marge, may i play devil's advocate for a moment?
i think we're in the clear.
take that, lisa's beliefs.
well, moping won't make it better.
oh, must hide lisa...! come i-in!
well, what do you want, a medal?
can we go now?
get him, sheeba! i'm on board.
but how do i get it?
well, sir... you see, sir... i've worked here a long time, and my wife has a game leg, and my kids have game things as well...
i liked when i threw the pudding.
uh, no thanks. i'll just eat it here.
anti-polio.
huh? help! mr. burns!
maybe for you. how come you didn't rescue me?
i retract my statement.
you're right. it's time to rebuild my self-esteem. hey, what happened to...?
what? lemme see that.
what's an e-mail?
i just need something to receive e-mail.
good start! now finish the job!
hey!
i can't. my web page hasn't gotten a single hit. come on.
beautiful. we have confirmation.
what a bombshell!
hey, moe, can you keep a secret?
nooo! i'm mr. x! gimme! gimme!
that's a great idea! i'll make up some news!
so i'm a prisoner? how come?
wow. so, who brought us here?
but why?
huh?
absolutely.
he's very good.
come on, pony up, flanders. the kid's not turning tricks for nothin'.
i told you! i find them boring.
well, yeah. but god conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs.
i could ask you the very same question.
well, you're the mark. ... of integrity.
oh, he's not for sale.
well, before she died, she ordered this bible especially for you.
let's dust a few fossils.
so we're under arrest for fraud?
yeah. ya big idiot...
uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly.
'course he did, son. he's a filthy crook. now, let's all hit the hay. i guess you haven't heard of chloroform.
stop! this has gone on just long enough. nobody carjacked me. i tried to pull a con and got conned myself. and then i lied to you all! so did bart.
heh, heh, heh. tremendous.
oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement.
i 'unno... internet?
yeah, as a tribute to princess di. and dodi. because these days, princesses...
do you have airbags?
pick me! pick me!
uh yes, i see that it's in bill form. excellent.
sorry. our ticket out of this hellhole.
yeah, but aren't those experiments dangerous?
there's a crayon in my brain?! but i've had thousands of head x-rays. how come no one ever noticed it before?
and they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too.
get out!
you see? it's cool to be smart. so be like me, and use your minds: paint a painting, sing a song, and dance a dance!
effigy, eh? yeah, nothing burns like an effigy. hey, that's me! stop that! the fire inspector would be appalled.
i don't understand. that wasn't funny.
oh, that would be heaven! moe szyslak?!
who wants lottery tickets?
did you say "smockron"?
that's not gonna do it, marge. you need something red. hey, toro! here's something to gore!
and his fondness for the guitar.
my back!
hey, it feels a little better.
and as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains. patent pending... patent pending... patent pending... hey, who's this guy?
not unless you think about the irony.
nooo! my spine-o-cylinder! they'll pay for what they did to my can.
don't worry your spiky little head. i've got it all planned out.
i love the theater.
get that one! faster! you got half time for the other ones. oh, good. oh no, that one's slowing up! oh, good. oh, that one's wobbling! oh, up... you got that before i even said it.
ah, geez. how come they never call traveling anymore?
we're gonna go with the wolves.
yes! that's what i wanted! and finally, make sure the net is tight and springy. that seems about right.
hey, this was a lot of fun, guys.
come on, marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: john rocker, o.j. simpson, dorf...
uh-oh.
with that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament.
yes, darling?
i don't care about b.c., i care about m.e. my enjoyment.
this session's under.
hey, leave my teammate alone!
did you hear that? she said we're goin' down!
hm, you seem less disgusted. let's go!
my tennis stick! who are you?
oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
stay out of this, lisa. marge, i've made up my mind. i'll do your job for a day, and you do mine. then we'll see who has it tougher.
how many lives must you ruin?
yeah, that's the look.
but... the tv gave me the impression that...
welcome to real life, lisa. you can't fight city hall, aka blockoland. so don't even try.
hey, any friend of marge is a friend of mine.
please, ugly is such a smelly word. who would you rather go out with?
oh, really... boy, you weren't kidding. your profit margins are razor-thin.
oh. well, is that it?
okay. so, uh, you wanna go get something to eat?
wait a minute. will this erase my memory?
i don't mind being called a liar when i'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. but not when i'm telling the truth.
don't worry. duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
i'm soooo hungry.
what's happening? did i crush your corporation?
the truth never tasted so good!
i got it!
three dollars? that doesn't seem so bad.
reach into these holes. i use a carrot.
canceled.
just to get some attention.
my doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that...
no, i can handle it. i'll get you, squealer.
africa? they're bound to have food there!
just like jimmy carter.
now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born.
good ol' kitenge. quick! into the river! hippos hate water.
it's a flower.
and not just monkey feces either.
look at me, i'm a scientist!
no, lisa, but i sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast.
homer wants a brownie! i'm gonna get one!
reattach a thumb? this isn't "gattaca."
but i have finger insurance!
thanks a lot. now i gotta walk to shelbyville.
did you ever see that "blue man group?"
leave ned alone.
ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime.
yeah, a lifetime of memories.
ahh... is that a fact? and you think you know someone.
she's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? can they do that?
don't say that, ned!
christ be with you.
yes! losers! lo-sers! lo-sers! l-- you said "homer," right?
mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory. i don't know, i'm still a little hazy. oh, yeah. now i remember it like it was yesterday...
but "dr. screwlittle" sounded like a delightful romp. well, you don't have to worry about the bill. we've never welshed on a... look, a bear! run!
well, marge isn't here. she had to identify a body at the morgue.
yeah, well. how was the concert?
it's just a legal thing, to protect me.
i owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it.
don't worry honey, you'll have children of your own someday. then you'll know my joy.
sorry. daddy thought you were a pile of cable.
i'll call.
uh... for frosty chocolate milkshakes. frosty chocolate milkshakes!
the simpsons are going to delaware!
oh, this'll be good.
big deal.
wait, this is just a shaved puppy.
what-ever.
good idea, mr. ed. wanna come along, noodle neck?
she's not the boss of me.
what's my blood alcohol?
yep. man one, machine zero. how do you like that score?
hey, we stayed for your kids!
what'd she say about cupcakes?
it won't?
i'll medicate you... ...honey. you know, this could be fun. race you to the kitchen, my little tether ball.
i'm with you, son!
ow, my head... oh. i need a beer.
yeah, they're italian.
no!
but...
why you little...
your honor, i'd like to be tried separately.
hey, marge, surf's up!
she lives in a houseboat? wow, she is so cool.
oh lord, guide this cinder block...
just the radio, dear.
so, i guess you wouldn't mind if i was to dig a hole of my own.
geez moe, you've been a real crank lately.
ooh, ooh, pick me!
for what? a little splattered food never hurt anybody. now everybody shut up and dance!
you dirty teen.
there you go, doll. look, buddy, i don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here.
um... the rabbits are cute.
moe, we want our bar back.
but when i'm passionate about something, i see it through to the end.
she's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. hee, hee.
lemons...
got that cat right in the leg.
and i'm thankful i get to spend thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender.
these fortunes are terrible. they're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness.
yes, mr. burns.
burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go.
no problem.
oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!
um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?
you mean a van dyke?
i don't know. but i was quite moved by your letter. i'd love to meet you and your family. shall we say dinner?
why look, it's chad sexington!
do me! do me! i am in your power. boss me around.
huh?... there have been so many classic simpson moments. i remember that time i tried to jump over springfield gorge...
oh, hey, you guys can come with us.
and someone has eaten the flesh.
did you really make that envelope? 'cause it says hammermill over here.
the word "unblowupable" is thrown around a lot these days, but i think i can say with confidence... okay, that shows you what could potentially happen. what was that?
don't worry, i planned for this.
got it. how was that?
bag's in the kitchen.
new shooter.
police brutality! and chew-tality!
don't blame me, blame tinseltown and its second golden age. may it never end.
gimme that beer!
no! i will never... oh wait, it's blatz. hey, they're all right.
it's okay. we're married.
use both hands...
well, that's the last we'll see of them. come on, we're goin' to moe's.
okay. oh my god! wow. now that's a goiter.
that's a great idea. do you think i could run a mile in three and a half minutes?
okay.
why you little!
well, well. if it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage.
well, good work, blue-hair 'n' brocko-witch. okay, that was mine.
eww. i touched it. over.
remember what i told you about running away from your troubles?
look at those abs. everyone here has a six pack and i'm the only one with a keg.
mm hmm.
krackle was my favorite.
i'm gonna kill you!
marge? marge is gone! but at least the demolition derby form is... what?! nooo!
that's okay, marge, you're a good wet blanket. the kind i like wrapped around me.
spill it, moneybags.
yeah, i... honey, did you get any sleep? oh, i'm so sorry.
oh no. if marge marries artie, i'll never be born!
what did carl think?
woo hoo!
but knowing about it would make you want to go here.
go gamecocks!
de-fense! de-fense! de-fense! ouch! i sat on something sharp!
doesn't matter. they have free health care.
oh, right.
it's just not fair. this buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food...
i've seen fancier.
stop saying that.
you don't need that.
who told you?!
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. we'll call you. or send you some fruit.
well, you brought me into this world, so no.
no you can't. you're slow to react, dad.
turn that down! you call that music? i-- i just don't know what to do.
we've gotta go after them.
i decide who reads and when. how 'bout now? hm, "homer's odyssey." is this about that mini-van i rented once?
if i'm laughing at what i think i am, it's very funny. anyway... "as night fell, the greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."
mmm! that's the next best thing to eating lenny. i'm still hungry.
oh, i'm sorry i was gone so long. but i'm gonna do something i haven't done for twenty years -- take out the trash. sweet penelope, you're just as beautiful as you were when i left.
our next story is "hamlet," by william shakespeare.
i'm pretty sure it wasn't.
fine, i'll cut off your ponytail.
get me tools and beer.
oh, that poor little boy. we've got to find him. how many people live in brazil?
so it's opposite land. crooks chase cops, cats have puppies...
way ahead of you, marge. take me to the hotel / my hands are on a guy's ass / boy this dude must work out...
there he is! it-- oh wait, you said brown hair, right?
we'll do our best, honey. now let's get goin'. check please.
taxi!
this corn doesn't look so big.
we'll get to that. right now, i think we need some time apart--
i had a bad experience with drugs...
marge, i just realized: i am the "ow" in the word "now". and if you tell anyone...
oh-ho-ho-ho right, the god dude. hey, i got a question for you. "could jesus microwave a burrito so hot, that he himself could not eat it?"
i said wiggum!
oh, yeah? well, i've got news for you. i just got promoted and it's all thanks to "yes-i-cannabis." we have a kitchen?!
good afternoon. i want to thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs...
all right. i'll do it for my kids.
unregardless, i will no longer be a slave to this.
oh, man. oh, man. we killed mr. burns. mr. burns is gonna be so mad.
did you say "life story"? things started out great. i ate what my mother ate. and my mother loved chili. then, suddenly:
kathleen turner!
you name it.
what kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?
is it also the last step?
you're trying to get me angry, thank you.
hi-yo!
one drink won't hurt.
nothing, nothing. there's nothing eating me up inside.
i think he's building to something.
you might hear from your friends or co-workers that apu isn't living at home anymore.
this is going great.
it's been on my list for a long time.
well, hookers and spiderman.
that's it, boy! it's time for your bath! now go to bed! that is called parenting. i'm going to moe's.
right. oh no, not the good cheek! oh.
fine, i won't kill it. finish the job.
well, uh, the thing about that is, uh...
yeah, i've gotten a lot of compliments about my talking.
the missus prefers you call me simpson.
now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... does that ever work?
i'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
can't you do anything? surprise witnesses? evidence tampering? play the race card. play it.
goodbye, marge.
i've made my choice.
no.
oh. seriously, everyone says your parties rock.
you're right. what's this? a cap! from "the woolly bully."
good, 'cause i need directions.
finally, a way to combine my love of helping people with my love of hurting people.
you're pushing your luck, pal.
green vegetables and homework.
if that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, i love this song. i've been driving all night, hand's wet on the wheel... there's a voice in my head that drives my heel... it's my baby callin' on the telephone... i got some pizza and i'm bringin' it home...
i don't get it. i finally did a job where i wasn't lazy, stupid, or corrupt -- and now i'm gonna get killed for it.
she's just like clark kent. when there's lots of excitement, she's nowhere to be found. nighty-night, sweetie.
no, you've got chores to do.
yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card.
yeah, it's a good group.
hey, so are the grammy judges. --
hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?
flanders?! a perfect vacation ruined.
i can't believe it. hibbert's turned you all into human guinea pigs!
so you're just gonna let me walk out of here sober.
well, moe...
hey, you want my keys? get 'em now, jerks. so long, jerks. running after the car, huh? let's see if you can follow this.
of course. it was, uh... some kind of a... light rail.
that my family isn't the center of my universe? are you nuts?
hey, what's this suitcase for? are we going on a trip?
you guys are the best. i love you, i love you, i love you... i'm okay. i love you, i love you, i love you, i love you...
i am so excited i couldn't fall asleep! i even took some pills i found on the floor and still nothing!
like this, mr. kravitz?
i'm so hot for me, i'm so hot for me / i'm so cold...
we know!
no! no, i won't go! you can't make me!
for serious?
evening, fellow rockers.
test, test. check, check.
there's no need for apologies, guys. you're rock stars! you're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail.
stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. nice going, geniuses.
damn your sparkling wordplay!
homicidal robots... so like us.
woo hoo! i win the bet! who's your daddy?
oh, thanks...
sure, why not?
i fell off. hee hee hee.
uh... i was gettin' around to it.
i'm on it.
d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
why can't they just be happy for my success?
hey, get out, i'm in here! oh.
that's lenny? oh, i wanted the black one.
i'll teach you to whistle on the sabbath!
this comes off.
marge! throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!
oh, yes! the tag chafed my throat! let's go eat some bugs.
no more reality shows for us. let's watch some quality scripted television.
the "george foreman mail sorter" will let us know. your family is invited to a free weekend at stagnant springs spa.
well then, you might as well stay with us. we serve the same meat the prisons do!
i'm a people person. who drinks.
look, junior. i expect this to be fixed with quality gm parts.
moe! he's got a dark side i've never dreamed of.
woo hoo! good things do happen to bad people!
now bob, i know you're concerned, but don't worry. i have operatives working the crowd.
well, duh. your king needs these stilts!
whoa, wait. frank grimes wasn't married. how could he have a son?
you know what made me feel better about myself? that award i got for world's greatest dad.
let's go make some fireworks of our own.
purple rain!
here!
now what am i gonna get lisa?
well, yes and no. mostly no.
i did it for the insurance money. look lisa, i'm still trying to get to know you. who's your favorite traveling wilbury? is it jeff lynne?
my name is homer simpson. and i desperately need your help.
chunkylover53.
so sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious.
oh yes. well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! how did you spend a thousand dollars?
of course i do. it's all my fault for refusing to pay... ... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. yes.
hello, this is a phone survey. if the election were held today, would you vote for "a" the cops are there, or "b" you are free to talk?
well, all the childless drunks at moe's thought it was a great idea.
in retrospect, yes.
what do i do now?
no, no worries. this is what all those hours of playing tetris were for. perfect!
it's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!
kids, i'll go find your mother. dad, we're canceling the rest of the play.
ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! i'm married to joey heatherton.
listen, my bulky flower, i-i have an early day...
denser?!
yes...
they thought of everything! how come all the good things happen to jesus h. nice? by which i mean flanders!
well, since i don't have the remote, i can just get up and change the channel.
mmm. move over eggs. bacon just got a new best friend: fudge.
so that's your answer! i'll sue the church!
it's all good.
you're right, marge. i'll make it up to them. by throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!
it's such a mess. watch the teeth!
that's okay. his cute little hands can't even fit around my neck. now he's got it.
is it crispy?
why you little...!
i'll show you worse! i was told this would be televised!
of course, because you wouldn't want to... i paid for your splendor, you...!
yeah, i make up words too. anyway, i was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so i can be a hero to my boy again.
now to win back my son in comfort and style. you know, i could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home.
well, kathy, i'll tell you. it's viagrogaine. it gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. what are you waiting for, loser?
you seem like an impartial observer. but i've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
that sounds like a magical family moment. i'm sorry i won't be there.
that was awesome!
the pig?
yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car.
ooh! lemme guess. skinner's mother. she sure knows how to swing it.
hey, don't blame me, i voted for the green m&m.
me too. uh-oh. here comes helen fielding.
it was an application to open a cinnabon stand.
what?
eh, i'm still undecided.
from the unknown toaster.
you call this a bicameral legislature? i say, i say... my groin!
oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. have some more liquor. that's it, drink up my pretty.
three coats.
uh, well, i drew it on... see...
go on ahead. i'll just slow you down.
well, he does. all my life i've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. mr. burns has never given me a thumbs up or a "way to be" or a "you go, girl." no, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small.
get rid of a bird? no way. their eyes are so expressive.
hello!
eat crowd, old man!
i need a vacation.
lisa, i deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce.
how did you ever run this place? you've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon...
yeah. ow! ow! he bit me! you saw him! he bit me! you little...
no, of course not! duh-uh.
i'unno. what am i, superdad?
i wish god were alive to see this.
oh, right. chinese guy, chinese guy, frisbee dog...
or when i messed up taping "city slickers 2" and cut off the end. was curly's gold just a legend?
yeah.
more like, where didn't i find it. it was practically everywhere.
oh, i get it. your stupid husband is too "drunk" to do it right.
kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think.
nice to meet you, stuart.
well, get used to it, 'cause i'm gonna stay.
you noticed! i've been using lancôme.
tennessee williams?! but how did he survive in the world of theater?
it would take a man of stone with a funny bone of steel to resist that.
i gotta go.
so, she didn't hate me. she married me because she loved me!
maybe.
his name is ned!
hey, what are we gonna wear tomorrow?
and fight the crowds? forget it. the simpsons are going to bart's idea!
how many decks will your blackjack dealers use?
it's the beef hormones and the fluorescent lights. what are you gonna do?
woo hoo! in your face, imaginary guy!
look, i have no idea who frank lloyd wright is.
heck no, the amish did it. who knows more about electricity than the amish?
god no, it sucks.
sweet. welcome back to the family, boy.
aww. there, there, boy. i'll help you get him back. he may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a simpson that isn't.
i'm sorry i was ever mean to you. marge, prepare the celebration ham.
yeah, but he ate the last can of tuna.
you can't just "get" a cell phone.
i'll take 'em.
no. from now on, walking is my beer. and feeling good is my hangover.
look at those suckers in their metal coffins. i can go to work any way i want.
it sure has. you see this bulge back here? now it actually is a fanny pack. no, wait. it's still my ass. but your point is well taken. you see... i like to walk down the avenue / bust a move with disco stu...
oh, i love to perambulate / it's standing still i really hate / so let me please reiterate / i love to...
yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever.
nothing could be farther from the... you could be on to something there, doc... sorry, i got a lot on my mind.
here's a dollar.
that i fixed with new words!
only teasing. we've flown in the finest busboys from france... i mean, america!
five-h?
the noble chiefs outsmarted the treacherous cowboys with a seven-yard screen pass. unfortunately, after further review, the great father in the sky determined that the receiver's moccasins were out of bounds. i shall bet no more forever.
it's laxative-free for today's lifestyle!
you talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!
woo-hoo! pedal to the metal!
no way! i'm not gettin' my fingerprints on that train wreck. but if i lose maggie, i'm oh-for-three. i've gotta get her back.
get your own family, moe.
uh, no, that was me.
moe, i was just thinking, if maggie and i were in the neighborhood, maybe we could drop by and have a playdate with you... and your ham.
does this mean they'll never cancel the jim belushi show?
leave everything to me. pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... take an dirt nap. feed the worms... hm.
the nobel prize! finally. so, uh it's for what, my whole deal?
let the baby have her bottle.
bart, you're not at school. don't swear!
i wish! look at this headline. someone, or something, knows i love oversized food and short, punchy articles. so they hid a message in the first letter of each line. see: "homer, meet me 4th street overpass, midnite." wait a minute. this is today's paper. that meeting is tonight!
mom? you're back. just like you were back before, then you left me again. i love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. oh, what the heck. give me a hug, you.
cora, is there a back way outta here?
woo hoo! i can be a little boy again! a boy who gets some on the side.
no! i can't lose my mother again! don't take her away!
oh, stop it.
last week's garbage. i missed the pick-up date. but it doesn't matter, because my mom is alive. see? i-m-o-- --k". get it? "i am ok."
why don't you start a rumor that he's...ding-a-ling-a-ling hello-oo! oh, what a delicious quiche! i drive a pink miata.
oh, i'm so confused.
why can't you have a normal dream, like being an olympic figure skater?
you know the drill. try to land on my back-fat.
marge, i'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. now let's see, which rifle should i bring?
thank you.
now, now, let's just look... there's big ben, there's piccadilly circus, there's jimmy page, one of the greatest thieves of american black music who ever walked the earth. bup, there's the kids.
saying what?
the queen of whaaa?!
america rules! our beatles are way better than your precious rolling stones!
boy, it's a good thing i'm leaving before i went nuts. goodbye sparkly elves.
kids, we're going mother's day shopping! i'm glad this holiday only comes every four years.
marge, you're gonna love my present. it is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap.
marge, please. i'm too upset to talk about it.
no, go ahead.
what kind of an example would i be if i didn't take revenge on things?
that is so cool. all right, you can come.
son, can i have cuts?
yeah, well uh, funny thing about that... on our way to the clinic, i decided to give him a night his wang would never forget.
who has more power? miss america or miss u.s.a.?
so did i, son. and look where i am today. boy, everybody loves my show.
marge, i thank god every day you settled for me. hey, where's my car?
oh my god! a dvd player.
thank you! freak.
it's fine. everyone just relax, lock your doors, don't make eye contact with anyone and listen to the radio.
oh, this is sadder than "tuesdays with morrie." c'mon marge, i'm not the only selfish person. you have to get your hair done at "supercuts." i guess regular "cuts" just isn't good enough for you.
oh mcgrew. once again you've mistaken something for something!
thank god! there's still four more days 'til christmas. i have time to reform my ways! i just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. it was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at christmas. and get this: he learns a lesson!
and i filed down all the sharp corners. see, your eye is completely safe.
here's your skates. oh, you'll have to take off those boots.
i've got it... when everyone's asleep, i'll take away their presents. then they'll be happy! thanks, buddha.
look, maggie! funny daddy! too hard.
honey, this marriage is a partnership. when you fall, i pick you up. and when you can't finish a sandwich, i eat that sandwich.
you've probably heard a lot of bad things about families come first. but newspaper writers are a bunch of jerks. who really opposes "families come first?" many childless advocates are like ben affleck -- famous, successful people from out of state! they live in fancy houses in other places. "families come first" is supported by lifelong springfieldians you know and trust like me, milhouse's dad, bumblebee man, surly duff, and that jerk that goes "yeees!" for more information, visit our website, www.al-jazeera.com. we're not affiliated. we're just piggybacking on their message board. i am rudy giuliani. do as i command you. i am rudy giuliani. do as i command you.
i'm confused! which is it?
here we go. now it starts with the fees. i'll assemble it myself.
that's it!
pretended.
oh no! my recurring nightmare is coming true! there are many people i'd like to thank for this award. my wife, anjelica huston -- this is for you, angie! we did it!
bart, i'm sorry -- i could never build a robot this awesome. i'm a fraud.
he knows just how i like my martinis... full of alcohol.
oh no! i hit the grief counselor!
get with the program, marge. your husband is now an ambulance driver!
fine, fine. i'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment.
i'll say. oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. i'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice.
well what?
so, how much bleach did you drink? not a talker, eh?
how can you write such horrible things about me?
in marge's book i was so mean and you were so nice. how can i be more like you? just give me some advice.
all right, we're back to square one. put on some coffee.
home sweet home. now to watch some tv.
you don't have to tell me, i was number three. listen, you have any pointers for a newbie?
nope.
i want to get a second house. closer to work.
you didn't sit on the toilet!
yeah!
i'm sorry we wasted your time, your lordship.
go, seminoles!
that's me. huh-oh-muh-eh-er!
i know, we'll use reverse psychology. maggie, don't press the red button! damn it!
zing.
what would jesus view?
oh honey, don't be scared. look, they killed the evil doll.
but i did delete him from my bulk email list.
and the peanuts in your mouth.
don't tell my kids i'm going to jail! tell them i've joined the blue man group! i'm the fat one!
oh my god! maggie, you're talking!
marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!
well yeah, legally. but if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?
ooh! can i have my special cup?
yep. your mother and i have become a legendary party couple. like scott and zelda munster!
ahh, the germans. you just can't stay mad at 'em.
that's my girl!
my demons and i are closer than ever. next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. i'm just goin' in to bust marge out.
that woman means the world to me. would it be all right if i read from my bible?
hey, i only drink that when i'm already drunk.
is it lenny?
uh-huh. when does training start?
you just don't understand boys. he's stupid.
i'm changing the batteries in all the remotes. we're all out of triple a's, so i'm gonna whittle down a couple of these d's.
don't worry. your secret's safe with me. marge, guess what! skinner wants to bail on his wedding!
don't worry, i've got a man on the perimeter.
unkink the hose!
which are you saying is dead? our marriage or our batteries?
and a one and a two and a...
marge, the greatest day of my life was the day you and i became one. would you marry me again?
i say you don't exist!
so, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?
marge, let's do it.
and tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump.
oh, right.
and yet, i've never been to me. that sliding should stop soon. this rolling is just temporary. ah, that's better. so why do they call this place niagara falls anyway?
nope. just lookin' for that golden ticket. nope, nothing, nope, nada, the golden ticket! at long last.
comely... succulent... clearly had a snout job... ugh, too eighties.
somebody ought to take him down a peg. or, should i say, down a pie.
this is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
so it would seem. anyhoo, i'll bet this is all a pretty big surprise, huh? mild-mannered homer simpson...
since when do i listen to cakes?
do i get two paychecks?
you know i'm not pie man.
no. i won't. there's only one way i can escape from this nightmare.
mr. simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?
why? because i only kissed one girl in my whole life? that's still one more than you.
there goes a good friend.
she wouldn't do that -- we shared something special.
marge, i'm really sorry i hurt you. but i've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun i hid from you, the time i sued the church, ruining lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?
here you go.
everybody remember that for when his hearing comes back.
son, i've learned one thing in this life: to stay out of trouble, just say nothing. don't rock the boat. don't even get in the boat. just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. but don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy.
do you get time off for snitching on your cellmates?
now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. but you can't spell u.s.a. without us... eh?
yes.
no, marge, there's one group that's always welcome in america: immigrants without i.d.
here's a poem: "run fast, or lose your ass"!
these batteries have to power everything in our house! yo, i'll tell you what i want, what i really really want... what i want what i want i'll tell you what i... that was totally worth it.
well, that loser milhouse has always had a thing for her. don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?
see, lisa? instead of one big shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks xeroxing their worthless opinions.
people's deaths, eh? do me! do me!
c'mon, shoot me a new one! oh, i'm so scared. ned flanders is pointing a gun at me. you couldn't even shoot me by accident, even if i whacked the barrel like this.
everything's comin' up homer.
captain!
and to make sure we get there super fast, i'm hitting all the buttons with my palm.
oh c'mon, marge. it's not fair to compare us to an american household.
a contractor? those guys are the biggest crooks around. they charge for materials and labor! pick one, jerks! man, that hurt. and now to do the exact same thing again.
of course not. why would i want to look at a nude woman i'm not even married to? i mean, i wouldn't even know how she could improve me.
get lost, crook!
i'm proud of you, honey.
but win the contest?
yeah, and your father's "no house." now scram. maybe i was a little hard on him. oh, well. bart, i know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. but what's going on up here?
well, it's better they hear it from me now, than from their parents when they're old enough.
all right.
so they're growing up. soon they'll be leaving the nest, and you'll have time for yourself. hundreds of thousands of hours. and then, the peace of the grave.
but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?
what's happened to us, marge? we used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. then came the heart attacks.
marge! i figured out a way we can get in on this quimby lawsuit! bart, go ahead.
more!
good news, marge! i've learned to walk naked on stilts!
all right. but while i'm gone, boy, you think about what you did.
what do women want?!
i wouldn't say that.
yeah. nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.
it's awesome. you know what i've gotten into? sleeping 'til noon.
i'm pathetic? because i take money from my ten-year-old son? well, let me tell you something: i still call the shots around here!
it's el flanderito! run him down!
hey, maybe the internet has the information i need! it certainly answered a lot of my questions about wang enhancement. www.nuclear-secrets.com. are you a terrorist? no. "would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?" no. i will never tire of the bar scene! let's see, i can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano... all i need is some plutonium and i know just the place to get it.
i never complain about your frilly pillows.
are you prepared to take that chance?
re-straint! re-straint! re-straint! lighten up, marge. this is my chance to relax with people from work i never get to see. like this guy.
c'mon, marge. this place is great. free admission, great grub and we got to use the bathroom of the future.
phobos? that's a good job for me.
why the sweet talk, apu? are you after some cheap drugs?
my butt looks so huge during perp walks.
we really appreciate your help, johnny. is there any way we can repay ya?
now remember to eat smart, people. go for the fancy foods -- don't let 'em fill you up with that cheap stuff.
moe's, a tribute. "m" is for moe, the owner of moe's. "o" is for the "o" in the middle of moe's. "e" is for acceptance. the feeling i always got here at moe's. oh moe, don't let 'em close you down!
i had to! or moe's would stay closed forever!
how many magic beans should i sell the baby for? three? duh, der, duh. that's me, jerk-ass homer. duh, der, doy.
thanks, honey. my mind is completely at ease.
well... i'm worried about marge and moe. they've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. but it's not physical. so everything's great, right?
catch your flight?
marge!
marge, i just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on moe, here's my card.
oh, the prid is gone.
sure do. i'm happy!
"l" is for "loser," which describes you, sir. don't try to stop me. just enjoy the view, sir.
this is either about me, or steroids.
dammit!
sure, i'd be happy to tell you my problem. i've got a venue the whole world will be watching, and nothing to fill it with.
welcome to the "homer simpson showboating academy." today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
how do i look? after my makeover i'm gonna get you, boy.
boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand. you did it on the straight, got your dad's permission / but your mom dropped a bomb, so i flipped my position
follow instructions? he's doomed! this'll be the worst thanksgiving dinner ever.
...bart was never kidnapped! lisa, i'm very glad you brought me this. i'll see that it gets to the proper authorities.
wow, those jackets are beautiful.
eh, who needs tourists? they never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway. have you read them all? okay, good.
hm... where's lenny and carl?
please, kent. call me your holiness.
i wasn't joking.
correction. the first blimp that got her pregnant.
you handsome devil. someday they'll let you and me get married! can you imagine the children?
oh, dad. how i'll miss your cap, your walking stick, your plaster base...
woo hoo! no pressure!
woo hoo! that's been my dream ever since i heard it existed right now. what do i get?
you monster!
son, menopause is when the stork that brings babies gets shot by drunken hunters.
hey look, a dragon.
deal.
wha?
i would, but marge would kill me... i mean ohh, right.
but he loves me. why you little... i'll endanger you!
none. no wait, three. since the last one, i don't remember so good.
okay. i'll just hire a haulage firm to cart them away... at my expense! directory assistance?
hey, i earn that money -- while you lounge around here, doing laundry and putting up drywall, i'm at work busting my hump.
dammit!
hmmm. a place to dock, eh? i got room -- i have a back yard that makes my front yard look like an idiot.
that's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
hey, that judge thought i rocked. case closed! although my case is still open.
thank god for that turkish freighter. now we'll just go get 'em and...
cool.
but he misread my pee! he misread my peeeee!
well, i am a sucker for a little hat.
well, if you really must know... i'm a prison snitch.
what happened to the guards?! okay, okay. don't panic. maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant.
the guards are sadistic and cruel!
oh, marge... oh, right. separated.
exactly.
so what's stephen hawking doing here?
i'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.
ray, will you help me fix my roof?
don't worry, honey. i found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where.
impresses. what a big word! i'm gonna look that up.
don't worry -- ray'll be back any minute.
of course we are! if you wanna be.
he is too! his truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. right now. right now. now. now. nnnnnnnnow. now. now. now. nnnow.
what am i doing here? let me go!
wow. my subconscious is a genius. well, that's all very convincing, and...
nope, just you, marge and yogi bear. kidding!
so, ray does exist?!
what time's the show on?
and if i wanna see it, what time should i watch it?
at what time?
cbs.
c'mon, son. you can fight this. do the bartman. do the bartman! why don't you dance? dance?!
wow, he's just the kind of weirdo bart needs.
how much is got, wolfgang schmuck?
oh boy. marge, i know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to...
where will i sleep?
but it's my burger.
interesting. it's like a corndog without the dog.
don't lose hope, sweetie. i'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. and that's not just the beer talking. your father's in here too.
i wrote it about shelbyville, then changed the names.
don't worry honey, the song i wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make "moon river" sound like a farting orangutan.
you love sausage but you hate to see it getting made.
hey, come back! i'm calming down! we'll have family fun! family funnnnn!
i don't think cookies are gonna make me feel better. oh god! oh, they're delicious! oh, so happy! oh god, they're... they're gone.
sure did. i'd do anything for you, honey. especially if it's easy.
"left below." ooh, a "he is risen" production!
yeah, i'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. thanks marge, you've put my mind at ease. now how about a little "rapture" for mama?
no, thank you.
uhhh... here's one -- revelation 6:13. just before the rapture, "the stars will fall to the earth." so all you hippies out there might want to for that one.
no, flanders. it's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. you wouldn't be interested. all right, everybody. pair up with a rapture buddy who will watch your back through all eternity.
huh. my watch must be running fast. wait for it... wait for it... wait for it... wait for it... wait for it... wait for it... wait for it... wait for it...
but my prediction says--
i could. wait! before you go, there's one thing i gotta know. what happened to my family?
i'm sorry. but heaven isn't heaven without my family in it.
yeah, i missed you guys too. now if you'll excuse me...
come on flanders, doesn't that "bible" of yours say to "love thy neighbor"? why won't you love me?
i've had enough -- i'm leaving! i'm stuck. why did i eat that apple segment?
well that's obvious. he doesn't even know.
...ead.
um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, i want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all...
hey, you knocked out my power. how am i supposed to eat without watching tv?
shut up, flanders. but some things i could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit... ...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. oh, ned, i don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?
and if you get kicked out of that one, you're going straight in the army. where you'll be sent straight to america's latest military quagmire. where will it be? north korea? iran? anything's possible with commander cuckoo bananas in charge.
classic grampa.
all pancakes aside, i really came here to talk about my son.
celibacy?! i was talking about the meat on friday thing. man, you guys got more crazy rules than blockbuster video.
look, marge, i know i was supposed to yell at that priest, but he's so cool. he plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!
marge, what are you doing here?
c'mon broncos... you can do it...
a scam? not according to "eddie f. from tucson," or "football millionaire in beloit, michigan."
thanks, moe!
look, if you promise never to tell her, i'll let you be in the movie.
who's gonna watch the kids?
you mean "homer's famous marinara sauce."
moe! will you get off the line!
we'll say it's all our birthdays!
marge?
you're needed at home! you're needed at home!
okay. to save the manatees, i guess i could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that.
poor dumb country mouse. can't even count.
yes... but i've got a friend who owes me a solid.
what man would want this now?! two four six eight! i hate stamps! they aren't great! okay, how about this? seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. everyone forget that.
there's a little plastic man in your hair and i'm trying to rescue him. no soldier left behind.
no one's gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --
exactly. now, what has two ears but can't hear?
you know that racecar bed i made him?
now marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake... run, marge! start the car!
praise the lord, i can walk again! what, my foot fell asleep.
i dunno, maybe. plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox.
ladies and gentlemen, presenting... the sister with the blisters... the tot with all the spots... maggie!
mmm... homer-oats.
this-this is marge's bra. i bought it for her boobs!
well, methinks the lady doth protest too much!
well, i got your note saying you were gonna bring me a bucket of potato salad.
we'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
and he's great with the neighbors.
david feels, and your mother will agree when i tell her, that it's best for our family if you're no longer in it.
woo hoo! suckers.
aw, i can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions.
marge, i don't hate your mother. i just won't be sad when she dies. forty-seven, forty-eight... yeah, sure. whatever you want. ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana...
just liftin' this dumbbell. forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!
gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. maybe she doesn't care anymore!
i can relate. i've fought that foe and lost many times. moe, i'm starting to have grave doubts about this thing i barely liked in the first place.
kids, this is the holiest night of the year. tomorrow is father's day, and that makes tonight father's day eve.
bart, this is the greatest present i ever received. to open another gift now would be like following the london philharmonic with jessica simpson. whatchu got, lisa? what the hell is this?
i mean i will win you back.
oh, i know! but how can i undo eight years of jerkiness in two easy sessions at no cost to me?
stop this bus!
this looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!
what can i do? i'm only one man.
well, there's my x-ray vision, my fire breath... and i can get big laughs with tennis balls. bloop, bloop, bloop. bloop, bloop, bloop.
no, but i swam in it.
aw, thanks. now how 'bout a dance with your daddy? i can't believe i lost after ben affleck campaigned day and night for me.
you're like all easter bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. oh, hey marge.
i bet you can't throw a cat over the house.
i'm not!
you're sending me to italy?
marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?
i get it -- the midget represents dwarves.
americano? what the hell could that mean? why can't you people learn to speak my language? i learned to eat your food!
yeah, i never went to college.
it's called a hangover, sweetie. and it's an unavoidable part of life.
but i do a great impression of him. i am the gayest super-villain ever! beware my scented candles! oooooo, scented!
no tip till they bring back hagar the horrible!
oh, it's just what i wanted. here, marge, this is for you.
oh, that is so cool! ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!
uh... well i... i think you're my pappy!
mason, come see my room!
i drew this picture of you.
but how?
hmm, this camp's got it all -- climbing some kind of rope thing, wearing a backpack, high-fiving the black kid. it's the perfect thing to straighten you out.
oh yeah?! you're going to that camp, 'cause i'm gonna drive you there.
see bart, i told you things could be worse.
fine. but the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
thank you, colonel.
try this one...
mr. stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if i whipped up public interest for them?
it's not supposed to.
silly indians. our god made their god.
no unicorns.
hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. like this! i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid!
well, i guess i should explain. not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so i was out in the forest, hiding.
a living duck! i wished too hard and he became real!
so marge, in tomorrow's game i'm gonna recover a fumble just for you.
i am gonna get them so wet.
oh, you haven't seen bart for a few hours, so you automatically assume i let something terrible happen.
i fell asleep before the monkey. uh-oh.
i mean the one at the house.
oh yeah, well right there's a commercial with a dancing cold sore.
there's a chance we won't win? my collection is complete. forty years of the family circus.
that's just the product i've been coveting! pick us! pick us!
yeah, well i have full tenure.
you take forever to say nothing. ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on fox. why'd you do it?
uh, okay. there's this guy that got killed -- i think it was in miami? so c.s.i. miami investiga-ted-ed it. then a family said how much they loved the olive garden. then i fell asleep. when i woke up, letterman was talking to alias.
i thought it was about her boobs. tonight on jock center: a slugger on 'roids, tiger woods is annoyed, and north korean missiles deployed!
you're a useless old man! name one thing you do for this family.
mo-vie! mo-vie! mo-vie! mo-vie! mo-vie!
that's me!
are you kavi?
well, a little book once told me... ...having only one pancake leaves room for more bacon.
marge?
i'm so bored, i figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats. see, it goes: ship's wheel, popeye tattoo, gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel.
oh baby...
what-ever.
i do!
uh, gimme a second, i'm in the bathroom. what? i have great ass suction. now how 'bout a little privacy? my keys!
well, you know what a man invented? actual paper.
let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
seventy-four? oh sorry, there's been a mistake.
marge, i don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail.
i am! we're the same age!
why you little...
well, maybe if we snuggle, it might rattle some memories loose.
marge, if i can't make you remember me, then i'll make you fall for me all over again. the heart is the symbol for love.
i know. wait, i thought of another way: i stay!
the wisest, wettest man you'll ever meet.
and her?
yeah, she's over in post now.
woo-hoo! weapons!
sorry, flanders. but when you get in, you can use my audio tour. narrated by melanie griffith.
i love it when you're not into it. oh yeah, baby. oh yeah that's it ignore me. i'm not even here.
now you can only see butts on cable.
ooh, iced tea!
hey, we've gone through more hardships than the jews and charlie brown put together.
interesting, interesting.... buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own marge.
why, 'cause i'm fat?
okay. so, why didn't you marry one of your crummy backup dancers?
oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. real fair. class act. i'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. and i'll do it with or without you!
wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!
sorry, marge, can't hear ya!
okay. take it, take it! just don't hurt me! okay pretty boy, where's fat tony's fifty bucks?
but this is the only life i know!
marge, could you let it go? you won. she's dead!
i'm sending you mixed messages! now get the hell outta here! i love you so much. damn you!
not if i can help it, lisa!
then stand back!
what's the point? we're all slowly dying.
oh, uh... you know what they say, "hammer with the wood and it's all good." it's allll good.
marge, giving me credit was your idea. now could you rub my butt? i sat on it so much it's a little sore.
and i promised these guys money i don't have! and they're gonna be so mad!
and now to get stinking drunk!
you always find an excuse not to make out. ooh, a space marshmallow! where do you think you're going?
uh, no. just gas.
dr. phil mcgraw!
it's amazing. he tastes just like jeffrey tambor.
hey, i'm not done dancin'! this bulletin better swing!
eh, big deal -- by the time bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! we're china, right?
ooh, "who makes what in america." army private: fourteen thousand a year.
man, you've got an awesome voice.
nope. i'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!
thanks, moe. how can i ever repay you?
the senior olympics? that's what i was supposed to remember?! too late. the deed is done.
oooh, moe's a poet! he has a soul! flutter your wings! it's teatime in buttercup junction! moe's the princess of lollipop land! he lunches on lavender and potpourri! seriously moe, i think you have a gift.
hey, thanks for the heads-up! we'll see ya when we see ya!
what'd i do?
max told you about me?
you kids like ice cream?
you're glad? you don't look glad. are you sure you know what glad means?
sweetie, i can't abandon my route even for one day. if those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, i am screwed. but i'll be back in time for your show.
marge, let me explain: i had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families...
wow! you made me a sculpture of magilla gorilla.
oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. but you still have to go.
oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. broken, lonely grownups. chapter one: the rubystone in the door-portal. are you asleep yet?
an unexpected occurrence?! what could it be?!
the end.
just think, lisa, if i had paid for those skating lessons, that could've been you!
marge, we have a problem here.
don't worry, i make six of those a year.
marge, i have no idea what you were just thinking about. why would you think i did?
for your information, since i bought it i put on a ton of weight.
and to think, he and i once shared a shower.
i didn't say "stop."
oh, they're getting a little exercise.
ew, it tastes terrible!
dear marge, how are you? i am fine. the waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. and the salt water is rising. what's next? pepper water? ha ha. love ya, homer simpson.
what's the code word? oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the greeks called you poseidon, the romans... aquaman. look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again. do you think your mother will ever remarry?
then when all seemed lost...
may we? may we? mais oui!
nine a.m.?! i swear revenge on meaux! even if it takes me the rest of my life! can you loosen my arm so i can shake my fist?
oooh, the the! but why are you helping me?
oui oui! and i have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!
oh, right -- revenge!!
parents who are still alive, i might add.
i don't know. let's just lay here till we figure it out.
what's your hurry?
it's dark in here!
actually... that was me.
son, one day you're going to be a great father.
i don't know. you can put horseradish on your dead mother for all i care. the point is, i'm rich, rich, rich! just look -- my dog has his own jacuzzi! he loves it!
oh, spirit. are you gonna show me my future? my snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? well, it's not too late for me to change! you there, boy! buy me a christmas goose! the biggest one in the shop!
look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. but the school's paying for five sessions and there's a chinese restaurant next door where i can get drunk.
what the? but i thought bankruptcy was the cool law! the one that says "dude, don't worry about it. i got this."
why are you telling me? he's your father-in-law.
well i never, ever want to see that again.
okay, but i'm not good at details. or the big picture. i also show up late, and drunk. i've got a good feeling about this.
a thousand, eh?
i don't have to make a wish, because i already have this wonderful family. i wish for infinity hamburgers.
aw. our kids used to be so cute! used to?! oh, deal with it.
marge! this isn't like you.
how 'bout you, gabbo?
oh, uh... she's looking very snappy!
i wanted to remember my place in the book i was reading.
if you don't mind! thank you! now to make a young woman's wedding day all about me!
thanks, moe!
not naked, i haven't.
hilarious joke?
she has not! your daughter's a dirty player!
lisa, sweetie, i was just following the rules.
it's a documentary... by the b.b.c... in cooperation with canal plus...
i hate shopping. i'm bored, my feet hurt, i'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the "husband chair?"
well, who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this? it works with my body's natural curves and supports my back-boobs.
hey, get off my case! he's the choke artist!
relax. i'm a licensed mattress professional, if there were such a thing. and i've got the answer to your problems -- the snugulux, by matrimonium!
on one condition: you do the shlepping.
look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here.
it's like our honeymoon all over again. aw, we even have the same bum looking at us.
how is that possible?
zombie kill.
is that one?
burns stiffed us!
and some stuff i wanted.
we're not thieves, we're scavengers! like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or america's sweetheart, the maggot.
where the hell is abigail adams?! oh, there she is. where the hell is mary todd lincoln?! oh, she's right there. where the hell is ida saxton mckinley?! oh i see. where the hell is--
deep down, i... i guess i knew that.
no. and never bring it up again.
whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not made of money!
hey, lay off -- you're the fat one of you guys!
can i have some more money?
oh, i'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!
nothing's gonna ruin this one. the timer's a tickin.
oh god, my gums! they hurt so much!
sure do. let's go get ice cream!
fine, cone. what's this?!
the happiness swept me away!
i'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. you can stay. but you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our wall of casual acquaintances who came to stay for a while. apu sang a song. what are you gonna do?
true -- but there's room for the truth in this household. do you wanna hear something really bad kent told me about the fox network?
uh-huh. see you at five then.
oh my god... lionel richie?! can you sing "say you say me," but make it about beer?
i'm so happy!
a fresh face!
okay. uh... well uh... hm, i just uh. i forget what i do. wait, wait. uh, this is some of what i do, i think. sometimes i go places. this is our relish tray. i'd like you to film it for insurance purposes. what's the point of putting my socks on? i just have to take them off again a week later.
dr. fredrick j. waxman, you're a genius!
well, i can see the position of handsomest c.e.o. is already taken.
stop peppering me with questions!
stop saying "security"!
yeah, uh... semper fudge!
i drove a car over a cliff once. how different could it be? hm, what's the ocean doing in the sky?
and now, to taxi to the terminal.
i wanna say one.
dude! you don't think you know me, but you do!
of course.
my pleasure. if ever i would leave you / it wouldn't be in summer. / seeing you in summer i never would go...
ho danneggiato il mio piede! nei cieli bigi guardo fumar dai mille comignoli parigi.
sorry, lisa. can't change the future. and the home of the bra-a-ave!
keep reachin' for the stars, kid.
no problem.
so did you see the show tonight? remember the part where i forgot the words and i just sang "uh-oh spaghetti-os". i'm hoping they send me a case.
before you go, could you hire your own replacement? but make sure she's not crazy like you.
kick my heels up and
does it work?
wow, i'd really like to meet this guy.
some of those were pretty funny.
man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life.
i'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.
it's homer, idiot.
is louie keeping you prisoner here?
okay, we've got time for one more.
point one five.
chief, you gotta do something -- my current wife is in there!
the problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you.
hey, what's that?
well, they're not as pretty as you, marge.
hey, who wants ice cream in bed?
don't worry, son -- i've got a plan to save your space doggy.
no one likes a know-it-all.
way to go! many happy returns.
is "beautiful" a color?
i want to, but i can't!
hazel! your eyes are hazel -- hazel like the pussywillows by the pond where we first kissed, like the almond paste in the bear claw i ate after we first made love.
i pay ten dollars a tube for those!
i do! i do!
what's your secret?
please, doc. i know i'm not the greatest looking guy in the world, but i took care of my family, and that used to be enough. but not anymore.
a smart successful woman like you deserves the very best.
yeah, i'm gonna turn off the lights now.
noooo!
all i want is a battery.
why is everything hollywood makes so excellent? whyyyy?
more ribs for me!
mr. doobner, i have a complaint: i work hard, and when i go out with my family, i expect a certain level of basic--
now? but i'm getting a home perm!
a doctor, huh?
eat hobo remains!
chief wiggum! i remember seeing you...
really? well, that's great, dad. how can i ever repay you?
this is great! i'm finally gonna find out how i ruined my family! strap me in, nerd!
bring it on.
see? that's where my memory stops. who the heck is that guy? what if you just moved the bottle? all right. let me just get out of this bubble smoothly and elegantly. how can i get my memory to work?
a surprise party?
what plan?
no, this is a moment i want to remember.
a drive-up trashcan! this must be how the rich toss out their gold. and as long as i'm cleaning out the family chariot... cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks... hmm... "dispose of proper--" this book is too hard. now for a victory cigar.
i live in that place!
if you haven't sprung from, or aren't married to my loins, get the hell out of this house! you too, fred thompson.
i dig the wig! i dig the wig!
like which kid's their favorite! it's lisa.
and once we were back together, i was too happy ever to grunge again.
hm, it seems like a lot...
c'mon. c'mon. oh c'mon.
uh-huh.
i'll bet no man would touch you.
hey marge, looking for something? i'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper i don't like. maybe it'll be this one. wrong again.
pudding power activate!
that's right. now i'll cut and you soak.
where's our jerky?
i thought this might happen, so i brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow.
uh... are you sure you want lisa to keep dancing?
come on out, boy.
all right, that's it, pull over.
don't worry, you can stay with us. i'm sure marge will be cool.
just sit still in my lap!
yeah, me too. since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word "pop" out of all of our foods.
don't you worry about wikipedia -- we'll change it when we get home. we'll change a lot of things.
and i'll make sure flanders doesn't bother us.
up-bup-bup-bup-bup... when you know the people you're begging from, it's mooching. moleman! come here, ya big bag-a skin! how the hell are ya, huh?!
"film festival," eh?
we can't wait to see it, sweetie. a documentary?!
not if i can help it! c'mere, beams! come on! hey, hey, where you going? oh, there's too many!
well, this is kind of a cute outfit.
that's it...
you're alive! and you baked a pie!
well i'm not going to digest it!
oh, this just gets worse and worse.
i mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? does she know i feel bad about things i said?
i'm really glad you corrected me, lisa. people are always really glad when they're corrected.
show me the law that says i can't! wheee!
you monster! on another subject, next thursday i have to leave work early. i assume that's cool.
now i'll just add water to these ashes and bring my mother back to life.
fine -- but you just bought yourself "ear piercing" and "strange new feelings."
this is the first book i've ever finished reading or pushing things into. we missed one!
five dollars cash!
you got it, boy.
what a great job. and i could use a job right now.
hey, ned. i brought you something. he hands a greeting card to ned. angle on: greeting card
no problem.
the biggest one in town.
well, i like a.c.-d.c.
there's one thing he didn't count on: my reckless indifference to human life!
marge, what's going on?
well, you'll never take me alive! forgot my keys.
make it life and you've got a deal.
we're doing laundry.
absolutely -- that unpleasantness in ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds.
hmmm, you make a good case. i'll take it!
i don't want your pity booze. i'll pay for it myself.
get out here, boy! i wanna punish you before i get drunk and merciful!
if that boy thinks i'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! stupid kids... think i'm made of hormones...
take me with you! i'll be anything and everything you want! don't leave me here with them!
he rhymes! oh, happy day!
hey, everybody pees in the pool!
eh, let my dad enjoy 'em a little longer.
limbo? you mean the dance or that place where unbaptized babies go? either way, i'm in.
i'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.
i never thought i'd say this, but... stupid flanders.
marge, what are you doing here?
listen, you're a classy lady and a great sushi fighter. but you're goin' in the box.
you're just as bad as me. and you used to be better, so that makes you worse! i don't think we can ever trust each other again. ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare.
i know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, i'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it. i hate other people's love.
awww.
seymour... edna asked me to talk to you.
oh, i'm afraid lenny's dead.
who are you?
i want you to put it all on my little girl. and parlay with the asian kid.
right, right. but will it happen this time?
uh... the sun did that.
wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
okay. what can i do for you? please, i'm begging you!
i'm really thirty-eight.
ah, interesting. why just the other day i was reading that science is used to make bombs.
i'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.
oh my god!
just lis-ten! i'm grinding them now! ow! my finger! ooh, here comes the ambulance! my, you're a handsome fellow. just get in the ambulance, mr. simpson. we'll see to your finger. why thank you. ow! my finger!
pfft! knew it.
thank you.
really? i thought it was lisa with a beard of bees. well whatever, brace yourself.
i'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
sweetie, i have a very special surprise for you.
toldja, marge. tol. dja.
we... i... you come up with an excuse!
what a racket.
wait! is it some place i have to put on a tie?
if he's lucky. the guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's god. well, god doesn't need his own special day!
tears of a clown.
no. yes.
california casual.
woo hoo!
dondelinger!
you lie. you love me!
marge, unlike c.p.r., this is something i must know.
sorry, debbie. i hope you can find happiness without me.
i'm class president.
my own plaque! and one for vice president butthead! cool. is that why you brought me here, spirits?
god no!
absolutely. insurance is the greatest deal ever. if i get hurt, i get paid. and man, do i get hurt. what a week.
me too, baby. but we gotta get real.
baby, i hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause i'm about to file a claim.
so, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not.
oh man. who'd think the first day of lent would be such a bummer?
goodbye.
no problem. just let sir fix-a-lot slay this chore. next problem.
oh, right -- like "dateline" did to you!
fine. you're mad. what are you gonna do about it?
ew, that's gross.
i know it seems that way, because i'm such a vivid storyteller. now here's another story called "bart's mistake." we were walking home when how could this have happened?
never! hooray for stupid flanders!
wolves are taking all our women.
'cause she was fighting my dog and stealing my poison. now give her back so i can take her home to my rat-infested house!
no, marge. you're the most giving person i know. besides, i gave them another gem child to sit on their precious throne.
i want to buy your fanciest hot tub!
hmm. probably a reminder to relax more.
sir, i brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar.
hey, boyo -- how about a tall cool one? how about you, greensleeves? irishmen love to get drunk.
moe, something terrible has happened! the irish have become hardworking and sober!
it was apt.
sweetie, any place i'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world.
maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. and that would be a big surprise because i'd forget about it pretty quick.
marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. i think you're becoming a... bridezilla.
what's fun about fire ants? they're-- oh, you're being sarcastic.
a rocket ship wedding cake -- just what i always wanted!
the score, damn you!
impossibly high. now, let's get started on the greatest daddy-daughter day ever! not even heated up. typical dog.
how would i know?
i'll save you, maggie! i'm telling! now what? aw, sweetie, you saved me. well, i promise that wherever you go in this world, i will always be there for you. oh maggie, i love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. god bless your mother for making you with me. whatcha watchin', honey?
look, man, i don't want any trouble. c'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. leave me alone, okay?
big deal! i could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.
i held up two, for "peely!"
hm. it feels like food. but it has no flavor whatsoever.
oh, come on, relax, i won't embarrass you.
wow, he's terrified of you.
aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?
sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the continental congress. dolphins swim in cliques. those are my two examples.
i see. well, maybe you're not ready for this book. it is more of a big girl thing.
attention parents, children and childless weirdoes. my son and i are going to build westminster abbey!
geoffrey chaucer?! what are you doing here?
whatever happened to "boo?"
that's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.
i can't understand that math reference, because i went to springfield elementary!
i'll take it!
the heat is off. the hissing from the radiator is a snake.
foam wasn't spilt in a day.
why can't i have it now? you got your present here. basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
sometimes i think this fifty square foot apartment isn't big enough for the both of us!
c'mon, boy! be cool!
you're not suggesting... murder.
"dammit, morpheus. not everyone believes what you believe."
why do they write a new review of this play every single day?
can you help me out? i need change for a dollar. oh, i also need a dollar.
time's up! okay, maggie: "suck, suck," that takes us to... me. some hollywood idiots hired me to star in a movie!
because i'm swallowing my frustrations and disappointments?
me using funny modes of transportation like a hot air balloon and a camel, and finally a pickup truck full of chickens? then i get out of the truck and go thank the driver, but then i see the driver is a chicken?
this life is the greatest. i get paid a fortune, i've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and i get to hire my friends.
well, one thing's for sure: i'm not everyman.
what happened is you left! who did you leave me for? tell me. i can take it.
i'm so cold.
when you say "teacher," do you really mean "parent?"
ask him.
it wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a bavarian castle!
watch your language, moron.
uh, moe, i have a confession to make: i'm just homer dressed as marge.
the math checks out!
then we must keep this boy safe from harm!
well, well, well. who's an unproductive worker now? got your nose.
help me or kill me!
or that we made a few adjustments to the soda machine...
...to a "p". spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks.
marge, would you mind if we just cuddle?
lemme try. "lick... eyes." um, i'll try again. "spank... hair." what the? "whisper into... ass." this game sucks!
i will! edamame?
hey ned. marge, i believe we have a little unfinished business. come with me!
finally, some peace and quiet. why do my actions have consequences?
lisa! lisa!
oooh.
point and shoot.
ooo, look! "congress of the crow!"
well, welcome, charlie! nice to meet ya! no glasses -- way to go! this one's a keeper!
do you guys know funky town?
no, i get my news off the internet.
what the?! well, he's more of a father to me than you've ever been.
marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? it's impossible. watch. why you little... oh, i can't. when i look at those beautiful chubby cheeks... c'mere, you. i'll kill you! you son-of-a--- don't look hurt. it's okay. it's okay. it's okay. i'll show grampa. i'll find my own surrogate father, full of heart-warming stories i can share with the world.
just with indifference.
none for me, marge. i get free donuts at work! i can see them now... in the break room, beside the fridge, the pink cardboard box awaits...
watch your language! now, why the hell not?
and you like potato...
songwriters who are stuck!
...yo no creía en fortunas, pero entonces me salió una galleta...
i'm alive! and surrounded by the...people i love the most in the... could you scooch over a bit?
i know. it's where i hide my adult magazines.
lenny... and carl... a fortune cookie... i ran into the candy machine... and i found an emerson, lake, and palmer...
do you think you could use someone like me in your band?
blackmail your father in space, will you?!
fine. let me just get my harness pads.
uh, yes, well, um... taxes took out a lot... i spent a ton on those things for the family... and um, i didn't know you could rent a balloon...
carl, you're a liar, but i love it.
how about bromance?
let us curl, m'lady. let us throw and sweep a'twain until the heavens themselves drop their jaws in wonder and envy! and afterwards there'll be beer, and cocoa, with marshmallows floating in the foam. and if, from now till the end of time, someone should ask what we were doing on the eve of the seventeenth of november, we shall proclaim that we were curling!
pack your winter coat! we're going to canada's warmest city!
uh-oh.
yeah, the simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few... alcoholics.
that's a great story, lisa! and you should stop reading right there.
leave me alone! i have shares to crop!
c'est la vie, baby.
hey! you're supposed to be doing your homework! no more tv for you! until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair.
no line... near the men's room... i see no reason to question your choice.
i was too! the words were in my brain!
whatever. knock yourself out.
i'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. lisa! you're a wonderful child! keep up the good work!
and when you're out of my sight, you must constantly twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though i don't know what twitter is and have no desire to find out.
talk to grampa. he used to be a man.
well, don't worry, boy. i know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls.
hey, my bathing suit came off!
a truckload of applesauce!
if you say it like dracula i will.
hey boy, we're supposed to be acting religiousy. what are you up to?
chickpea fizz.
pickle, carrot, tomato. pickle, carrot, tomato. pickle, carrot, tomato.
the dome of the rock? messiah, away! this one says "carolina panthers!" messiah says !
how 'bout a greg norman executive putter from the sky mall?
woo hoo! i'm drinking my salary!
okay, i will!
please tell me they suffered. g-g-g-g-hags!
well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation.
just my lunch. chicken parm, meatball parm, eggplant parm... shish ka-parm, angel food parm, moo goo gai parm... my wife can parm anything.
okay. ever been to moe's?
want some sugar?
no...
fine! i'll stay a little more.
i have an idea. but i must go alone. my car is filled with printer paper i stole from work.
no, ice cold.
a churro you can eat in the shower?
yup, i al-gored it pretty good. where's my grammy for audio book narration?
oh. well i'm not crawling back to big electricity! from now on, the simpsons are living intermittently.
be careful! if you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation.
marge, how hard can it be? we're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. it's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a mexican prison.
i'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! lisa, where were we?
you like sharks?
hey, i'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which i mean you.
i'll have to check it out sometime.
/ all right! all right! i'm goin' home. it's not safe in here.
oh no! i don't have to listen to you. if i'm not on camera, you can't see me!
you can help me take out those cameras.
sorry, honey. i wasn't listening. and i won't be listening now.
you're losing me? or you're leaving me?!
flanders?!
you take that back!
yeah, padre. how innocuous are your flashbacks?
you're not leaving me?
marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!
it's like you're a chinese empress!
yes, that's exactly the word i want to translate.
i wanted to, but your mother said kids might tease you.
okay.
uh, the long island ice teas?
i would kill for that.
did you say a hague?
fifty bucks each?! that's your life savings?!
sure, sure! let me just grab one more shrimp.
i wish. what the hell are you doing?!
yes! i mean no! i mean... you'll never get me! i have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right? initial there, and... never! can you tell me when this is gonna be on? i'm thinking of having a party.
woo hoo! underpants dinner!
...dislocating fosse's shoulder in a meaningless game... ...he had earned the nickname "charlie hustle..."
fine, i'll get the hook. don't fight it... that's it... that's it, a little more... how's that? you're safe now, my friend.
why do pie makers get all the girls?
ooh, got a text.
the pie you baked us killed that shark!
i know, i know. don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows frankenstein. it's racist somehow.
back off, you unholy dreamboat! pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.
no child of mine will go without anything, ever! except quality healthcare!
oh i'm sorry, maggie, but even at your age, i'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... i can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!
what is troubling you, my son? i mean, my girl son?
nothing, sweetie, nothing! here, let me explain. she does not want to... turn out like... you... didn't... not until... diplomatic... trapped... help... remember nothing!
oh, i've seen that look before. that's the "i ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years" look.
look what maggie got!
hell yeah!
don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end. where's the other girder?
did i? anyway, the bloody hangman set to his gory work. bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs.
you can race pigeons?
come on out, birdie! follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice.
oh baby! well whaddaya know! oh come on!
it was still too much.
hey, show some respect. three gingerbread workmen died making that. i'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go. you're gonna be okay. it's almost over. now to take care of the witnesses.
shut up.
now we just have to make it.
uh... uh...
c'mon, jus' one more drink, marge.
c'mon, lou. gimme a break!
it's okay, it's okay. i can be out in eighteen months with good behavior.
i can't go undercover with fat tony. he's met me. i've been in his house. i was briefly his consiglieri... consugly... canolli... robert duvall.
just get the ladle down there deep -- that's where the beaks are! hey, you're that guy from the f.b.--
can i have any of the steaks?
sorry, boss.
my neck is kind of itchy.
ayyyy!
so that's it! you used me to kill a man, and all i get is a handshake and a blanket?
fat tony?
are you gonna kill me now? 'cause i'm super ready.
okay let's see, number of dependents: three. um, add to line thirteen... hm, better check last year's return. hm.
sure, i'll stay home and skype with the guys at moe's.
right... neither am i.
oh no. i left a candy bar in my desk.
check out my tolerance, marge. i'm going to use the men's room. hey, i didn't know you were... uh... you know, one of those--
someday you'll understand that i'm just being a good dad.
well in that case, lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so i opened the drapes to let in more sun.
hmm, if this were a tv show that would be a helluva act break. but it could use a button. oh, what if i said... well if you...
and i love having you here, son. 'cause you can wake me up if somebody comes.
the boy's flash drive may be in there. but i've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.
drive my kids to school?! never! stupid double snuggler's hitch! only hope is to chew off my leg. ow! ow! huh, mmm, not bad. just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours.
you ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately?
deal!
is my job creating power, empowering?
that's it, boy! i'm eating your yogurt!
my little roman polanski!
there's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your "table read."
hey! don't you know it's awards season? who's calling you at five in the morning anyway?
you got your wish, boy. i'm proud of ya. i'm sorry i took all the credit.
uh, you look tense. let's discuss this over a cup of grampa's coffee.
nerd.
it better be tonsillitis.
cheech and chong are coming back to springfield?
then what did i just smoke?
dave?
how 'bout don johnson?
oh yeah, i getcha -- "work on the show." maybe we should start at four-twenty, right? marijuana reference!
hmm?
stop speaking spanish!
c'mon, if art garfunkle could forgive that untalented twerp paul simon, you can do this.
i'll be out here with you, dave.
all right!
well, this has been great. we should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting.
marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. has the joker taught you nothing?
now i have to work overtime--
i miss my friends from drunk driving school. they were so cool.
why didn't you tell me not to come?
i want you to know i'm cured.
all right. why you little... oh c'mon, now you're a tree?
oh, that's ridiculous. how could two people from the same family need therapy?
pretty sweet, eh boy?
let's see what else you've been hiding in there. i want my pot of gold!
boy that's good.
you are cruel but fair.
hm. so, should i bring a towel?
hey!
that's a wife ring? marge, don't look!
lady, i'm not a hairdresser -- i just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans. a hundred dollars?! marge, how much is that in smackaroos?
now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, i dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe i should open a hair salon.
oh?!
c'mon, bro, don't hassle me!
i'm afraid it's all too true. my wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser! another hairdresser?
fine.
well, it might have been the time when...
but there's so many buttons!
that doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. he could be a war hero.
oh, absolutely, ned. sorry. little help...
just the opposite of real life.
shut up.
i've got some bad news for you, marge. i'm actually not.
yeah, right. a baby shot a guy.
maybe i was a little hard on him, expecting him to be larry right away. by the way, where is larry?
i love you so much! potatoes and gravy on the side, please.
men's room? oh my god! we're completing each other's...
wayne, stop! that's mr. burns.
neh, they couldn't find a google map photo without me naked or urinating.
death to america!
cold. so cold.
paddles down! it's the only way to change the system!
bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse.
okay... i'm on the floor... i can't move... so far a normal sunday morning.
now, how would that work?
language.
that sucker soaks up flattery like a twinkie soaks up gravy.
woo hoo! oh, uh, if an emergency alarm goes off, there's earplugs in the top drawer!
since i got demoted i have to show my i.d., but the picture was taken so long ago i put on a lot of weight, so i have to stretch out my face and say "i used to look like this..."
i'm having problems with my new boss roz. she's the most evil person to come out of ohio since lebron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason.
congratulations, roz.
what is perception?
is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?
i need a nap!
marge, the kids are acting ethnic!
fine. blow off "fun dad," go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs.
hand me that saw, marge!
east oak street, is that it?
this better be dinner theater!
all right, you can each have one toy.
i demand to speak to my paleontologist!
we're taking down kids who read.
come on beautiful, i can't do the job without you, so what do you say?
okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!
woo-hoo!
but the trolls were the best part! do the characters still say "troll-y" instead of "cool?"
hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you.
...so he says, "bigamy is having one too many wives." to which i replied, "so's monogamy."
you know, you're kind of a downer. i thought you were retiring. why are you still here?
oh, well... i really should look at this picture a little longer. okay, let's go.
close enough.
you don't understand me. only she understands me. another round, kid? uh... i got here after you did.
i'll handle it. i always do.
well i, uh, found that contact lens i was missing. lemme just screw her back in. so, everybody good?
whose side are you on?
only the funniest black-and-white man ever!
would i!
are we done yet? "it's a wonderful life" is about to start. i wonder what my life would've been like if i'd never seen that movie...
too late! yeah, after i stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles. i'd smash 'em all for one lousy beer.
to prove a point. everyone thinks their dad's a jerk and everyone's right. but when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em. your dad may be a little immature, but i know he loves you, so you ought to give him a chance.
i just don't understand the world of grownups.
try to catch one on your tongue.
don't tread on pee! we probably have rights! airlines don't treat people like people anymore! you make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! and watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun! never putting me next to a pretty girl...
woo hoo! i'm famous again!
finally. but i want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated. welcome to "gut check with homer simpson"! where the truth is served, with a side of in your face!
just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an i.o.u.
i don't know. can't we get chris christie to run?
so, how come your picture's not on money?
congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes... no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other staaaate...
really? that made sense? then i'm definitely doing it.
u.s. of a! great song, ted. when's our next gig? are we goin' to new york, or--
marge, if you were married to da vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to da vinch.
aw, sweetie. hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?
then why did you say it?
that's better.
almost there, boy. almost there. almost there. i'm getting' closer. it's just within reach.
then why am i paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
two can play at that game. i can do this... i can do this... boy, i told you an hour ago. stop that!
wait! if you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought. i mean a thousand-year flood! i mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
we found a new home! when god shuts a door, he opens a window.
yep, i never realized how much i hated every single one of my friends and relatives.
excellent.
we hate opera!
let her slice off the tip of your ear, and she'll go right to sleep.
you know sweetie, there was a time when i would've killed for that information, but i'm pleased to announce i've already bought your mother a present.
friends are the only people you can betray! and you'd do it in a second for a supermarket that gives free coffee samples!
onnneee.
no backtalk! in the cage! now! get in there! son, do you have a minute? i've been thinking. i really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. so i'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
heard about this thing, boy?
you just ruined my car.
unguarded stuffff...!
a common misconception. suck it, karma! yeah! i'm talkin' to you, karma! karma's a bitch, karma!
so, i gotta know... do you guys forgive me?
hey, when you were pregnant everything was "we."
uh, marge, this is my friend keggy...
exactly like chandler, always criticizing.
goodbye.
woo hoo! thank god it's t.g.i.f!
what the-- section 1 of article 21 of the state constitution is amended to read: section 1. in the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of congress at the beginning of each decade, the legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of congressional, state senate and assembly districts. liquor... mustn't think of liquor...
crepes!
does the chair go back like this?
you're not a friend... you're my best friend. uh, just don't ask me to drive you to the airport.
what happened to you guys? you used to be cool.
i got it... i got it... i said i've got it!
i have some adjustments to make.
i'm doomed!
i'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
sure. what's your name?
keep 'em comin'!
ahhh. doesn't get any better than this.
the lava being! that's why they showed a clip of it on "previously on."
we've had stupider!
i'm sorry, sweetie. it's just a strandie discussion group. yes it is! we discuss why airplane go crash-crash, but people don't die-die.
why don't you talk to mrs. steak?
