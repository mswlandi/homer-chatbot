oh.
and?
hey, just because i don't care doesn't mean i don't understand.
me?
i don't think you realize what you're saying.
did you hear that, marge? she called me a baboon! the stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!
go away. lisa, don't hold anything back. you can tell me. are you crying because you called daddy a baboon?
nuts. this isn't going well at all.
no, no, no. i just wish i knew what to say. although, maybe this will help. now you lost someone special and it hurts. i'm lucky because i never lost anyone special to me. everyone special to me is under this roof.
oh.
i can hold these nails in place with my tail.
gimme a banana.
come on, you're holding out on me.
think nothing of it. hey, what's the matter, son?
hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?
would you have to do extra work?
and is this martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?
so, let the baby have his bottle, huh? that's my motto.
holy-moly... talk about parenting! uh oh. sleep well, maggie. ah, three for three.
up... up... up... up... up... up. don't say anything, marge. let's just go to bed. i'm on the biggest roll of my life.
i promised i wouldn't eat? never! you lie!
oh son, when you're older, you'll know better. hmmm. oh, baby! mmmm. yeah.
how do i look?
do we have enough gag ice cubs?
what are all our friends names again?
why not? i paid for it. hey, flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?
really? well i do have a warm sense of well-being and i seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! give me another.
no.
oh, dr. hibbert. enjoying the party?
it was me! you fell for it!
you little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?
bart, do that thing you do that's so cute.
that thing you know how to do.
go to bed. hey, everybody! look, i'm the funniest guy in the world!
i've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but i've never had the nerve.
you stink! you and your whole lousy operation stinks! i quit!
all right then. could you... give me a handful of peanuts... maude?
not those peanuts. the ones at the bottom.
why? what'd you do? marge!
where-where are we going?
the way i acted?
i put it there.
i slipped it into your glass as a gag.
i'm sorry, honey. can't we just forget it and go to church.
no, i didn't... i... oh, you mean inside, don't you?
i admit it. i didn't know when to say when. i'm sorry it happened and i just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
aw.
marge, marge.
sorry, reverend.
hmmmm.
oh, well, it's very tempting. really a wonderful idea. marge! what are you doing? are you insane?!
they're holding it at catfish lake. they couldn't call it catfish lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
oh dear. if we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. what a kick in the teeth.
no, you don't!
marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.
catfish lake.
wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. who's general sherman?
oh yeah.
whoa, who says that?
oh.
hmmmm. gentlemen: i am going to catch general sherman!
none of your business, flanders. uh say... uh... reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
oh.
i see. i also understand bowling expressions.
lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
ohhh, because i got drunk and looked down her dress.
she's perfect.
well, sometimes that can be annoying.
i'm done.
it's true. it's all true.
sorry.
i only did that a couple of times.
would this be a good time to be honest?
you're right, i am. help me, marge. what do i do to be a good guy?
marge, you don't know what this fish means. this fish represents a better life for both of us. this fish makes me a champion and a hero.
to those weirdos in the worm store.
well, if that's the way you feel... i'll throw it back.
watch. wow, i did it! i gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. i fought it for six hours. she says one word and i toss it back. and you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? come here, baby.
same as usual. perfectomundo.
i never knew what superman saw in her. give me wonder woman! and that golden lariat. she can tie me up any time.
i was just kidding, marge. hey, what does everyone say to dinner at krusty burger? my treat!
all right, what are you getting at?
a hundred bucks?! for a comic book? who drew it, micha-ma-langelo?
well, t.s.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no! now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, i give in, so i'm not mad at you for trying. it shows you've been paying attention. but we all know i'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. now are you gonna stop bugging me?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
are you?
hee hee, i win! in your face! yeah! how do you like them apples? woo hoo hoo!
bart! what are you staring at?
bart! stop it!
hey, what's all the -- my beer... my beer... my beautiful beer.
what's the problem, boy?
hey, when i was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.
nah.
son, i'm proud of you. i was twice your age before i figured that out.
they're fine.
joke's on them. if the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign.
i can't believe you guys. there's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. and you don't wanna cash in? that's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job.
sorry, sir.
marge! marge! what's my blood type?
aw, nuts! extremely rare blood and i don't have it.
earmuffs.
aw, old man burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some double-o-negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it.
woo! yes! all right! woo! congratulations, boy! you've got a date with a needle!
yeah, you have the right to remain silent.
yeah, probably. anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. and all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. so they got hercules, and hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave hercules this big thing of riches.
it was the olden days!
now let's get the show on the road.
eh.... the boy.
mr. burns... he's okay! jackpot!
it's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check.
"better half," marge. "better half."
marge, you're my wife and i love you very much. but you're living in a world of make-believe. with flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...
bart!
i promised my boy one simple thing: lots of riches. and that man broke my promise. well, i've had it! bart, take a letter. "dear mr. burns. i'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. and your caard was just great. in case you can't tell, i'm being sarcastic. you stink!" could you read that last part back to me?
good. "you are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."
an elephant's butt.
yup!
forget it, marge!
oh, all right. you always do that hand thing! and it usually works.
hmmm... oh, marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. y'know, i finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph.
where's the letter?
well, it's somewhere! it didn't just get up and walk away! bart, have you seen the letter?
all right, think very carefully. where did you see it last?
uh huh.
yeah...
why did you do that?
i'll show you mad in the morning.
she's right. okay, think, homer. don't panic. they don't pick up the mail till noon. there's still time!
locked, eh? well, i just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old mr. lock. step aside, boy.
what does it look like? i'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.
so a few people won't get a few letters. boo-hoo. you know the kinda letters people write: "dear somebody-you-never-heard-of... how is so-and-so? blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. yours truly, some bozo." big loss. now bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. just give me some kind of signal.
that's a good one. we'll use that.
uh, uh i-i guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?
well, i'm still gonna run!
i don't know. great plan, bart.
lisa, i don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry.
homer simpson.
yeah, well i'll be on my --
hey, c'mon, joey! do you have to twist my arm?
okay, here's the plan. you can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. and i'll... die in a gutter. it's practical and within our means.
i got my problems, moe. give me another one.
mr. burns, you brought us a present.
what did i tell you? i'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...
marge, what does it do?
marge! really, what does it do?
save a guy's life, and whattaya get? nothin'! worse than nothin'! just a big, scary rock.
wait a minute. if i hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!
exactly. it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
amen to that!
who stole my shirt? who stole my shirt?
oh thank you, marge -- pink? marge, i can't wear a pink shirt to work. everybody wears white shirts. i'm not popular enough to be different.
oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! oh no... pink. pink! pink! it's all over, marge. it's all over.
you! you did this to me!
mmm, thanks -- it looks... hey, wait a minute! just because i'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean i'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! although it is tempting --
you don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
print name?
all right, all right. i'll get lisa to do it. lisa, you like homework. could you fill out this form for me?
o-kay.
no deal.
son, it's no different than the time i let you vote for me. remember that absentee ballot?
look at him!
awww.
dog on fire! dog on fire!
yes, i'm hearing one right now, while i'm trying to watch tv.
bart! shut up or i'll shut you up!
that's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. they're gonna eat it.
arrghh!
who are you?
i'm homer simpson, from the simpsons.
oh, of course i've heard of you. i mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?
doesn't ring a bell.
what was that last one?
nope.
wow. how do you do that thing with your feet?
no, that thing with your feet.
because i wore a pink shirt.
what'd you wear?
bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--
okay. five times nine.
wowww.
hey, chief.
gee, i gotta call my family. oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. i mean, they think i'm a god.
oh great! and uh, try to put a good face on this. tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight.
that's all right, son.
what's that?
this place is so strange. mike, i'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but i'm... scared.
pancakes... football... boobies...
was the door locked?
was it raining?
were you out of gas? baby.
mmm... pancakes.
that's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. could i have it in writing, please?
not insane.
thanks a lot, michael. you really helped me get through this. if you ever find your marbles, come visit us.
you are? why?
now listen. i'm bringing michael jackson home to stay with us for a few days... isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice.
are you sure you're here voluntarily?
thanks everybody! it's great to be sane. here he is! here's the guy you wanna see.
huh? huh?
come off. i'm sane now.
not me. i got this.
oh yeah? well, what makes you so damn sure?
shut up.
marge, i never read a magazine in my life and i'm not gonna start now. hey, a cartoon. "well dear, you always wanted a compact." -- ain't it the truth.
oh, marge. cartoons don't have any deep meaning. they're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh.
nah, you go ahead.
as tolstoy said in "quotable notables," "give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."
marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. god forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds.
ooh... how about the "v"?
we're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival. then i heard the sound that all arctic explorers dread: the pitiless bark of the sea lion. he'll be killed!
don't be so... oh, you're right.
hmph?
that reminds me! "seven ways to spice up your marriage." marge, you have a nice body. and if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask.
where do you think? this baby never steers you wrong. and it was free. free!
wow! "win a trip to washington d.c."! "all expenses paid... vip tour"... oh. it's for kids.
ooh... and miss? just one more question --
sweetheart, there's nothing i wouldn't do for that magazine.
yeah! damn right!
uh-uh.
woo hoo! who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else i've got coming to me.
booooo!
wowww -- a shoehorn! just like in the movies! shoe goes on, shoe goes off. shoe goes on, shoe goes off. shoe goes on, shoe goes off.
stupid welcoming mint! y'ello.
wake-up call? it's two am!
free food?!
ooh! i love your magazine. my favorite section is "how to increase your word power." that thing is really, really, really good.
miss? what does the "i" stand for?
yeah, right.
lousy cheap country...
who's that?
bart, are you ready to go to... i'll room service you...
yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'.
gimme one of those!
give her the check! i was serious.
i'm almost done.
i'll be there. not-y not-y not.
well, why doesn't he just say so?
oh, here we go again. look, i don't care if ned flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. end of story.
excuse me? better? thanks a lot, marge, you really put me in my place.
don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. marge simpson... president of the international we love flanders fan club...
stupid flanders... always showing off. go ahead, marge, have a ball... what if they game back and i was dead from not eating? they'd cry their eyes out. we should have never gone to the flanders'. oh, why did we go to the flanders' house and leave homer all alone with no food. and i'd be laughing. laughing from my grave. what is it, boy? what? mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que. hey, everyone, i'm back! great to see ya! nice seein' ya!
the fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
that was a joke?
uh... sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
fun? where is this store, flanders? the merry old land of oz?
nah.
no, it isn't.
hmm, let's see. nah. hmmm. heyyyy.
keep your pants on, flanders! i'm wishing as fast as i can! ooooh.
oooh. that would be a shame. wouldn't it, flanders?
marge, tv gives so much and asks so little. it's a boy's best friend.
see, marge? you knock tv and then it helps you out. i think you owe somebody a little apology.
so, flanders, have you sold anything?
no, i do not know what schadenfreude is. please tell me, because i'm dying to know.
oh, come on, lisa. i'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. he's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... what's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?
boy, those germans have a word for everything.
yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks.
ooh, the touch of death.
hey, boy. how was class?
oh, that'll learn 'im.
hey flanders, when are your busy hours?
lousy. he just sits there all day. he'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
uh, well actually, moe...
homer simpson, sir.
can i leave, mr. burns?
but the note was asking you to --
um, mr. burns...
sorry, flanders.
hey, flanders. is everything okay?
oh, i get it. it's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! well, i wouldn't be caught dead buying this... hello!
i'll give you twenty bucks for it.
you were swindled, my friend. twenty bucks. take it or leave it.
sorry! no cash for neddie! homer keep all money! bye bye neddie! bye bye!
twenty dollars?
now i don't want it.
i changed my mind. it was a passing fancy. although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.
daddly-doodly.
only seventy-five beans!
oh, i know i need to pay them. but there's just so many.
flanders is in debt? are you sure?
uh, there's a store where...
yeah.
oh, flanders, i, uh, want to give you your stuff back.
you're gonna live in your car?
i know!
why not?
oh.
oh, it's all my fault.
yes it is.
no, i was a swine. listen, flanders, do you still have that store?
flanders, you open that store tomorrow!
i said do it! hello, jerry? homer simpson. remember last month, when i paid back that loan? well, now i need you to do a favor for me.
c'mon, you lefties. what'd i tell you?
it's all here, and it's all backwards. that's right.
to ned flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
hey, look what i got. a genuine official police badge... calling all cars... come out with your hands up!
that's officer homer. heh heh, heh, heh.
how much does it pay?
pfft. i make more than that.
... bart! have you started smoking?
don't lie to me boy. aha! cigarettes, just as i thought.
yeah, right. son... i'm gonna teach you a lesson. i'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. then maybe you'll learn...
son, i'll never doubt you again.
oh, all right.
you know if you need a hat check girl, i've got a daughter.
marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding.
wait till i get you home, boy.
well, not the leader... i mean... oh, it's true, it's true! all the pieces fit.
i thought he was dead.
hey, when do we get the check for this?
you know who the real crooks are? those sleazy hollywood producers.
hey, this is the only paper in america that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine.
what a movie. and that blonde cutie. does she have assets.
critical wha...? okay, okay, don't panic. whosever problem this is, i'm sure they know how to handle it. huh? ahhh!! it's my problem! we're doomed!!!
shut up! simpson, it's all up to you. it's showtime! okay, okay, think back to your training...
yes.
ooh, a side.
what?
yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it. this is all your fault! okay, gotta pick a button. pick a button. pick a button. uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... no, wait! bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? no, no!
eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... eenie meenie minee... moe.
hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. you just have to read the manual and press the right button.
magic johnson! y'ello.
yeah.
well, thank you.
uh, magic. what if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?
thanks, magic.
look, i get enough admiration and respect at work. i don't need it here at home.
it tastes so bitter. it's like ashes in my mouth!
what's your problem, boy?
that four-eyes with the big nose? you don't need friends like that.
what? what is it? what are you doing?
well, as long as it's quiet.
huh? wha?...
their eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
but i really can't tell them anything, sir.
what am i gonna do? what am i gonna do?
did it work?
um, grace under pressure is no...
whew! saved by the bell.
all right.
sure. moe.
you think it's him?
what are you talking about? of course he does.
we could have seen a monkey.
he's talking funny talk.
a jewish entertainer? get outta here.
mel brooks is jewish?
hey krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?
yeah, krusty, tell us.
why you little...
no, that's it. you've seen everything.
gladly.
hey, if you don't like it, go to russia.
hey, aren't you a little old for this? you're not even wearing costumes.
here you go, kids. lousy punks...
get a good haul this year?
i am very, very proud of you kids.
i'd like to see that.
eeuhgh. what is this thing?
oh yeah? how much?
c'mom pal, i don't wanna hear your life story. paw me!
why at that little shop, right over... there. oh no, wait, it was over there.
okay.
forget it, you two. as the pants- wearer of this house, i get the first wish.
marge, don't flake out on me. that monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true.
ooh, a luxury car. good baby. good maggie.
now you're talkin'!
woo hoo! c'mon, everybody. we're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!
come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. i thought he was just being colorful.
lisa, that was very selfish of you.
ok, ok. i'll make a wish that can't backfire. i wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, and...and! i don't want any zombie turkeys, i don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and i don't want any other weird surprises. you got it? hey... hmm. not bad. nice hot mustard... good bread... turkey's a little dry. the turkey's a little dry?! oh foul, accursed thing! what demon from the depths of hell created thee?!
yeah, but i gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... yeah, that's what it is. wanna try it? heh, heh, heh.
i wish i had a monkey's paw.
hiya bart!!! how's my boy! heh heh. heh heh.
it's good that you made that awful thing, bart. it's real good.
he gets it from your side of the family, you know. no monsters on my side.
shut up boy. if they make this field goal i win fifty bucks.
slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. end of monster. heh heh heh.
i'm not nodding. it's the air conditioning.
ouch! good night, son.
well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.
oh, ah, thanks boy.
i love you, son.
you both toilet-trained?
well, okay then... ... four o'clock... coupla hours i have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work.
huh? what?
for what?
how do you know i was sleeping?
camera?
how hard can it be?
ooo, what job is that?
sheesh. what a slave driver.
no. bart bit me.
i gotta go shake the dew off the lilly.
i didn't wake up. it's all a dream. it's just a dream!
umm. spaghetti.
oh, i hate having two heads.
don't worry, i know it's tonight.
uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
wow! and after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed.
hey, do i tell you how to do your job?
you know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top.
the moron next door closed early!
oh, me and my trenchant mouth.
okay, okay. but i want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. well i don't have one.
i'll have you know, i wrote it down. number four and a half -- stupid gum! number four and a half reed! whoo hoo!
i dunno.
no.
no.
no!... wait a minute. what was that last one again?
yeah! woo! woo! yeah!
i ordered it for my little girl. heh... heh.
that cost eighty-eight dollars!
look, i let you down and i apologize. i know that doesn't make it right, but i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
you didn't mean that!
no wonder she hates me. i never even noticed that she was alive.
okay. maybe i should just cut my losses, give up on lisa, and make a fresh start with maggie.
marge, if i spend any more time doing these girl things, i'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. no, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. let's see, quick fix, quick fix. ah, i'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for.
marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony.
marge, i've got to get her a pony. when i look in lisa's eyes, i don't see love anymore.
see, even when you yell at me, i can see love in your eyes.
ha ha, you love me.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
mm.
buh.
sneh.
excuse me, do you sell ponies?
"scot-tish deer-hound." hey, this is a dog!
half a million dollars?!
wow!
i'll take it!
uh, sure... let me write you a check.
is there a problem with that?
isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?
mr. burns, you do this personally?
u-su-ry?
i want to buy a pony.
no. i need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more.
sorry.
of course.
sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
because she stopped loving me.
i know you love me. so you don't get squat. hee hee hee hee.
i've got it all figured out. by day it will roam free around the neighborhood. and at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
that's for the courts to decide. marge, she loves me.
stable? that sounds expensive. this is what love costs a month?
oh nuts.
i was hoping it'd be money.
well you know, we're always buying maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have.
nah, we're not gonna be doing that.
first you didn't want me to get the pony. now, you want me to take it back. make up your mind.
marge, lisa loves me, the pony stays.
fine, i will. there's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it. do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?
liberty bell... two liberty bells... come on, come on, come on... oh. yes! whoo-hoo! three liberty bells! that'll be ten thousand dollars, apu.
thank you.
there it is.
no.
no! no!
no! you can't see... come on!
no! let go. you're ripping it.
ohh... i need money.
you're looking for help?
i'm your man!
woo-hoo!
...badge of honor.
but i eat... oh.
marge, could we go in the other room? i did something last night i'm not proud of and i don't want the kids to hear it.
mmm... salty.
no sir.
yes sir.
i don't know. how long do horses live?
thanks. when is she gonna stop loving me?
going for... eight hour walk.
coming right up, sir.
yes, sir.
yes i do. you see lisa, grownups have a thing called money...
you did?
oh no! what is it, a hippopotamus!
awww. apu. you can take this job and re-staff it!
that baby changed our lives.
oooooh! that's one clean tombstone.
in the garage.
yeah, give us a break, doctor.
if stuff starts flying, just turn your head.
okay, okay, calm down.
okay, i will. i will. patty, selma, what a pleasant surprise.
... expiration date: june, 1999... uh, 2012, yeah.
shh! they'll hear you.
i don't know. some guy i guess.
oh sure, great idea. i'd love to -- did you hear that?
how much?
what's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?
anything for my little girl. bart! you can't weld with such a little flame. stupid kid.
why? i just saw the best part. oooh, "death by knockout," "blood on the ice" oh, oh... "football's greatest injuries". lisa, we're going.
just grab something. all these movies are great.
oh great, you made me miss joe theisman.
oh marge.
uh, let's see, bart's friends... well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets.
okay. hank.
hank... jones.
steve mcqueen.
next.
well, he's always chewing on that phone cord.
then he has no hobbies.
bart!... bart!!!
you don't have any hobbies, do you boy?
well, that's what i... wait a minute. what are you doing?
oh, that's a hobby!
oh, my god. i don't know jack about my boy... i'm a bad father!
i'm also fat!
i'm homer simpson. i just took your test. i got a zero.
goodbye, son.
ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, i'm sold.
well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. how much do you see your son?
huh?
oh, how i envy you!
i've never been afraid of a little hard work.
what boy?
well, he is building a soapbox derby racer.
okay. no, i'm gonna do it.
but you can use me. i'm good. i've built a lot of things around the house... the spice rack... the birdfeeder... the gymboree. what was that? ah, who cares. son, please let me help you.
oh this isn't working at all. it's hopeless... wait a second. hmm... "cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: no matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite." huh? oh, that sounds too complicated. all right, i will! son, i don't think you should let me help you.
thank you, bill cosby, you saved the simpsons! you know, marge, that bart of ours is a little miracle. his winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... he reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit.
loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!
are you nervous son?
bart, the car had a few bugs in it, i admit that. but we're team simpson.
when did i ever teach you that?
don't be, no. go ahead, leave me. go on, go on and win. no, go on and win without your dad. i'll just sit here in "li'l lightnin'" -- which the simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, i had a son. ow.
why? what's wrong?
oh, sure, i'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. this is how you get your kicks, isn't it, lisa?
dr. hibbert, lisa needs a. you! homewrecker!
no!
i'm not pouting, you are.
sorry.
no. can't think of a thing.
leave me alone.
name your son's hobbies. building a soapbox racer... "name your child's friends." martin... martin! i'll curse that name 'til the day i die... huh? "who is your son's heroe?"... three-time soapbox derby champion ronnie beck! wow, i'm one question away from being a perfect father. "name another dad you talked to about parenting."
shut up flanders. flanders! flanders, flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?
great, thanks. i talked to flanders about parenting. i'm a perfect father. hold on, son, i'm-a coming!
do it for your old man, boy!
no, son, you earned it.
that's my boy. nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!
he's not so fat.
bart, why are you still up?
boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. sheesh, what an ego.
what is it, boy? is anything the matter, my son? talk to me, young man. say your name? why should i do that, my lad?
you spoke while you were jinxed so i get to punch you in the arm. sorry, it's the law. heh, heh.
run for it boy!
that's it. i'm outta here.
what's the matter, moe?
yeah, things are tough all over.
could i get a beer?
hey, i know a good drink. really hits the spot. i invented it myself...
as i stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, i knew i needed a drink. patty, selma, would you excuse me for a moment?
i don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.
a "flaming homer".
hey moe, you got any cough syrup?
try lighting it on fire.
well, it's called a "flaming...
moe, i haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. do you think my drink had something to do with it?
why yes i --
i'll tell you what's wrong. that rotten moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him! take that off this second!
nah... marge, i'm too upset to eat -- i think i'll go to moe's. .
i need to talk to moe.
i didn't even tell you my name.
homer simpson.
but--
barney?
you're my kid's teacher!
no!
get away from me. hey, moe?
i'd rather have a "flaming homer".
how could you do this to me, moe? this bar was going under and it was the drink i invented that saved it. if there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise.
business, eh? well let me tell you something. you just lost yourself a customer!
i said, you just lost yourself a customer!
you just lost yourself a customer.
you just lost yourself a customer, moe!
you just lost yourself a customer.
you just lost yourself a customer.
a beer?
can i have a clean glass?
oooh! look at me, i'm making people happy. i'm the magical man from happyland in a gum drop house on lollipop lane! oh, by the way, i was being sarcastic.
moe... moe... moe.
moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe...
fools! you poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your flaming moe's. all the time wondering, "how does he do it?" well, i'm going tell you. the secret ingredient is...
cough syrup. nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!
moe, sorry i lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
i guess so.
ahh. thanks, moe. you're the greatest friend a guy could ever have. hey, do you think aerosmith will be in tonight?
it's not fair!
uh-huh.
ooh, that's a lot of money. uh, mr. smithers, do you have change for a dollar?
homer simpson here.
i own stock?
so uh, how much did it go up?
yeah...
sure...
not any more...
that'd be great.
well... how are you?
uh-huh. so what's my stock up to?
what should i do?
sell! sell! sell! woo hoo! twenty-five dollars! ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer...
no, i'd like a bottle of henry k. duff's private reserve.
hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?
well, i happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars.
hey... hey!
you heard?
well, i'm afraid i had some great plans, too.
i spent it on beer.
fifty-two hundred dollars? what are you talking about? what? i sold it all for twenty-five bucks. ow!
did you buy this car with your stock money?
we could all lose our jobs.
well, they can't fire me.
cuz... i...
lucky drunks.
yeah! sock it to him, horst!
because we send them money?
oh, marge, i'm gonna be fired. i know it.
marge, it's not the money. my job is my identity. if i'm not a safety whatchamajigger, i'm nothing.
ooh, battlestar galactica. fit, damn you! fit! there.
huh? what?
no.
no!
auugghh!
uh... all of them?
i sure do!
well, ah, i wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy.
mmm. the land of chocolate...
la la la la la la...
oh, oh, oh. i'm sorry. we were talking about chocolate?
i think i did pretty good in there.
lousy german know-it-alls, who are they to say i'm not safe? oh what's the matter with this thing. no problems here.
i'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!
that's right. i lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars. let me ask you something. does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
okay, bad example. so let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?
and does it ever say, "i love you?"
nobody loves you. nobody loves you. you're old and you're ugly. nobody loves you. yea, yea, yea yea! nobody loves you...
na na na na / na na na na /
but marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe.
well, what color is it? blue or purple?
oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?
yeah, and i have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating i always get.
no, everything's fine. your mother uh, just, broke her leg.
maybe.
yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. for me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings.
yeah, but i have to hear about it.
actually, bart, i threw up more than your mother. ... it all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s.
yes, sir.
don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. lousy, ungrateful... can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh... where do you think you're going? you're gonna listen to my story. your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
you mean like will apes be our masters?
but it gives me time to think. well, girls i mean i mean boys. i, i mean you!
wow, what an ending? who'd have thought darth vader was luke skywalker's father. marge, you're as pretty as princess leia and as smart as yoda.
i'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy.
oh. well he's always happy. no, wait. he's always mad.
phew, good.
really? it must be the champale talking.
don't worry. this castle is impregnable!
why? what's wrong?
oh.
because it's the honorable thing to do?
marge, i... damn it, where's that card?
oh, i wrote down what i was gonna say on a card. stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket.
what's it say?
that's the card. give it here.
so... will you marry me?
woo hoo! woo hoo! yeah! she's gonna marry me. in your face, everybody... woo hoo!
you know, i had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago.
marge, we can't do that! all the kids'll call him larry fairy.
they'll call him screwy louie.
slob.
puke.
mucous.
let's see... bart, cart, dart, eeart... nope, can't see any problem with that. wow! i'll take that ring!
i don't know.
hey! this marriage is gonna last forever.
marge, i'm sorry. i wish i could afford a better place.
i am?
homer.
i do.
our first night together as man and wife.
hey, why don't i apply at the nuclear power plant? i hear they pay pretty well.
pfft. now you tell me.
... little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace.
there's a problem with the reactor?! we're all gonna die!!!
nah, they wanted someone good. story of my life.
wow! kid, i won't let you down. i swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job.
oh!
good evening, madame. you have been selected by the good people of slash-co to reap the benefits of their new nev-r-dull knife-edge. here... shake hands with the slash-co. handle first, handle first...
me! me! me! me! me! i said it first!
i don't know, i don't know --
"dear marge... by the time you read this, i will be gone. you deserve all the finest things in the world. and although i can give them to you, they will be repossessed and i will be hunted down like a dog. also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."
i will send you every cent i earn for the baby. but you will not see me again until i am a man.
oh, c'mon, honey. you know how it turns out. after all, you wouldn't be here today if i hadn't become the responsible head of a household.
okay.
wowww.
you want fries with that?
marge?
marge! holy cow, you're as big as a house.
no, marge, i just can't. i mean, look at me. i'm a trainee... they won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. but i can't buy you a decent wedding ring.
marge, for you.
oh, sure.
because i knocked you up?
you the boss?
you mean?
i got the job. i got the job! whoo hoo! only in america could i get a job!
the hospital?
thanks, mom.
shut up!
no, you listen! this is my wife and this is my kid, and i'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!
starting tomorrow, i'm a nuclear technician!
and tomorrow morning, i'm gonna buy your ring back! then i'm going house-hunting!
eh, somebody'll cover for me.
oh, college boy, eh?
hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me. ahh, bart. daddy's little angel. why you little... he did that on purpose!
yeah!!! whoa! excellent, marge!
mon-ey.
oh, sorry.
that could be bart!
he's in for some lovin'.
hm... bart's birthday's coming up.
limited?! do you have any of those microphones left?
bart, i'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. well, check out my present!
bart! i would love to get a present like that.
listen, boy, this is a great invention! watch. we got a great big con-voy / rockin' through the night / we got a great big con-voy / ain't she a beautiful sight / con-voy
hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!
mmmmm. chocolate.
why, you little... wait a minute. does this mean you like my present?
aww... just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
yeah, that timmy is a real hero.
well, he fell down a well... and can't get out...
well, it's more than you did!
you must think we're the worst parents in the world.
hey, don't make me come down there!
why, you little --
it's not our fault. we didn't want the boy, he was an accident.
uh, could you edit that last part out?
don't worry, you'll grow into it.
that's all i can stands, i can't stands no more. i'm gonna get you outta there myself.
shh! marge, he's a good digger.
don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again.
well, bye-bye belt.
pfft, my heart is just fine. a little beer will put out that fire.
whoo hoo! denver, yeah!
moe, i'd like to bet twenty dollars on denver.
twenty big ones on denver.
all right, denver. justify my love.
lousy, stupid denver.
why did you do that?
okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there. over. over... over... over... lisa, please, i can't hear the announcer.
why didn't you say that before!
oooh, that's a big lock all right. i just don't trust that guy.
huh, they both make a good case.
yeah!
line...
yeah, lay it on me, coach.
mm-hm.
cincinnati...
cincinnati.
cincinnati.
c'mon, c'mon! don't you realize this is costing me money?
doh, not the wind.
oh...
... miles per hour.
ugh, this is ridiculous. what am i supposed to do? lisa, who do you think's gonna win? the bengals or the dolphins? good, good. moe, fifty dollars on the miami dolphins.
all right, dolphins!
whoo-hoo!
fifty big ones!
uh-oh. you see, lisa, daddy's friend moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the dolphins won the game.
well, i wouldn't call it a bet. it's a little thing daddies do to make football more exciting.
well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?
and don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. crumbled up cookie things...
that's right. my god, it's like there's some kind of bond between us.
yeah!
you'd think that wouldn't you. but you see lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. even though they say it's okay in the bible.
uh... somewhere in the back. the point is we had a great time today. and to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. okay?
you bet.
me too, honey.
sure! you'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
all right!
what? didn't you hear what he said?
you think we should bet against them?
you got it. moe, twenty-three dollars on new york.
oh, sorry. so who do you like in the afternoon games?
my daughter, that's who!
lisa, you've picked the winner every time! you must have some kind of special gift.
oh, my little girl says the cutest things.
not sunday -- daddy-daughter day.
i used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. now it's the smell of victory.
tut-tut. only the best for my family.
hello, i'm homer. i'll be your customer.
oh, violin guy! what's your favorite song, lisa?
play on.
well, lisa, it's daddy-daughter day and daddy needs daughter's picks. you promised you wouldn't get mad!
good, good... you call moe.
barney, are you nuts? that's the super bowl. how about the sunday after that?
not quite. they were out of the malibu stacie lunar rovers.
boy, i know you're gonna like your present.
all right, marge. i'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad.
all right. if you must know, lisa and i have been gambling on pro football.
but marge, she never loses. she's got a gift. aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?
only in forty-eight states. besides, it's a victimless crime. the only victim is moe, heh, heh, heh. and it's brought lisa and me together.
look, what's the problem? the kids are happy, you smell like meryl streep, and i've got that foot massager i've always wanted. believe me, marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this.
well, that sounds great honey, but next sunday i'm going bowling with barney.
don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away.
look lisa, honey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings. but i really had a good time watching football with you. and i think you had a good time with me.
well, c'mon, we can still watch the super bowl together. can't we? eh? huh?
it's a date! so... do you think the cowboys will beat the spread?
okay.
dallas! whoo-hoo!
however? what however? what do you mean, however? however what?
lisa, do me a favor. complete this sentence: "daddy should bet all his money on..."
oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. i gotta get outta here.
don't worry, moe. i'm not bettin'.
buffalo's gonna win. lisa hates me!
my daughter.
not duff dry... dallas.
huh?
all right, we're back in business.
please, please, please...
money comes and money goes, but what i have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!
it's beautiful.
after i catch my breath... can we... go... home?
marge, i split my pants again. oooh, can i have two sandwiches today? make them bologna sandwiches too. can i have two slices of bologna and cheese...
marge, can you take my ball to nick's today? a bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole.
alley balls?
alley balls...
hello? hello? is this thing on? hello?
what should i say?
yes it's me!
i love you very much. and uh... later tonight i think you and i should uh, snuggle.
look marge, i can tell something's bothering you. but if you come out of that car, i promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. please, honey?
whaa...
what? but marge, we just had a vacation. remember mystic caverns?
i know you do, marge. but come on, you know what our vacations are like. those three monsters in the back seat. "are we there yet? are we there yet?" and let's face it, i'm no day at the beach either. "marge, can i have another sandwich? marge, can i have another sandwich?"
what? you mean we're getting a divorce? marge, i can change!
well, okay. but you have to swear you're comin' back.
all right then.
she's startin' to give.
for your information, i can take care of my -- see? got her on the first bounce.
good bye? where's my clean underwear?
how often should i change maggie?
marge, marge, how do i use the pressure cooker?
c'mon, maggie. nummy, nummy num. mmm. strained peas. let go!
all right, but just be careful.
barney, i've lost the baby. it's the worst thing i've ever done.
just help me look!
c'mon!
barney! you're gonna pull her arm off.
i came to see the kids.
hmmm.
hey kids... uh... you haven't seen maggie around anyplace have you?
well, i gotta go.
oh. well, i've got good news for you. the dog didn't run away.
yes.
uh... she's small... she's a girl...
oh maggie!
you found my baby. oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
you got it, sweetheart. you have enough blanket there?
marge, dogs love the outdoors.
yeah, but what're ya gonna do?
marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers.
yes you are. you've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on tv. i know, i'll build him a dog house.
don't worry. i just drew up a little blueprint. now let me walk you through it. this is the door. he goes through that. this is the roof. and this happy character here is the sun. he shines down on the house, see.
stupid lumber... dammit! son of a -- the hell with this!
"maybe it's the beer talking, marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. they got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? get outta here."
damn, crappy nails! super glue my butt!
what is it, flanders?
look, if this is about your camcorder -- i lost it, okay?
what the hell are you talking about?
oh come on now, flanders, i don't complain about your your... moustache.
makes you look like you've got something to hide.
people are talking... lots of people.
aye-aye! admiral butthead.
well what a surprise. marge sticks up for flanders! can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, ned flanders?
look, we're past that. marge, maybe i do curse a little, but that's the way god made me. and i'm too old to stop now.
well marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. bring on the swear jar. do i have to pay if i hit my hand with the hammer?
what if i catch on fire?
what if i see something really weird in the sky?
what about when we snuggle?
god -- ohh, you son-of-a.
you dirty bas... what do ya think, lisa?
well, he just goes... ohhh
where'd you get the money?
maggie. oh. cute.
beer! how did you know?
bart, this is your teacher? i should start going to parents night.
boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth.
oh, marge. i only said it because i thought that's what you wanted to hear.
step aside everyone. sensitive love letters are my specialty. "dear baby, welcome to dumpville. population: you."
i may hold you to that, marge.
three simple words. i am gay.
p.s. -- i am gay.
how about, "with a love that will echo through the ages?"
why you little...
don't tell me how to eat donuts --
softball? who's next? what's the matter with you guys?
look, i know it wasn't our best season.
well, this year's gonna be different.
it's something very special. a home-made bat. it all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when i locked myself out of the house... sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, i ran for cover under the tallest tree i could find. something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that i could make a bat out of. i put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
and here it is.
let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
check it out, boys. my magic bat.
yeah, just watch. woo hoooooo! ha ha. cops can't win!
kids, kids, kids. you can each get me a beer. but first let's see it again in super slow motion.
you're darryl strawberry.
you play right field.
i play right field too.
well, are you better than me?
marge, forget it. he's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than i do.
well now that you're a little bit older, i can tell you that's a crock. no matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you.
i got it! i got it!
hey, i called for that!
no.
these guys aren't so tough. i've got "wonder bat."
please, please, please, i want to make the team. clemens, did i make the team?
like what?
yeah, but none of my friends can watch me.
no, no, no! i don't want you to see me sitting on my butt.
they're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me.
i am? whoo-hoo!
yes.
uh uh.
got it.
yes, sir!
huh?
good one, lenny.
so what're you gonna be, boy?
no, the army said i was too heavy. the police said i was too dumb.
wait a minute. isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?
look, i didn't steal that copper wire. i just thought they were throwing it out. here, take it.
good for you. maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
we always have one good kid and one lousy kid. why can't both our kids be good?
maaarge... the dog doesn't count as a kid.
oh yeah.
one hundred and thirty million dollars!
bart, i need some lucky numbers, fast! how old are you? uh-huh, and what's your birthday? no kidding. and what's lisa's birthday?... what? you don't know your sister's birthday? what kind of brother are you?
i know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. go-get-all-your-money...
you don't understand, marge. the lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. uh, the lottery and you.
yes, money... i mean honey. ooooh! here comes a news report about the lottery! hey, down in front.
whoo-hoo!
correction. three hundred and eighty million to fifty. so what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?
what do kids know about spending money?
hmm...
look closer, lenny!
fourteen carat gold!
receipts, ugh.
well why didn't you tell the rest of us? why did you keep it a secret??? if you were seventeen, we'd be rich! but no! you had to be "10."
dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not.
hey, you did the best you could.
well... i guess we'll have to talk it over.
uh... later. first, i want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... doggie heaven.
well... of course. there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
uh... hitler's dog... and that dog nixon had... whassisname... uh... chester.
yeah. and one of the lassies is in there too. the mean one. the one that mauled timmy.
but it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach... oh, come on! i'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. marge, make him stop.
i know you're a good man... and i have a dog that's very sick...
i thought maybe you... oh. well, thanks for your time.
what?
but marge! it looks so easy! just like carving a turkey. maybe you're right, marge.
