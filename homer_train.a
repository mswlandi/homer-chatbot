mr. bergstrom left today.
he's gone. forever.
i didn't think you'd understand.
i'm glad i'm not crying because i would hate for you to think that what i'm about to say is based on emotion. but you, sir, are a baboon!
whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. i just can't believe it was her.
homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. there's a little girl upstairs who needs you. her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her daddy.
no!
look, if you just want me to forgive you --
yeah.
you're so silly.
i don't have any banana.
i'm sorry i called you a baboon, dad.
no.
yeah.
well, no.
hey! thanks, monkey-man.
homer! you promised!
yeah, you can't have any fun in bed.
oh! they're here! how does everything look?
do we have enough glasses?
hey, homer! care to try some of my flanders planters punch?
au contraire, simpson! it has three shots of rum, a jigger of bourbon and just little dab-a-roo of creme de cassis for flavor.
now, homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. remember last year at the winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?
hi! you're homer's sister-in-law, right? i remember you, but i don't remember you being so beau --tiful. ow! hey! jeez! is that a new kind of mace? it's really painful.
what?
yes sir.
what?
what?
homer, i don't know you. my wife and your wife are friends. we met just three hours ago.
uh, gee homer, don't quit...
oh sure.
i have never been so embarrassed in my life.
homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?
good lord! there's a fly in my drink!
you did?
homer, i like to think that i'm a patient, tolerant woman, and that there was no line you could cross that could make me stop loving you. but last night, you didn't just cross that line, you threw up on it!
i understand why. you were wasted.
dad, i have as much respect for you as i ever did or ever will.
now before i give you all a sneak preview of next week's sermon, i have some announcements to make. we have some new pamphlets available in our church newsrack including "bible bafflers", "satan's boners," "good grief! more satan's boners" and, for the teens, "it's not cool to fry in hell."
i'm sorry. the lord and i can't compete with the squeaking of homer simpson's shoes. why don't we just put everything on hold until he takes a seat?
will the simpsons be attending our little retreat?
now you wanna go?
oh my. where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
don't take that tone with me, young lady, or i'll give you a taste of the back of me hand.
where ya headed?
oh, after general sherman, are ya?
he's only the biggest catfish in these parts...
... they say he weighs upwards of five hundred pounds.
now, that there's the only known picture of the general. can't see what he is, exactly. he's freakishly big, though.
why, homer simpson! here to give your marriage a little spit shine?
oh, i'm afraid not. a marriage can't be reconciled in a few hours, homer. it takes a whole weekend to do that.
we must bait our hooks with honesty. that way a happy marriage won't be the one that got away.
homer, why are you here?
no, no, homer. marge is going to tell us all your faults. why don't you tell us about hers?
come on, homer. what are her faults?
now, marge. don't interrupt. you'll get your turn.
homer, don't interrupt.
he blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle...
homer, you're sneaking out to go fishing? i can't believe your selfishness. you can go fishing anytime, but we're here trying to save our marriage. you're thinking about fishing, even when i'm talking... right now. right?
yes.
to who?
all this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
oh yeah, sure.
how's your marriage?
homer!
all right, homer. whoa, you really are a sport, dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger!
i need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
oh please, dad. i want this more than anything in the world.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
please dad.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
no.
okay.
get a job! were they serious? i didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away... forever.
so long, officers. uh-oh.
moon pies, my butt... somebody oughta moon pie her...
i've been bustin' my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all i got was fifty cents.
really?
homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?
ah, chief wiggum, archbishop mcgee, distinguished guests. i am pleased to dedicate this emergency warning system. in the uh, off chance of a nuclear disaster, this sign will tell you, the good citizens of springfield, what to do.
i don't wanna.
you know, homer, i am your supervisor.
a-positive.
sixteen permanent, eight baby.
glow in the dark monster make-up. oh, homie, you have lots of hair... why did you want to know your blood type?
bart does.
is it a bible story?
how did a lion get rich?
oh yeah! during the day, all my friends are in school, so i got a job as a certified bloodletting tech dude.
homer, brave young bart. i don't know which one to hug first.
yes, dad.
the meaning of what?
homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand.
yeah, mom. we got hosed!
you stink.
an elephant's butt?
but he's your boss. do you have to mail it right this minute?
you're still angry, homer. why don't you sleep on it?
homer... breakfast is ready.
oh... thank you.
homer, i don't think it's in the cornstarch canister.
yup.
...was in my hand...
...as i was shoving it into the mailbox.
dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. and i know you. you're an emotional guy. just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. so i...
homer, you encouraged him. you should be strangling yourself.
why the hose, homer?
yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?
dad, the mailman is here.
dear god! are you planning to water the mail?
okay, mr. burns. what's your first name?
ooh, look, maggie, what is that? do-dec-ah-edron. dodecahedron.
oh, don't be frightened of this. it's nothing but a letter opener. who are you?
simpson, eh? simpson. oh, why, there's a letter here from you. i'll just read it right now. "dear mr. burns. i'm so glad you enjoyed my son's blood. and your card was just great." why, simpson. you've made my day. you're a true gentleman.
honey, what's done is done. no matter what happens, we'll pull through. we always do.
hold on, i'll check. mike rotch. mike rotch. hey, has anybody seen mike rotch, lately? listen you little puke. one of these days i'm gonna catch you, and i'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick. what's the matter homer? you're not your normal effervescent self.
wait, dad, he's smiling.
it's to open the crate, stupid.
it doesn't do anything.
sir, you're my god of generosity.
well then, i guess the moral is, "no good deed goes unrewarded."
perhaps there is no moral to this story.
i tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
i washed it.
now homer, don't panic. you have plenty of white shirts.
ah, my lucky red hat. clean as a whistle!
let's go, pinky.
well, monty, it used to be that establishing a patient's sanity took months. that's all changed, thanks to the "marvin monroe take home personality test." twenty simple questions that will determine just how crazy or meshuggenah, someone is.
homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. i can't fill this out for you.
well, all right -- if you listen to the poem i just wrote.
dad, maybe you should do this.
dog on fire. ruff! anybody order a hot dog?
and finally, "baby with a nail gun."
okay, it's time to cast your votes now.
yes. "are you quick to anger?"
right...
good...
put him in with the big white guy who thinks he's a little black guy.
i can't believe you've never heard of me. i'm a very popular entertainer.
michael jackson.
thriller?
thriller.
the moonwalk?
hee hee hee... you seem like a nice guy. why'd they put you in here?
i understand. people thought i was crazy for the way i dressed.
one white glove, covered with rhinestones.
forty-five.
we call this guy the chief. he's been here since 1968. never says a word, never moves a muscle.
hello. well, it's about time somebody reach out to me.
i could call them for you.
forget it, pal, there's only one way out of here and it ain't pretty.
what's wrong, homer?
we all get scared once in a while. maybe i can help you. homer, the two of us need look no more / we both found what we were looking for / with a friend to call my own / i'll never be alone / and you my friend will see / you've got a friend in me.
okay, so i was working at an insurance company, right? huh! youngest vp in the history of the firm. okay? the job was my life. then one monday morning, i got up and i couldn't leave the house. i just couldn't.
thank you. anyway, that day i knew i-i just couldn't make that long drive to work.
you mean there really is a bart? good lord!
mr. simpson, after talking to your wife, we believe you're no threat to yourself or others.
of course.
well, how about today? i'm only here voluntarily.
homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose.
um homer, i'm a vegetarian. and i don't drink.
and the guy in the pink shirt is the father of the family who, it turns out, was just released from a mental hospital.
i thought so. oh, bart, you...
this is my real voice. my name is leon kompowski and i'm a brick layer from patterson, new jersey. all my life i was very angry until one day i just talked like this. all of a sudden everybody was smiling at me, and i was only doin' good on this earth, so i kept on doin' it. to make a tired point. which one of us is truly crazy?
mr. simpson, i can assure you this "check" of yours is non-negotiable.
you see where it says "void-void-void" and "this is not a check"? "cash value one twentieth of a cent"? "mr. banker, do not honor."
no, it is not the truth, homer. it's well documented that women are safer drivers than men.
hey, einstein. put down your readin', it's lunchtime.
hey, you don't wanna eat? what'd ya do, get one of them stomach staples?
but irrigation can save your people, chief smiling bear.
hey, what gives, man?
homer, he obviously got out alive if he wrote the article.
homie... put down your magazine for a minute...
i thought you might want to snuggle.
it certainly has enriched our lives.
very.
thanks for driving me to the contest, dad.
"so burn the flag if you must. but before you do, you'd better burn a few other things. you better burn your shirt and your pants. be sure to burn your tv and car. oh yes, and don't forget to burn your house. because none of those things could exist without six white stripes, seven red stripes, and a hell of a lotta stars." thank you very much.
could you touch your nose for me? lisa, after meeting your father, i've decided to award you an additional five points. congratulations. you and your family are going to washington!
yes, sir. can i get you something?
oooh, look, homer. the irs.
homer, look! they give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow.
good morning. this is your wake-up call.
sorry fatso.
lisa? i'm faith crowley, patriotism editor of reading digest.
these are special vip badges. they'll get you into places other tourists never see.
folks, we print more than eighteen million bills a day. oh, and in case you were wondering... no we, we don't give out free samples.
i'm too excited to sleep. anyone up for the winifred beecher howe memorial?
thank you!
lisa, what's gotten into you?
miss crowley, thank you for this over-sized novelty check. i would like to share this honor with all of my fellow essayists. particularly the courageous lisa simpson, whose inflammatory rhetoric reminded us that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
why homer, you silly goose! the weed whacker's just for the edges! you're gonna be out here all day!
you are a picture and a half! well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. we're gonna fire up old propane elaine and put the heat to the meat! nummy nummy num!
i think it means he's having a barbecue.
we can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --
oh, homer.
and so the saskatchewan rough riders, who scored only four rouges all last season, jack, get the kicker they so sorely need...
you lie like a fly with a booger in its eye.
well sir, like one out of every nine americans, i'm left-handed. and let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. your writing gets smeared. lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission. well sir, i'm opening a one-stop store for southpaws. everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. i'm gonna call it the leftorium. so homer, i'm dyin' to know. what do you think of the leftorium?
well, i know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too.
oh, here, you two. make a wish.
it's fun.
come on, homer! i got an ambition to do some wishin'!
no, no, no, don't say. otherwise it won't come true.
yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
that sounds fine, bart.
dad, do you know what schadenfreude is?
it's the german term for "shameful joy" -- taking pleasure in the suffering of others.
sour grapes.
so bart, what did you learn in karate school today?
uh-oh. gotta get back to karate class. you missed a spot. all right. comin' through. outta my way. move it along. step aside, lady.
today we learned how to rip a man's heart out and show it to him before he dies.
pinking shears? let's go to the food court and steal some baked potatoes.
hey homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?
ah! look, smithers, another member of our nuclear family, with some helpful suggestions. and what's your name?
oh! it's a real one! "no more apples in the vending machine, please." well, that's almost a sentence!
oh, of course. and don't worry, there'll be plenty of apples for you. nobody will take away your precious apples.
now, now, now. tell my secretary i said you could have a free apple. she'll make everything all right, i promise. damned infernal gizmo. my kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
hey, i'm flexible! you don't have to pay all at once. i'll be here all night if you change your mind.
oh, yeah. sure. thought i'd just get rid of some of the clutter. see anything you like?
ah, got your eye on the gas grill. she's a butane beaut.
twenty? homer, i paid three hundred dollars for this just last year.
all right, homer.
twenty dollars.
what?
sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old daddly-doodly.
good afternoon, sir, i'm chuck ellis from the springfield collection agency, and i'm here to ask you why you don't think you need to pay your bills.
oh.
we don't make mistakes. damn right-handed ledgers... can't write in these things...
hey, you said you're homer simpson?
well, there's no house to put it in, homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up.
listen to that singing... those poor fools. homer, i'm ruined.
you know at times like these, i-i used to turn to the bible and find solace. but even the good book can't help me now.
i sold it to you for seven cents.
no it's not.
no! you tried to warn me about gambling my family's future on some pig in a poke... i didn't listen. homer, you were a true friend.
for two more days. then it becomes libertarian party headquarters. i hope they have better luck than i did.
oh, homer, there's no point...
homer?
homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. but you made us friends.
no one wants your stupid police badge, bart.
hey, that's my badge, homer.
thirty bucks a week.
good for you, chief.
no.
they're not mine. my boss said his warehouse was full.
homer, i want you to go down to that club and talk to them. just see what kind of people they are. please, homie?
i am thrilled you've decided to let your boy continue to work here.
homer, what did you find out?
oh, bart. why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys.
principal skinner!
cool!
well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us.
dad, i think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and larry king.
five minutes before critical mass.
one minute to core meltdown.
now homer, this may very well save your life one day. this, homer...
please pay attention. this button here controls the emergency override circuit. in the event of a meltdown, push this button and only this button.
do you see which button i'm pushing?
fifteen seconds to core meltdown.
yeah, we owe you one.
simpson -- monty burns. come with me. now, now. that will do. homer, for your bravery and skill, we award you this ham, this plaque, this discount coupon book, and my own personal thumbs up! and to insure your immortality, your heroic visage will be added to our wall of fame... oh, and uh, what's this? a congratulatory phone call from earvin "magic" johnson.
wow. homer, i just used our last time out to call and congratulate you on diverting that nuclear holocaust.
i don't care.
don't worry. sooner or later people like that are exposed as the frauds they are.
a role model in my very own home. how convenient.
maybe you ate a clove.
i had a fight with milhouse.
how zen.
looking at you with quiet awe.
they've lost their zest for work. you must help them find their eanae-eharatou-nah-duleve!
we want you to give them a pep talk that turns them from a bunch of donut-eating goof-offs into a pack of homer simpsons.
he's just a little nervous. he has to give a speech tomorrow on "how to keep cool in a crisis."
hey, i had to give a speech once. i was pretty nervous, so i used a little trick. i pictured everyone in their underwear. the judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.
three minutes to meltdown.
just do what you did before.
thank you homer for saving my plant with that idiotic rhyming. do you even know what button you pushed?
god bless that clown.
ohh, that's a relief. go wait in the car.
well, alright. i'm a little rusty, but um, i'll try. baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz.
no, dad, that's hebrew. krusty must be jewish.
dad, there are many prominent jewish entertainers including lauren bacall, dinah shore, william shatner, and mel brooks.
come on...
don't worry, i don't even like using the bathroom after you.
do you have any yearbooks?
homer, maybe you better take milhouse home.
trick or treat, man.
hand over the candy, old dude, or we egg your house back to the stone age.
we're home!
heh heh heh...jackpot!
i can do that but i don't wanna.
it is a monkey's paw, dating back to allal ben abdallah. it has the power to grant wishes to its owner.
sir, i must strongly advise you do not purchase this. behind every wish lurks grave misfortune. i myself was once president of algeria...
ugghh, homer. where did you get that ugly thing?
peace on earth.
homer, there's something i don't like about that severed hand.
oh, my land!
okay, no more fooling around. paw, this is bart. i wish for the simpsons to be rich and famous.
oh homer, this is awful.
i wish for world peace.
jeez, now we're slaves. this paw sucks.
hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?
good morning, dear.
much better! oh good, the curtains are on fire!
okay.
i want to watch krusty.
homer, i see you agree with my theory.
well that's too bad because the attention the boy craves should be coming from you. i want you to spend some quality time with him. get to know him. maybe even love him.
good night, dad. you know, these last few days have been really swell. i wish there was something i could do to repay you.
you got it.
can we sleep with you?
yes!
attention homer simpson. attention homer simpson. wake up, homer.
you're fired.
we've been watching you on the surveillance camera.
hey, here's a good job, dad. oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor.
hey, dad. here's one. twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people.
deeper. wider. faster. i wouldn't bury me turtle in that mud puddle. ah, what's the use?
hey, man, you were crushing me. i tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.
perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? well my body was crushed so i had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
don't forget dad, tonight my class is having an all you can eat spaghetti dinner.
but homer, tonight's our reception for queen beatrice of the netherlands.
no. dad, i broke my last saxophone reed, and i need you to get me a new one.
i called her. she's not home. i also tried mr. flanders, aunt patty, aunt selma, dr. hibbert, reverend lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement.
why don't you go there first?
sorry, homer.
i happen to be that moron.
let me think about it... eh... no.
okay. okay. but now we're even. so what does your daughter need?
uh-huh. and what instrument does she play?
oboe?
saxophone?
oh yes, of course. it's the reed. let's hear it for lisa simpson and her wacky sax.
okay, who ordered the mount bellyache?
i'm sorry dad, i don't feel much like eating.
i forgive you.
did you hear that, homer?
homer, if you want to make up with lisa just spend some time with her.
we can't afford to buy a pony.
that's ridiculous.
that's no reason to buy a pony!
stick to the subject.
you sound like you're going to buy a pony. promise me you won't.
what was that? was that a yes or a no?
those aren't even words!
oh my, what is that smell? oh, it's you.
very good. that stunning creature over there is half a million dollars.
he was sired by seattle slew and his mother won the kentucky derby.
his likeness graces a stamp in tanzania...
mr. simpson, do you have half a million dollars?
our ponies start at five thousand dollars. cash.
simpson, eh? how can i help you?
it's a hobby. i'm not in this for any personal gain, heavens no. by the way, are you acquainted with our state's stringent usury laws?
silly me, i must have just made up a word that doesn't exist. now, what is the purpose of this loan?
shut up, simpson.
mr. simpson, are you quite sure you know how to take care of a pony?
i am very upset with you.
hey, how come lisa gets a pony?
homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?
that's illegal.
dad, i think princess belongs in a stable.
father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived.
hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. we're just going to have to cut down on luxuries.
actually, i was thinking we could cut down on your beer.
then i'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
homer...
here you go.
oh congratulations, mr. homer!
if i could just see the ticket...
please to be removing your thumb.
i've got to look at the ticket
yes, i must...
a cherry! oh, mr. homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery?
well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my "help wanted" sign.
you're hired.
i won't lie to you. on this job you will be shot at. each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor.
here's a pointer: try to take it in the shoulder. now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. they are strictly ornamental. there's only one bozo who comes in and buys them.
homer, where have you been? i was so worried.
homer, are you stealing squishees?
homer! you are asleep at your post! now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.
homie, how long do you plan to do this?
i just called to say i love you, dad.
hey, pink hat, when i ordered that blueberry squishee, i meant today.
and fill it to the top this time.
dad, you don't have to do this.
dad, i understand the sacrifice you've made for me. that's why i gave up the pony.
i mean you, you dummy.
products you could only imagine before. the foam doam...the jet walker...mr. sugar cube...
troy, i've brought with me the gravestone of author and troubled soul edgar allan poe. yes, but unfortunately, a century of neglect has turned this tombstone into a depressing eyesore. not so fast troy! with one application of spiffy, you'll think the body's still warm.
hey, dad, you got a power drill?
hey, homer, i can't find the safety goggles for the power saw.
okay. i'll throw in a fourth bottle, the applicator glove, and a state of kansas jell-o mold -- twenty-nine ninety-five.
homer, be nice.
no, next to him. mary... tyler... moore.
who's using the power tools?
well, we're going to the beauty parlor. maybe you should do something with the kids while i'm gone.
yes.
everything.
you want to rent it, sir?
but, dad, i can't find "happy little elves in tinkly winkly town".
homer, could you turn off the tv? there's a little test i want you to take.
this is from the national fatherhood institute. it evaluates your knowledge of your son and rates you as a father.
they want a name, homer, not a vague description.
hank?! hank who?
homer, you made that up. question two: "who is your son's hero?"
that's your hero. "name another dad you talked to about parenting."
he hasn't done that since he was two.
oh really? well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see.
what?
no, not really.
hey, so it is.
you're also fat.
national fatherhood institute. dave speaking.
in between some other projects. well, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, i've booked some time at the wind tunnel.
mr. simpson, if you want to be a good father, you have to spend time with your son.
why don't you ask him yourself? homer, meet dave jr.
thanks, dad.
homer, that easy back and forth that you just witnessed didn't happen over night. it took years of effort.
your son. find something he likes to do and share in it.
thanks, but i'm almost done. why don't you get back on the couch and watch tv?
sorry dad, but three time soap box derby champion ronnie beck never needed his dad's help.
come on dad, it'd be weird.
fine. hey, simpson, where's your loser-mobile?
you didn't hear nothin'.
dad... i don't know how to say this, but i don't want to drive your car. it's slow, it's ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...
dad, i love you, but you taught me to win.
dad, can you take me to dr. hibbert's office?
oh, nothing. i just scheduled a tetanus booster. maybe i'm being a little anal, but barefoot season's coming up and there's a world of rusty nails out there.
tell me something i don't know.
dad, aren't you coming?
dad, you gotta come. i just got your hat out of the fridge.
don't you at least have something to say to bart?
but i guess i was wrong. you are a bad father.
good morning, everybody, and welcome to an event that harkens back to the carefree days of the great depression -- the soapbox derby. in just minutes, these junior al unser juniors will lock horns.
well sir, there are two schools of thought...
forget about your father. you're driving for me now!
thanks, mr. beck. i was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... this is for you, dad.
mom, i never won before. i may never win again. nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
whoa, t and a.
lisa's slumber party. who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
coming up next, an elephant who never forgets... to brush!
because i'm "jinxed" dammit! ow! what was that for?
come here, maggie.
hiya, homer.
ah, business is slow. people today are healthier and drinking less. you know, if it wasn't for the junior high school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.
increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
aye carumba!
they say everyone can float in the dead sea, but selma sank right to the bottom.
whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. what do you call it?
okay, why don't you make us up a couple of "flaming homers"?
hey, hey, this drink is delicious! and my phlegm feels looser. what do you call it?
i'll be back.
pardon me, are you the genius behind the "flaming moe"?
honey, what's wrong?
can i help you sir?
your name's not on the list.
okay, what's your name?
not on the list.
hiya, scrumptious. do you want to ignite my drink?
single parent, are we?
well, let's pretend you are.
oh, hiya, homer. how 'bout a beer?
homer, i'm sorry you're mad at me, but this isn't personal. this is business.
what? i'm sorry. homer, i couldn't hear you.
what?
homer, you're gonna have to speak up!
homer, i'll talk to you tomorrow.
yeah, what do you want?!
okay, then.
well homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
of course. all work and moe play makes moe a moe moe.
what the...
homer, no!
ah, she left to pursue a movie career. frankly i think she was better off here.
compliments of the house. one "flaming homer".
i'll get that whale song cassette that you like, sir.
i know how you feel, simpson. i've never seen mr. burns so depressed.
people think that because he's rich and powerful and cruel, he doesn't have feelings like other men. but he does. and you know what? i bet he wouldn't sell the plant for a hundred million dollars.
homer, it's your stockbroker. your stock in the power plant just went up for the first time in ten years.
yes, all the employees got some in exchange for waiving certain constitutional rights.
wait a minute. let's not do that yet. the book says we have to make a little small talk before you get down to business. everybody alive?
like any sports?
we should get together sometime.
there. now we trust each other.
near death. i'm renewing my notary license on a weekly basis.
let me punch that up on the computer. twenty five cents a share.
hey, homer. wanna duff?
yeah, but thank you anyway.
we are interested in buying the power plant. do you think the owner would ever sell it?
we'll have a savings account. we've never had one. kids, i think everything is going to be okay from now on.
we heard! isn't it wonderful? we have some great plans for that money.
what do you mean?
you spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
hey, homer.
well, they can't fire me. i'm the only one certified to run the gaseous contaminant particularfier.
why?
what is the best way to an efficient plant? happy workers who feel secure at their jobs. so let's get to know each other better. do we have any alcoholics among us? you'll be given a six-week treatment at our drying out facility in hawaii, after which you'll return at full pay.
also, we cannot uber-emphasize the importance of employee safety. we plan to have some frank discussions with your safety inspector.
homie, come to bed.
don't worry. whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow.
well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?
yo, homer. you gotta get ready for work.
i must have phrased that badly. my english is, how you say... inelegant. i meant to say, may we have a brief, friendly chat?
once again, i have failed. we request the pleasure of your company for a free exchange of ideas.
you've been safety inspector for two years. what initiatives have you spearheaded in that time?
i see. then you must have some good ideas for the future as well.
we understand homer. after all, we are from the land of chocolate.
mr. simpson...
mr. simpson...
that was ten minutes ago!
ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. hold your nose, smithers, we're going in! watch me blend in. barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my "buddy" here.
homer simpson, sir. sector sieben-gruben -- i mean, sector 7g. recently terminated.
yes.
why, no.
that was no accident. let's get out of here.
"barnacle bill's home pregnancy test"? homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?
okay, let's see... "ahoy maties! if the water turns blue, a baby for you. if purple ye see, no baby thar be".
"if ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail". well, i guess i'd better go see dr. hibbert.
is anything wrong?
is mom gonna have another baby, dad?
ohhh, cool, we can race them.
doesn't mom do that stuff?
homer, you're turning the blades too fast. the golfers are complaining. slow down! that's better. ah, beautiful. keep this up and someday you'll be the guy who hands out the putters.
it's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, dad. we watch an appalling amount of tv.
homer, do you ever think about the future?
no, i mean how you plan to earn a living. i can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating.
you light up my days / and fill my nights / with song.... it can't be wrong / when it feels so goo/right / cause you -- you our song.
actually, she was singing about god.
you don't have to do that.
homer, maybe it's the champale talking, but i think you're pretty sexy.
i need you to drive me to the doctor, homer.
well, that unforgettable night we... joined the castle club...
son, you gotta marry that girl!
well, i haven't said no to you lately, have i?
is this it?
"marge, from the first moment i saw you i never wanted to be with anyone else. i don't have much to offer you... except all my love. will you marry me?"
oh, homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!
yes.
homer, i've been thinking. if the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name larry?
well, how about louie?
bob?
luke?
what about bart?
yes sir, and how will you be paying for it?
basic ceremony's twenty bucks. here's your license. be sure to get this punched every time. the tenth wedding is on the house.
there certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of god and this casino to join...
homer, same question, names reversed.
what a perfect day.
homer, i don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary.
okay, that'll do.
that's enough! next: there's a problem with the reactor, what do you do?
did you get the job?
oh, homie. hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking.
oh, hello, young man.
hey, who wants to get rich today?
"fourth notice"... "90 days overdue"... "we break thumbs"... homer, what are we going to do?
repossessing stuff is the hardest part of my job.
that is so sad.
hey homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?
that's right. all the colors of the rainbow.
my husband by my side.
homer!
homer... come home with me.
any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
aww... would you mind if i took it off now? the oil is burning my finger.
that's it. that's it. come closer... ironic, isn't it. the hunter has become the hunted. oh god, smithers, i feel so alive.
i don't care. i haven't been this impressed since i first laid eyes on a young boot-lick named waylon smithers.
welcome aboard, son.
you're a little late. she's gone to the hospital.
right where you left it.
hey, listen fatboy --
homer, does this mean --
good god.
uh, why don't you let me handle it, homer?
homie, isn't he beautiful?
homer, i'm not pregnant.
dad, can i have some money to buy bart a birthday present?
we're gonna roll this truckin' convoy / cross the u.s.a. / con-voy...
hey good lookin', we'll be back to pick you up later.
you're fired!
but order now, supply is limited.
fine.
here you go. enjoy.
quit it, dad!
i'll get some at the store tomorrow, homer.
uh-huh.
bart! what's wrong with you?
how do you mean, dad?
how does that make him a hero?
ow! knock it off you bald boob!
like to see you fit.
so it seems we've all been the victims of a cruel hoax, perpetrated by a ten-year-old-hooligan. the time has come for finger-pointing. and most of them are squarely aimed at the boy's parents.
homer!
you know, i've done a lot of bad stuff through the years. i guess now i'm paying the price. but there's so many things i'll never get a chance to do. smoke a cigarette, use a fake i.d., shave a swear word in my hair...
actually, i don't know if i've ever heard bart play one of your albums--
man, i was so scared.
now stay tuned for six hours of exciting football action.
but if you're one of those compulsive types who just has to bet -- well, i don't know... uh... denver.
moe's tavern. where the peanut bowl is freshened hourly.
oh, sure thing, moe. i was just using it as a coaster.
pleasure doing business with you, h. s.
ho, look at that score. moxy!
wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
well folks, when you're right fifty-two percent of the time, you're wrong forty-eight percent of the time.
i certainly do, brett. i hereby declare miami to be smooth jimmy's "lock of the week."
you want some of this don't ya?
well you need to know the winners. and i know the winners. so call me now! whoa! five dollars for the first minute. two dollars for each additional minute. you have reached the coach's hot...
line.
in the game of mi-a-mi...
cin-
nat-
ti...
we must consider many things. the wind...
at five
knots...
touchdown dolphins!
all right, dolphins!
fifty big ones?
you mean you made a bet?
what could be more exciting than the savage ballet that is pro football?
see how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
and the final from riverfront stadium, miami 24 -- cincinnati 10.
boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars.
really, where?
did you two have fun?
can i watch football with you again next sunday?
this team is fired up! we came here to play!
he'll lose.
look at the fear in his eyes. listen to the quiver in his voice. he's a little boy, lost in a game of men.
dad, i hate to break the mood, but i'm getting nauseous.
oh doctor, what a finish! the final score -- atlanta seventeen -- houston thirteen. and the lowly falcons are flyin' high. who would have thunk it?
yeah, me!
c'mon, dad. it doesn't take a genius to realize that houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game.
okay, ya lucky moron. here you go, homer. a hundred and thirty-five dollars.
look at these prices. we could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
hello, i'm marco. i'll be your waiter.
charming lad.
well, maybe the paint has shut off his pores and he's slowly suffocating. still, that is a real fan.
dad, i'm making the chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. and with your blessing, i'd like to tie it to the cowboys plus five at chicago.
hey homer, you wanna go bowling next sunday?
oh dad, you must've bought me every malibu stacey accessory there is.
homer, those are very thoughtful presents. but you have to tell me where you got the money from.
i promise i will get mad, because i always do when you make me promise i won't.
homer! i did not! i promised i would get mad! she's an eight-year-old girl.
but gambling is illegal.
you know, dad, we've been watching a lot of tv lately. maybe, the sunday after the super bowl, we could hike up to the top of mount springfield. the fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets.
what about daddy-daughter day?
so you've come to buy my forgiveness. sorry, homer.
yeah, i did.
put me down. look dad, i'll tell you who's gonna win the super bowl if you want me to. but it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me.
i think dallas is a mortal lock.
however...
however, i may be so clouded with rage that subconsciously i want you to lose. in which case, i'd bet the farm on buffalo.
wow!
dallas kicks -- oh, it's a bad kick, way too short. buffalo's going to start with excellent field position.
whatcha got riding on this game?
hey homer, didn't you say if duff dry wins, your daughter loves you?
touchdown cowboys!
so, with three ticks left on the clock, it all comes down to this one play. if dallas scores here, happy fans'll be looting and turning over cars in the lone star state tonight. here's the handoff.
what are you so happy about homer? you didn't win any money.
come on, dad!
extra mustard for bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... light mayo for lisa, cut off the crust... double bologna for homer....
videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, homer's dry-cleaning -- i think that's everything.
homer, i'm running late as it is. can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?
where's my lucky red cap?
homer? is that you?
how about, "yes, it's me".
tell her you love her.
why don't you just wrap it up?
i need a vacation.
i need to unwind.
no. i mean a vacation by myself.
no homie, no. i still love you. a lot of couples take separate vacations.
wish i'd thought of that.
uh-huh. he'll probably trade her for a beer and a nudie magazine.
goodbye, homie.
check the dryer!
then just push nine on your phone. then the pound sign. then four-eight-three. we'll do the rest.
no problem. well, well, if it isn't little bart. remember your uncle barney? hey homer, let me hold him.
oh man, you want a bad night, try sleeping on one of these.
don't worry, don't worry. you know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna make you an omlette.
hey, homer. i think i've got her. come on!
what do you want?
wait here. and don't steal any light bulbs.
dad!
homer, that's awful!
you the man who reported the lost baby?
can you describe her?
bingo!
hi, did you miss me?
and from now on i hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
maybe we should let the dog in?
i think he needs a dog house.
i am not!
oh, i don't know...
you've got a date with a xerox machine.
of course i saved them. although actually there's only one. and it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited.
homer?
i'm afraid i have a bone to pick with you.
no, i-i came to talk to you about your potty-mouth.
look homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. so, i don't want to be hard on you... but i just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys.
what?
okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. i'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?
well, you know, maybe he's right.
actually, homer, you brought up ned flanders. i never said a word --
yes, homer.
no, homer.
yes, homer.
i can't help but feel partly responsible. homer, that was a twenty.
how's the dog supposed to get in?
dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse.
there was more than enough in the swear jar. and if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise.
no, behind her.
homer! bart, you did a very cruel thing.
no, homer. the truth would humiliate her.
maybe we should write her another letter. one that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
that's disgusting. and besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face.
oh, that's very good, lisa.
how shall we end it?
ohhh, homer, you old honey dripper.
hey homer, slow down. you're gonna choke or somethin'.
homer, last year we were two and twenty-eight.
actually, it was.
what's that? a home-made bat?
homie, come to bed. homer, go back to the garage.
okay, homer, bases loaded and you're up. where's that secret weapon?
and i got an enchanted jock strap.
no, i want to get him a beer.
one more outburst like that and i'll send you back to the big leagues!
yes.
so?
you hit so many home runs this year. what makes you think this darryl strawberry character is better than you?
you make me sick homer. you're the one who told me i could do anything if i just put my mind to it.
yes!
wait a minute, are you ken griffey jr.?
you heard me, hippie.
aw, nuts!
like snuggling...
to the game.
all right, tie game. bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, strawberry coming up...
you should be very proud of yourself. sit down! simpson! you're batting for strawberry.
...it means the signal is a fake.
however, i can take that off by dusting my hands thusly.
if i want you to bunt, i will touch my belt buckle not once, not twice, but thrice... got that simpson?
now batting for darryl strawberry, homer simpson.
lisa, it's not that bad.
that's nice, bart. you know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. but they said he was too heavy.
honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help.
you're wrong, you're wrong! you don't need long fingers to play the blues. the blues come from in here! my god, they are stubby.
bart's grades are up a little this term. but lisa's are way down.
we have three kids, homer.
no, maggie!
you know, i heard the jackpot's up to one hundred and thirty million dollars.
but we never ever...
i buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. we each play our birthday. and that's enough excitement for me.
homer, we're on a tight budget here. promise me you won't get carried away.
you can still win some money if you have five out of six.
give it to the poor.
what are you gonna do, homer?
hey homer, what'd you do? get a haircut or something?
oh i know what it is. you're the biggest man in the world now. and you're covered in gold.
yeah, i knew we wouldn't win.
grampa, he's not dead!
this is the part of the job i hate.
this is never an easy decision. it's an awful lot of money.
is there a doggie hell?
who's in there?
checkers.
we are not going to let our dog die! and that's it! lousy dog-killing sonsa...
oh, please, continue...
no.
you are not going to perform that operation yourself.
i've found a way we can pay for the operation.
we all have to make sacrifices, dear. maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer...
you wouldn't want what he's eating. it's mostly just snouts and entrails.
yes, i'm back. kent brockman is not the kind of a man who would leave a $500,000 a year job just because he won a lottery. hey, i'm a journalist.
what's that?
before his dog got sick, that "old rummy" used to be my best customer.
go get it, pal.
homie, did you close the gate?
the dog will get out!
i'm looking for something in an attack dog. one who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh. why here's the fellow! wiry... fast... firm proud buttocks. reminds me of me.
poor santa's little helper. i'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
homer get a-hold of yourself. even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. remember doggie heaven.
i'm not giving up. i don't care if i have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. i'm gonna find my dog.
you can pet the cat.
oh, there's a spot, dear.
that spot says "compact only".
uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad.
well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and i will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. hmm?
maybe we could see something a little more adult.
ooh! the paper called it a "taut political thriller".
get me jed kolick!
homie, aren't you coming inside?
them's fightin' words!
we don't sell duff. we sell fudd.
our next act is our very own singin' waitress, lurleen! ... so, i'm afraid drink service will stop for just a few moments while she -- they're all yours.
then you go home to your castle/ but your queen won't cut you slack/
that's why you're losin' all your hair/... that's why you're overweight/...
that's why you flipped your pick-up truck right off the interstate/...
there's a lot of bull they hand you/ there's nothin' you can do/ your wife don't understand you/ but i do/ no, your wife don't understand you/ but i do/ i said no one understands you/ but i do/
so what's your name, stranger?
my name's lurleen lumpkin.
oh, you think so?
where were you all night?
fudd? i thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
well, if it isn't homer j. simpson.
oh, aren't you sweet.
sorry, darlin', all my songs are up here. "i'm bastin' a turkey with my tears", "don't look up my dress unless you mean it", "i'm sick of your lyin' lips and false teeth"...
homer, it's your quarter, what do you say?
country music sucks. all it does is take precious air space away from shock dj's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
well, it's nice. but who is this woman?
i don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
oh homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin' somethin' in return.
homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.
uh-huh. now, homer, i want you to be my manager.
that's okay.
i didn't even go.
i don't want to. i'm mad at you. i'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing.
homer! where did you get that suit?
was it lurleen?
have you kissed her?
has she kissed you?
i want you to stop seeing her.
her manager? that's ridiculous. i won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
this studio has a lot of history. buddy holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, "there is no way in hell that i'm gonna record in this dump".
homer, how much did you just give that man?
hmmm. i thought you said she was overweight!
hey dad, can i do a ham-bone solo?
oh homer! you're as smart as you are handsome.
well, i have been working on something that could really heat things up.
in this trailer, i get so cold and lonely/ lyin' there awake at night/ muttering if only you weren't married/ so i might ask you to bunk with me tonight/ bunk with me tonight/ oh bunk with me tonight/ i'm askin' will you bunk with me tonight?
uh, homer, there's a hidden message to this song that you may have missed. really listen. bunk with me tonight...
that's right homer j.
i gotta go. homer...
just so you know, while you and lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, maggie cut her first tooth.
you're not even listening to me!
excuse me, are you colonel homer simpson?
i'm from rebel yell records, a division of togasaki corp. i'm interested in buying lurleen's contract.
well thank you -- i'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
well... you could make my evening complete. what's wrong?
i'll love you for the rest of my life.
uh-huh.
i'll give you fifty bucks.
homer?
now kids, i know you're all excited about meeting aunt selma's new boyfriend tonight.
ewww.
that's right, aunt selma. your new boyfriend here framed krusty the clown for armed robbery.
ahh, mr. simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the buddha.
now, about your wedding dress. i'm not sure how to put this... white. and what would you like for appetizers?
well homer, you seem to be a trencherman. what should we serve?
very well. i... i... i can't do it! even that car chase seemed tacked on.
aunt selma has one hour to live!
after trying four times to explain it to homer, i explained it to mom and we were on our way.
hey homer, let's book! i want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act.
my little guy's first rock concert. i hope the spinal taps don't play too loud.
hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything.
we'll discuss it later. is milhouse okay?
homer, i've been thinking about what bart said. if he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should buy him a guitar.
i meant a real guitar.
and it came with a free instruction book.
mom, can otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? he sure can!
that's not my voice!
the admiral and i don't get along. please let me stay here. i've got nowhere else to go.
i know we didn't ask for this, homer, but doesn't the bible say, "whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"
what's on?
because... i was that maniac! hey, hey, i was just kidding.
but homer, we're the only family he's got...
heyyy, mr. s...
add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
dad, what if i told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?
according to eternity magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. that's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
they'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. as you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less.
homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?
i don't know if that tape is working. you ate three desserts tonight.
there's another thing i've been wanting to talk to you about...
dad! dad! do you know what today is?
you mean a spoon?
this can't be right. this man has 104% body fat! hey, no eating in the tank!
how was your day at work, dear?
homer!
there, there. you're safe now, little sister.
"well, i never thought i'd see it. they're dancing on the berlin wall. these lithe and lively lovers of liberation..."
pyle!
yeah, you gonna to be okay?
all you have to do is sign this form.
all right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... montgomery burns... uh... award for... a-a-a outstanding achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, excellence!
webster's dictionary defines excellence as "the quality or condition of being excellent". and now, the winner of the first annual montgomery burns award for outstanding achievement in the field of excellence.
dad, you know you won.
you cleaned me out smokin' joe. what's the matter homer? cummerbund too tight?
i know how you feel. you lost a couch. i lost a heavyweight championship.
let's do it.
but sir...
this chair is $2,000. we could buy a whole living room set for that.
this money was a blessing. we can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
bart... lisa. i'm so glad to see you.
i'm sorry, homer. but i'm still mad at you. every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face.
homer, he knows how to work a light switch.
i got the recipe from the utility grade beef counsel.
that's all i got.
well, i think we should invest in a set of the great books of western civilization. look at this ad from "new republic for kids." each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: "paradise regained," "martin chuzzlewit," or herman melville's twin classics "omoo" and "typee".
up-up-up-up. not here. come into the dining room. i want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
okay. now, before i tell you about my idea, i'd like to show you this.
take it easy, homer. now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed...
no, homer. that invention is out already. i'm just using it as an example.
nope.
what do you think, homer?
homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!
well, homer, now what do you think?
don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. he is your brother.
homer, walk me to my car.
this is what you get, homer. i forgive you. you can call me brother and i can do the same.
that's it.
oh, i dreamt it was the last day of school.
homie, you do remember your promise to the children?
yeah. well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. it now goes: d,b,a,c.
but dad...
well, here goes nothin'.
well, dad, here's my report card. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
no, sir.
so i won't get to go to camp?
oh, dad. you're the best father a boy could ever have!
ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the bart philosophy, but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty.
hey, hands off my pickle.
no, but...
you can have the shower to yourself, homie. i'm finished.
ohhh...
oh, that's wonderful.
dear kids, i hope this letter finds you well. we are doing great. your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever.
i haven't been in a play since high school, and i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.
you know, i spend all day alone with maggie... and sometimes it's like i don't even exist.
it's time to name our five finalists, starting with... miss montana!
miss south carolina!
la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
tonight, my reign as miss american girl comes to an end. and i'd like to apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the united nations.
i'm auditioning for a play.
i told you several times. it's a musical version of "a streetcar named..."
sorry.
i'm sorry, honey.
i don't think so.
homer, can you run some lines with me?
i'm sorry, llewellyn. i just... i just don't see why blanche should shove a broken bottle in stanley's face. couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?
marge! marge! i'm asking for white hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit!
oh here!
stanley is thoughtless, violent and loud. marge, every second you spend with this man, he is crushing your fragile spirit. you can't let that happen.
heah you ah, homah.
can i slog off school tomorrow? got a pain in me gulliver.
see you later, kids. ah've got to go rehearse with ned.
for god's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!
i'm sure you won't enjoy it. there's nothing about bowling in the play... oh wait, there is.
why can't you be a little more supportive?
what kooky projects?
why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
it's mom!
almost everybody.
lookin' for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guv'nor?
oh, come on, homer. by the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up.
really?
get up, homer. it's time for church.
it's church. you have to go.
i'm tired of having this argument every sunday. get dressed.
it's eleven kbbl degrees below zero. i hope you're someplace warm.
who wears short shorts?
of course, johnny's next record was a spoken-word album of his right-wing political views, that kinda killed his career. if you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line - now!
homer, can you name that title?
you heard the lady - grab her spine and get cracking.
let's define our terms, gentleman. are we talking about redistricting, or are we talking about reapportionment? because the two are by no means the same.
we interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.
oh, doctor. a 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! we have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today. three visits from morganna the kissing bandit... and the astonishing return of jim brown...
that's a terrible thing to say. kids, your father doesn't really mean that.
homer! are you actually giving up your faith?
i can't believe you're giving up church, homer.
amen, brother.
lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. please show him the error of his ways.
no, homer. he doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, lord. he just likes to sleep in on sundays...
thou hast forsaken my church!
but what?
oh yeah.
i couldn't agree more. that reverend lovejoy really displeases me. i think i'll give him a canker sore.
i will.
dad, can i ask you a question?
no, it's nothing bad. i'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately.
oh, really?
so, homer, you saw the big cheese? what'd he look like?
homer, i'd like you to remember matthew 7:26 -- "the foolish man, who built his house on sand." "and he left them, and went out of the city into bethany, and he lodged there"?
neighbor, i heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock.
get those animals out on the arky, arky -
i see him, son.
i have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, i'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked.
coming up next, "make your own ladder."
hello. i'm collecting for the brotherhood of jewish clowns. last year, tornadoes claimed the lives of seventy-five jewish clowns. the worst incident was during our convention in lubbock, texas. there were floppy shoes and rainbow wigs everywhere... it was terrible...
a religious clown thing, yes.
oh, but i am. i have a shrine to ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.
homer! homer! nooo! dear lord, may your loving hand guide homer to the mattress square and true. o-kay.
heck, you'd have done the same for me. help! help!
oh, homey! are you all right?
truly this was an act of god.
sorry, this policy only covers actual losses, not made-up stuff.
coming up next... which works better - springy clothes pins, or the other kind?
yes, the lesson is...
ah, that's super.
that's game, hendrix!
homer, i can't tell you that.
you'll find out when you die.
you can't wait six months?
now in a moment, we'll be raffling off our grand prize... a ride on the famous duff beer blimp!
you see the circular pattern on those fields? that's from central-pivot irrigation.
oops! sorry.
we have one at home. you never use it.
dad, do you think i'm ugly?
i'm an ugmo.
fathers have to say that stuff.
no! you're homely as a mule's butt!
not for a second .
what a feeling! i'm as happy as a smoker taking that first puff in the morning.
sure!
no! no! i meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.
what are you talking about?
homer, lisa's already sensitive about her looks. this is the last thing she needs.
dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? hubba, hubba.
you're looking at her through a father's eyes.
like what?
i know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
whooo! whooo! dad, do you know anything else about women?
my name is lisa simpson, and i want to be little miss springfield so i can make our town a better place!
thanks, dad.
but you're a role model to young people. and we're thinking of retiring "menthol moose".
homer, those are ice cream men.
dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?
uh-huh.
hey homer - where's your present?
hey!
we sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. we also sell frozen yogurt... which i call frogurt!
but it comes with a free frogurt.
the frogurt is also cursed.
but you get your choice of topping.
the toppings contain potassium benzoate. that's bad.
i'm krusty the clown and i'm going to kill you!
homer, what's wrong?
i'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to dad, but what pressure?
guess who, fat boy?
i love you, homer.
here ya' go buddy.
yeah, he buried me a couple a times.
so?
and?
smithers, this is a golden opportunity. if we get him alive we can put him on broadway. dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the army!
dad, we did something very bad.
no.
uh huh.
homer, did you barricade the door?
it's our only hope.
dad, you killed the zombie flanders!
i'm not a zombie. but hey, when in rome... wow, george washington.
shh! tv!
what are we going to have?
poison pizza.
is it 37?
homer!
oh, all right.
ach.
uh... we'd like the desk back mr. simpson.
just do it.
homer, we have a problem here.
we're talking about bart.
you already put me in a home.
i'll be good. look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!
now this is exactly what bart's teacher was talking about. our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
please, homer. why do i always have to be the bad guy?
i promise.
wow.
indeed i did.
ayy, el estomago!
i'unno.
well, you could punish me, but...
uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
why are you letting him do this?
how could you let this happen?
i wasn't here!
homer, do you want your son to become chief justice of the supreme court or a sleazy male stripper?
earl warren wasn't a stripper.
during the war itchy & scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe. we'll be back with a real life itchy & scratchy. a rabid mouse in boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
come on, homer. this isn't funny.
dad, you gotta let me see that movie. can't you just give me a spanking? come on, go nuts.
dad, i agree that bart should be punished, but the itchy and scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. how would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?
i regret nothing!
not bloody likely.
dad, what's the point of this story?
look, can i please go to the movie?
homer, we'd like to talk to you.
dad, you've got to let bart see that movie. i've never seen him like this. he has the demented melancholia of a tennessee williams heroine.
well, it's been two months. you laid down the law and i'm proud of you. but i think we've gotten through to him.
well, dad, i guess you won.
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court.
one soylent green. hold the butter.
itchy.
resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of "lemon time"...
oooh! they're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
howdy-do, neighbor! good pipe weather. thought i'd fire up the briar.
did you notice how slanted he looked?
haw haw!
first, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel...
now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation?
good. assemble the aluminum j-channel using self-furring screws. install.
after applying brushable coating to the panels...
if you can't find metal stucco lath....
now, parge the lath...
i'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking. i figure it's gonna cost you... oh, eighty-five hundred.
behold the horrors of the slanty shanty. see the twisted creatures that dwell within. meet "cue ball," the man with no hair!
i could get a job.
tonight, we've all come to honor a close friend of ours...
a man who provided the burns corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, mr. jack marley.
maybe i should apply for that job.
chauffeur... seamstress... curator of large mammals?
we need the money, and my life is pretty boring. last week some jehovah's witnesses came to the door and i wouldn't let them leave. they snuck away when i went in the kitchen to get more lemonade.
i think it's wonderful. mom and dad side by side at the power plant. you'll be just like marie and pierre curie.
i'll just be a minute. i have to finish this paperwork.
it's working! it's working! and the healthy snacks are on their way.
springtime fresh, winter white... what could be better?
homie, what's wrong?
well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder.
you know the problem here was water leakage. if you just buy a fifty cent washer --
well, i guess that's it. people like us can't afford justice. come on homie, let's go before he fires you too.
you love her, too.
homer, i want you to show this woman the time of her life.
mr. simpson, my husband and i have decided to move...
yes, well, there's a few things you could do to help us sell our home. first, whenever you walk in front of your window could you please wear pants?
second, could you please take in your jack-o-lanterns from past halloweens.
and please cover your garbage. it's attracting wildlife.
set sail for "the fryin' dutchman."
but i think i'm allergic to seafood. the last time i ate shrimp, my throat closed up and i went into convulsions.
i guess i should explain. laura's father and i divorced two years ago. oh, they're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career, career, career.
daad!
my divorce.
well i know what you're thinking and the answer is yes, i want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. after all, homer, i do have the normal appetites.
i'm not.
right.
'tis no man. 'tis a remorseless eating machine. arrrr... six bells, time for closin'.
fairly warned be thee, says i.
oh, please don't. for me?
don quixote?
i really think that was the character's name... don quixote!
well, who was it?
it's not working!
mr. simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film "the neverending story."
dad, i have some questions about women.
homer, bart's at a very curious age. as his father, i think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know.
are you sure...?
dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?
it was a moonless night, dark as pitch, when out of the mist came a beast more stomach than man.
uh, there's a pizza here for...
hi, homie. it's really starting to snow. i think you should come home.
you're dead weight, marty.
she'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene.
oh. i guess you're only familiar with the new "batman" movies. michelle pfeiffer... ha! the only true "catwoman" is julie newmar, lee merriwether or eartha kitt. and i didn't need molded plastic to improve my physique. pure west. and how come batman doesn't dance anymore? remember the batusi?
homer, i've got to sneak these viable artworks out of the white house. but i can't get out of my driveway because of those protesters.
pally, this doesn't cost money, it makes money! you make the payments by plowing driveways on the side.
i can't believe you bought that plow. we can't afford it.
good.
oh, homie, didn't that hurt?
and now, to read from the epistles of st. paul, homer simpson.
arr! ninety sea chanteys on three compact discs. blow the man down maties / blow the man down... row, row, row your boat / in the navy come on and join your fellow man... act now and get a bonus cd: "hornpipe fever." arrgh.
dad, who's watching tv at 3:17 a.m.?
look! there we are!
that's right! i fill your driveways with ice and snow! what are you gonna do about it? nuthin', that's what.
all right... i'm goin'... my head hurts. i have to lie down for a while.
uh-huh.
but i'm a real tightwad. can i afford this remarkable system?
you are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you mr. plow?
here i come world!
i was wrong about you buying that truck. i'm very proud of you, mr. plow. . this might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind...
no. no. could you wear the mr. plow jacket. just uh... for fun.
hi ya, homer! say hello to the plow king!
thank you, plow king-a-lee-ding.
ah, homer, why don't you plow it again?
hello, i'm calling from delinquent accounts at kumatsu motors --
i think you should do a new ad. one that's fresh and original.
dad, was that your commercial?
the torch has been passed to a new generation of, uh, snow plow people... come on, give me the key. these look like teeth marks.
that's great arnie.
i don't know. i'd be up there all day... i wouldn't be able to plow any other driveways...
well, i guess you can plow my driveway. but i wonder what happened to the plow king.
oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt?
homie, please don't go.
ah, dying's not so bad. i'll be reunited with my loved ones. my dad... and that plant i never watered.
hello, this is the repo depot. i'm just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow.
ohh, now homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something.
he does not.
well, don't push her. remember, "tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."
i miss-a da klinger already.
homer!
homer.
homer.
domer.
hi yo!
got your wallet.
guess what, homie... there's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now.
we're going to have another baby.
i'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
won't that warp him?
you don't have a cousin frank.
we were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect... just imagine what we can do with this place.
well, here's what they're asking.
why'd you come to me. i don't know nothing. i used to get by on my looks. now they're gone -- withered away like an old piece of fruit.
no, not yet. i was voted the handsomest boy in albany, new york.
i ratted on everybody and got off scot free! all right, son. i'll sell this dump and write you a check.
so, how long before you shipped grampa off to the old folks home?
mommy.
when are we going to get to my first word?
daaad!
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole.
hey, homer. this house sucks.
you'll be history! buenos dias, neighboritos. the handle's flanders, but my friends call me ned.
well, gee, i...
i just this minute bought it at the hardware st...
sure, you can borrow it for a little while.
bart, get out!
crib! crib! i'm a baby!
oh, doctor! we are seconds away from the 100-meter butterfly, and with the east german "women" shaving their backs 9,000 miles away. ... the americans are heavy favorites.
homie... i think the baby's coming.
coming up next, an hour-long episode of mama's family.
according to this magazine, bart might be jealous of her.
where's the beef? what the hell's that supposed to mean?
you people are pigs! i personally am gonna spit in every 50th burger.
ouch! but first, let's go to the boxing venue.
i'm sorry, bart, you're too little.
homer!
heidy-ho, simpson. your son shoved this through our doggie door. and since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my tv tr...
wow! lisa, can you say "mommy"?
honey, you really shouldn't eat so much in bed. it's not good for your heart.
homie, what is it?
daaad!
homer, i prepared a special surprise just for you.
nice healthy oatmeal.
no there isn't.
dad, there's a bug on that.
it's your heart. and i think it's on its last thump.
clear!
oh, homie, i was so frightened.
what a voice. young homer is going to make me a millionaire.
mr. simpson, i'm afraid you've just had a mild heart attack.
coochy coochy coo!
oh, you swing like a girl. come on, now.
got your nose.
how 'bout this little bee?
good lord.
now homer, this is a new body fat analysis test. i start you jiggling, and measure how long it takes to stop.
homer, i'm afraid you'll have to undergo a coronary by-pass operation.
you're going to need open heart surgery!
seventy dollars.
no. don't you have health insurance at work?
now before we give you health insurance, i have to ask you a few questions.
oh good. now, under "heart attacks" you crossed out "3" and wrote "0".
all right. here's your policy.
oh, hold on there, you still have to sign it.
sir, i'm sorry, we can't insure you.
no, that doesn't count.
mr. simpson, you must get that operation as soon as possible.
honey, did you have any luck?
what is it, dad?
hi everybody. are you looking for a way to slash the cost of your medical expenses?
how?
operation? what are you talking about?
we feel neither highs nor lows.
eh.
oh, no. what if they botch it? i won't have a dad... for a while.
what about abraham lincoln?
homer!
homer simpson! well, if that don't put the "dink" in co-inky-dink.
first come, first served! what are you in for?
if i could give you my heart, homer, i would.
ah, you know, homer, that beer ain't free.
shhh.
hey hey! hey, what's the matter? oh, that's right. my grotesque appearance.
oh, it's part of my public service for my glug, glug, vroom, vroom, thump thump.
well, there's nothing funny about what you're about to go through. i know, i'm in the zipper club myself.
we passed this card around at work.
uh, homer, i snuck you in a beer for old time's sake.
oh homie, i could never remarry...
ohhh... kids, you can come in now.
thanks dad.
ordah! please rise for the a pledge of allegiance.
excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town.
well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition main street is in. many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
you know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. no one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!
i still think we should have spent the money to fix main street.
are you stuck in a dead-end job?
are you squandering the precious gift of life in front of the idiot box?
are you on your third beer of the evening?
homer, no...
your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?
true or false: you can get mono from riding the monorail?
no, you were right, it's "false." wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!
but now, i want to follow in your footsteps.
according to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. what if something goes wrong?
it frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
no.
oh, right, that. well, i've been monitoring your progress closely... but this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.
yeah, sure.
homer, there's a family of opossums in here!
is there a chance the track could bend?
can't you stop it, dad?
does anyone wanna switch seats?
homer? homer?
homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you.
dad, you're a hero!
and "the washing machine"!
see the happiest fish in the world at our fabulous beerquarium!
yayyy!
no use complaining about something you can't change.
oh homer, quit pouting.
if you don't mind! we're on our way to a funeral.
which old witch?
yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!
homer, that's very rude of you.
another placemat, sir?
eh.
to marge, i leave my collection of potato chips that resemble celebrities. they're all here. otto von bismarck. maurice chevalier. right up to jay leno. these chips were my children, marjorie. take special care of them.
can we go to duff gardens this weekend?
aunt selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?
have you been eating that sandwich again?
you've been eating that thing for a week. i think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
homer, i found this behind the radiator. i really think you should throw it away.
are you going to eat it?
you look terrible.
goodbye dad! don't eat any solids.
yayyy!
do you feel any better?
well, to cheer you up i rented a couple of videos. "boxing's greatest weigh-ins" and "yentl".
what's going on here? oh, yentl. i might have known.
hmmm, well, you've cooled down.
you know, i rented another tape... in case you felt better.
with norman fell as zeus!
how do you do it, homer?
homer, we're going to my sisters'! remember, pick up bart!
after sixteen glorious seasons, the green bay faithful bid farewell to bryan bartlett starr.
hey homie, i can see your doodle!
no, i just think you should talk to bart about-- good lord! homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?
no, no. someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called "the corey hotline."
i did. dad, can i...
nah, his game was blackjack. he bet our life savings on a single hand.
twenty-one.
father-son picnic.
bart, i could kiss you, if the bigger brothers hadn't made me sign a form promising i wouldn't. no one needs me more than a child with your tragic upbringing. now, let's set down at that frogurt stand.
playing with milhouse.
and what are your reasons for wanting a little brother?
any of these boys would be thrilled to have a bigger brother like you.
do you have a bigger brother for me yet? okay. i'll be back in an hour.
just like oscar the grouch.
your son bart sounds very bad.
shaddap!
why does it stop there?
tell me more! i want to know all the constellations!
i love you, poppa homer.
pepi.
hey, homer, have you seen my skateboard?
who the hell is pepi?
i was faking it.
oh yeah? remember this? "higher, dad, higher!... whee, whee... push harder, dad!..."
is that true?
come on, bart. you know better than to talk to strangers.
there you go, fellas. 
uh... homer?
another beer, dad?
dad, remember when tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, "i'm a hemophiliac" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back?
yeah.
yeah.
and this is for my huggy bug in honor of this special day.
ah, thank you, dear.
hey, dad. why don't you give mom her present?
one hundred dollars.
ohh, i think you will.
la da de / la da da... la da dum da de da da dum da dum da de
oh, i'd give anything to go to that show!
hey!
ralph thinks i like him. but i only gave him a valentine 'cause i felt sorry for him.
well, honey, i--
thanks, mom.
forget it. to get those tickets our parents would have to be part of springfield's cultural elite.
oh no, it's ralph! just make some excuse.
yes, sir. i'd do anything for lisa.
dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?
well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me.
homer, that's a terrible thing to say.
yeah. you got a tail-light out.
hasta la vista, abie.
and now, our evening comes to an end...
homer, i want you to encourage lisa with her science fair project.
yes please!
i'd also like to express my fondness for that particular beer.
... and here we have duff, duff lite, and our newest flavor, duff dry. what does the future hold for duff? let's just say we've got a few ideas up our sleeve.
um, i'd rather not get into it right now.
all right, we don't have any ideas for the future. we got nothing. happy?
are you crazy? we still haven't tried raspberry duff, lady duff, tartar control duff...
i'm fine.
ow. what was that for?
look alive, boys. coupla stewed prunes headed your way.
haw haw!
what a terrible waste. hi! i'm actor, troy mcclure. you might remember me from such driver's ed films as "alice's adventures through the windshield glass" and "the decapitation of larry leadfoot." for the next 60 minutes we'll be seeing actual film of car crash victims.
my name is hans. drinking has ruined my life. i'm thirty-one years old.
homie, do you ever drink alone?
do you need a beer to fall asleep?
do you ever hide beer around the house?
homie, i'd like you to do something for me.
i want you to give up beer for a month.
please, homie, i know you can do this.
what was that noise?
cupcakes, cupcakes. yes, sweet cakes for all.
dang, i was aiming for his head.
the windup and the two two pitch... oh no! the batter is calling for time... looks like he's going and getting himself a new bat. and now there's a beachball on the field. and the ballboys are discussing which one of them is gonna go get it.
uh huh. this is the 128 ounce tub. you can fit your whole head in it. don't be scared jubjub. it's mama.
so homer, please feel free to tell us anything. there's no judgment here.
chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug.
you don't have to start drinking right away. i was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
but you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look. you've saved more than a hundred dollars. i found it in your pants.
ow.
that is one evil dude.
homer, lisa needs braces.
soon!
bullseye!
lisa needs braces.
i wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure.
congratulations, homer!
... unless you're crooked.
this is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
don homer, my son, he has trouble with the...
do you think you can get the dental plan back?
dad, i'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish.
hmm, he's a worthy foe. look at him, smithers. exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine.
honey, you look fine.
goons.
hired goons.
ah, homer! i hope crusher and low blow didn't hurt you.
ohh, shut up. and this is my basement.
yes, i really should stop ending the tour with it. now, let's get down to business. now, homer, i know what you're thinking and i want to take the pressure off. it doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon.
oh. it's the twenty-third door on the left.
find the bathroom alright?
because they love you down at the plant.
that doesn't sound like they like you at all.
nay.
yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore.
look at them all, through the darkness i'm bringing. they're not sad at all, they're actually singing! they sing without juicers! they sing without blenders! they sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! tell simpson i'm ready to deal all right! you can even have the dental plan!... on one condition. you must resign as head of the union.
smithers, i'm beginning to think that homer simpson was not the brilliant tactician i thought he was.
oh no, i can't see! i'm blind! blind!
you're goin' down, homer! i'm gonna fool you!
p.u.
like halloween and christmas, april fool's day traces its origins to pagan ritual.
the christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
dad! i was telling the story.
beer! beer is the cheese. but how to use it...
ay, no es bueno.
the following is a public service announcement. excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum.
homie!
arrrgh!
i won't jump anymore, i promise.
i love you, dad.
right, dad.
i brought you a little present.
hey, what'll i tell the boss?
you can do it, homer. stand up.
he just won't budge. i've tried everything. nothing can reach him.
please, do go on...
oh, please, continue...
hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?
why?
dad, it's all my fault! i shook up that can of beer! it was just an april fool's joke.
you lost five percent of your brain.
it's so sad that krusty is ashamed of his roots.
"third notice," "final notice," "some guys are coming."... ooh, what's this? an invitation to our high school reunion. gee, that's odd. they didn't send one to you.
well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. wait, maybe it does.
and you're a nuclear technician?
what did you way?
time to go to the reunion.
oh, it's you simpson.
i am not a crook.
hello, marge. have you heard? i'm stinking rich. jealous?
i would.
okay, very good. now, let's get on with our rilly big shew...
... first, the award for the alumnus who's gained the most weight... homer simpson!
how'd you do it, homer?
and now, the award for most improved odor... homer simpson!
it fell in the toilet.
dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect.
hello, son! i was on my way home from work and thought i'd drop by.
they pay me eight hundred dollars a week to tell a cat and a mouse what to do.
welcome to remedial science 1a. my uh wife recently passed away... i thought teaching might ease my loneliness.
now, i'm going to uh burn this donut to show you how many calories it has.
the bright blue flame indicates this was a particularly sweet donut.
all right, here are your exams. fifty questions, true or false.
look, homer, just take the test and you'll do fine.
that's wonderful, homie!
hens love roosters/ geese love ganders/ everyone else loves ned flanders
it's all so barbaric.
look, dad. i don't need school. i'll make my way as a bootblack. shine yer boots guv'nor?
you're going to get an education. i'm going to teach you myself.
whacking day is coming.
but killing snakes is evil.
dad? dad, everyone likes whacking day, but i hate it. is there something wrong with me?
then, what should i do?
yeah.
yeah.
dad please, for the last time, i beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob.
that's right. order now and you'll also get sun `n' run, the suntan lotion... that's also a laxative!
hey, dad. this came for you in the mail.
smithers, this plague doesn't scare me. i've constructed a germ-free chamber for myself. not a single microbe can get in or out. who the devil are you?
... flintstones' chewable morphine.
... flintstones' chewable morphine.
morphine
morphine
no. in fact i can recite pi to 40,000 places. the last digit is one!
i'll be fine, dear.
well... once. homer, i don't think this fish is quite dead yet.
who's gonna change maggie?
oh honey, i've missed you too. homer, is that an old halloween costume?
i'll bet you want a piece of me. well, you ain't gonna get it, see! ha, ha, ha... doggone it.
did you see that?
what's gabbo?
i can't believe it. our first glimpse of gabbo!
dad...
what?... what am i lookin' at? i don't see nothin'. i'm gonna stop looking soon... what... what, is that it?
sure, but it'll cost ya.
you've got to keep working on it.
it is, it really really is.
dad, when did you record an album?
dad, thanks to television, i can't remember what happened eight minutes ago. no, really, i can't. it's a serious problem. what are we all laughing about?
hello, ma baby / hello, ma honey / hello, ma ragtime, ragtime gal / send me a kiss by wire... etc.
barbershop! that ain't been popular since aught six, dagnabit!
goodbye...
homer, i'm a theatrical agent, and i want to represent your group.
where are we going? where are we going?
old mcdonald had a farm / ee-i-ee-i-o / and on this farm he had a chick / swingingest chick i know / with a wiggle wiggle here and a wiggle wiggle there...
just a little irish ditty...
perfect.
no one bought a wishbone necklace.
look what i got. now people will stop intentionally ramming our car.
gentlemen, you've just recorded your first number one.
oh yes, bouffant betty. well i would prefer we kept your marriage a secret. you see, a lot of women are going to want to have sex with you, and we want them to think they can.
have you seen bart?
damned ceremonies. this is time i could be working, mommy.
this enormous woman will devour us all!
hello, homer. i'm george harrison.
you beat dexy's midnight runners!
miss you, daddy.
here's the champagne you ordered, mr. simpson.
wow, look at all this be sharps merchandise! lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam...
so has sinatra.
ditto tom jones.
with your father on the road all the time i tried to compensate for his absence...
for all the latest medical poop / call surgeon general, c. everett koop / koop koop adoop this is worse than your song about mr. t.
we are not.
ah that's great. your replacement was getting tired. hey, queenie, you can go now.
since when could you write a song?
... it's a trip to paradise / with my ba-by... on board!
hmm. this one's done in different handwriting.
but who'd want to hurt me? i'm this century's "dennis the menace."
that man is so rude.
oh i'll stay away from your son, all right. stay away, forever.
hiedilly-hey!
... homer simpson, marge simpson, lisa simpson, that little baby simpson. that is all.
don't worry, mrs. simpson, we've helped hundreds of people in danger. we'll give you a new name, a new job, new identities.
elway takes the snap and runs it in for a touchdown! thanks to elway's patented last-second magic, the final score of super bowl 30: denver - 7; san francisco - 56!
i'll be gus, the lovable chimney sweep. clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all westminster. yeah!
we have places your family can hide in peace and security: cape fear, terror lake, new horrorfield, screamville...
tell you what sir, from now on you'll be homer thompson at terror lake. let's just practice a bit. when i say "hello, mr. thompson," you'll say, "hi."
hello, mr. thompson. remember now, your name is homer thompson.
hello, mr. thompson.
hey look! "the fbi light opera society sings the complete gilbert and sullivan." three little maids from school are we / pert as a schoolgirl well can be / filled to the brim with girlish glee / three little maids from school...
homer, where's the dog?
we've left it all behind. how can you make a clean break with your life?
homer, this is serious.
dad, i'm kinda edgy right now. i'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife.
i knew i had to buy some time. so, i asked him to sing the score from "the hms pinafore."
duh, homer, why are we down here?
yes, he's in geneva, chairing a conference on nuclear fission. yes, that should stick.
homer, this is an exact replica of your workstation. now, we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.
relax, it's just a simulator. nothing can go wrong.
i like to put my feet up.
college? barber or clown?
i think this is a great opportunity. you could learn so much.
homer, sign this application and you're a shoe-in.
dad, don't let these application essays throw you. let's see... "list your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."
no.
no.
you the man, homer.
i dunno, dad. don't you have a better picture?
oh, don't worry, i've expelled those rowdy members of chug-a-lug house.
g-rrrrr!
well, pop, what are you gonna do?
you don't know, do you?
three days.
homer, that isn't very nice.
hi there, hello, i'm dean peterson, but you can call me bobby. i just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from studying or whatever, i'm always up for some hackey sack. or hey, if you just want to come by and jam, i used to be the bass player for "the pretenders."
now, we'll begin by - oops...
no.
homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.
this proton accelerator de-stabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it...
well please, come down and show us.
hello?
stop the humanoid!
and the words to every monty python routine... we are the knights who say nee! nee! nee! nee!
listen to yourself, man. you're hangin' with nerds.
dad, nerds are nothing to fear. in fact they've done some pretty memorable things. some nerds of note include; popcorn magnate, orville redenbacher, rock star, david byrne and supreme court justice david souter.
come on, mr. simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't know the periodic table.
ho. including all known lanthanides and actinides? good luck!
if you're going for a ride i'd like you to take bart and lisa.
meet sir oinks-a-lot, the beloved mascot of springfield a&m. here he is presiding over last year's homecoming. here he is conferring an honorary degree on richard nixon. and here he is rolling in his own filth. gentlemen, i propose we kidnap sir oinks-a-lot...
mr. simpson, i don't think he likes that.
huh, i can't believe that worked.
it's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- can't we do something?
why does it have to be zany?
prank?
well, i'm touched by your honesty. and who knows, perhaps i've been a bit of an ogre myself.
we really want to thank you, mr. simpson.
what are you gonna do mr. simpson?
or, with our help you could cram like you've never crammed before.
aw, man, i can't believe you failed.
mr. simpson, there is a way. we could... well, use a computer to change your grade.
an "a plus"! how did you do it?
way to go, dad!
no we didn't.
no you didn't. you only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong.
par-ty down?
what? homie!
what's wrong?
where is that dreaded piñata?
actually, mom, a tweaking of mr. burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn dad a special place in the old man's heart.
does either of you know what incontinent means?
come on dear. it's time to go.
homer! you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss.
oh... that poor dog.
quiet, you awful man!
what!
how dare you!
yes'm. dad, i know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.
the burns bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. it could be in your house. you could be looking at it right now. it could be right in front of your face as i'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.
bobo. it's mr. burns' bear all right.
no. let's send burns the eye in the mail. he'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
may i offer you a drink?
how much do you want?
done. now, give me that bear.
you've made a mistake, simpson.
have you been up all night eating cheese?
excuse me wanted to see the guy who valued the happiness of his children over money.
aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.
homer simpson, report for much worse duties.
i don't hate you, i'm proud of you. you came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.
two plus two is four / two plus two is four.... / two plus two is four....
what's that you say? you can live without television as long as you have beer?
homer, give him what he wants.
please... please.
eh, don't worry, i'm sure i'll remember it.
and next in our fall catalogue: we love this, it is a vision in raspberry cream.
well, that can be arranged.
now remember: the instant you finish it, i own your soul for --
technically no, but --
you are not smarter than me! i'll see you in hell yet, homer simpson!
homer?! did you eat that donut?
well! have all the donuts in the world!!
homer! are you all right?
no.
homer, stop picking at it.
we come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. to even gaze upon it is to go mad.
no, no, they're wrong! the creature they seek is the walking undead. nosferatu! das wampyre! a vampire!
oh, i'm very excited about this deal... oh... precious blood.
lisa, stop being so suspicious. did everyone wash their necks like mr. burns asked?
i heard that!
eww, dad, this is blood.
hello, mother. hello, father. i missed you during my uneventful absence.
lisa, it's not like you have a choice here.
this is dangerous. i wish we could have found a sitter for maggie.
no, dad.
you must drive this stake right through his heart.
uh, dad, that's his crotch.
maybe it's the tv.
what the hell...? oooh, we got a call.
i'd like to pledge thirty dollars. oh, thank you!
they need our support. besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet.
that's one right there.
mr. simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium?
hey, homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home?
gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh?
let's get outta here!
homer, this is never easy to say. i'm gonna have to saw your arms off.
homer, are you just holding onto the can?
"mrs. simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."
heh, heh. oh marge, we should do this every thursday.
what's so special about it?
i don't know.
i'm not sure.
don't wait up.
rock the casbah!
sure dad.
hey, dad, i think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter.
blast that infernal card! don't give that card to me.
mr. simpson. i was just going through your garbage and i couldn't help overhearing that you need a baby-sitter. of course being a highly skilled attorney, my fee is one hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour.
three.
okay, two. and i get to keep this old bird cage.
ahhh. there's nothing like moonshine from your own still. oh, simpson! what are you doing here?
we're in pursuit of two female suspects. one is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair.
that's exactly how dillinger got started.
mmmm, engine block eggs. if we can keep these down, we'll be sittin' pretty.
homer?!
you're right. i am lucky to have him.
ha! and to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill.
lionel hutz, aka miguel sanchez, aka doctor nguyen van thoc, was paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of baby-sitting. he was glad to get it. marge simpson was charged with a violation of penal code section 618a, wanton destruction of precious antique cans. she was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and $2,000 in punitive damages and mental anguish. homer simpson was remanded to the custody of the united states army neuro-chemical research center at fort meade maryland for extensive testing.
why do you read that "free" column, homer? they never have anything good.
what is it?
hey! that seltzer ain't free.
that's me. you here for the trampoline?
you're a good dog, arencha, boy? arencha?
i don't know if this is a good idea.
are you sure it's safe?
it smells funny in there.
homer, this is terrible!
i told you this was a bad idea!
dad. dad! you really want to get rid of this trampoline?
let's jump on the car instead.
i can name ten things! i... i made sloppy joes...
um... uh, well... uh...
i'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
that video really opened my eyes. i can see that i'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. by nagging you when you do foolish things, i just enable your life-script.
i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
i'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance.
good. i'm glad we had this talk.
brad goodman is coming to town!
food goes in here.
that means no, eh? i'm not so old-fashioned. your parents have done a fantastic job. mama, papa -- could you come up here?
arr! this picture'll serve me well on those lonely nights at sea.
i didn't feel like it.
they're headin' for the old mill!
no! self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. it's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.
you tell me, chief. you had a pretty good view from behind your desk.
what does that mean, exactly?
homer, i have to go out to pick up something for dinner.
money's too tight for steak.
sure, steak.
it's a hell-of-a--- towwwnnn!!
don't do what donny don't does. they could've made this clearer. they won't let you have any fun.
homer, you should be more supportive.
homer!
oh, no. me bring homer on a rafting trip?
dad, i really want you to come on this trip with me!
arrr, here be a fine vessel. the yarest river-goin' boat there be.
okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. two dads to a raft.
now what happened to that gosh darn map i brought?
paddle harder, homer. we gotta fight the current.
hey! i got that for my birthday!
again? homer, we have to ration the water carefully. it's our only hope.
homer! no!
well, at least ned is trying! what are you doing to help?
stop it! / stop it! / dad!
a rescue plane! get the flare gun!
come back! come back! oh, we're done for! we're done for! we're done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily...
you know, homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food.
godspeed, li'l doodle.
a real swiss army knife. cool!
dad, i know i've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. if i had the strength to lift my arms, i'd give you a hug.
hey, wait! i smell hamburgers too.
that's what you're smelling, homer! oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!
close the damn thing down! no one's ever gonna come.
you did it, dad! you saved us! i'm proud you're my father.
yeah, ditto.
ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
have a good night, homer.
seems okay. anybody see the game last night?
yeah.
hey, joey joe joe!
"your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. talk to the woman, and you'll realize you have nothing in common."
can't talk... eating.
not me. that's my idea of heaven.
really? i can see i'm gonna love working with you. well, gotta go. i wanna sneak in a quick nap before lunch.
i guess we'll be going down together. i mean getting off together. i mean...
think unsexy thoughts. think unsexy thoughts.
hi, dad.
dad, look, i made fish sticks. they're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out.
that raccoon stole my lamb chop.
oh that's sweet. guess what. there's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a t-shirt. i got two dollars off because mine got smeared.
homer, i'm your guardian angel. i've assumed the form of someone you would recognize and revere - sir isaac newton.
oh, very well.
i'm not actually col. klink. i'm just assuming his form.
i'm so happy, darling.
let's get out of here! sure, life is good for you, but what about marge?
dad, why are you singing?
are you hiding something from me?
judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named mindy... or a man named andy.
huh?
hi, homer.
come on, i'll get you the tickets.
what is it? do you have a question?
free shower curtain!
wow, if it weren't for this wall we'd be sleeping in the same bed.
homer, i got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.
no, homer. let's do it. let's call room service!
no more chernobyls!
and now the moment you've been waiting for. this year's king and queen of energy are... homer simpson and mindy simmons!
homer, mindy, you've just won a romantic dinner alone, at madame chao's, the sexiest chinese restaurant in capital city!
what a perfect evening. it was sure nice of them to make us cheeseburgers.
this was a really nice night, homer.
what's wrong?
oh... well, we don't have to.
well, desserts aren't always right.
this was a wonderful idea, homie. hey, there's a turkey behind the bed.
dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you.
this could be a whole new beginning for springfield.
dad, what do you think?
hey! i said bug off!
yee ha! homer, i want you to have my lucky hat. i wore it the day kennedy was shot, and it allllways brings me good luck!
hi, homie.
i was for the casino!
definitely have to leave the table.
gotta watch wapner. leave the table. yeah, leave the table.
ewww!
i'll catch up to you.
yeah.
go home. you're bad luck!
there's nothing to eat for breakfast.
maybe mom just doesn't realize we miss her. we could go down to the casino and let her know.
mommm!
i just had a bad dream.
well, i know it's absurd, but i dreamed the boogeyman was after me and he's hiding...
what happened here?
dad, mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the geography pageant is tonight.
but dad, if i don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of florida, i'll be the laughing stock of the whole school.
dad!
i'm not a state, i'm a monster!
what?
lisa's costume. homer, i didn't realize. i'm so sorry.
you know, you're right, homer. maybe i should get some professional help.
that's true. will you forgive me?
homer!
wake up, dad! wake up! there was a burglar and he took my saxophone.
and my necklace.
homer! that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom.
homer, tell your child what you bought when i sent you to town to get some insurance.
oh, stop blaming the beans.
and don't take candy from strangers.
what's the point of all these precautions? i've already lost the only thing that matters to me.
thank you.
hey, you're that drunken posse. wow, can i join you?
yeah! someone else! someone else! someone else!
he's right!
and a fine job ye did too!
i don't think the guns are a good idea, homer.
oops.
so, wedding, huh?
how now brown bureaucrats.
hey, see this sign?
meaning what exactly?
it's not just a megaphone, dad. it's a rapmaster 2000.
sears.
i got one.
it makes me feel like a big man.
dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? i mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?
world domination?
mr. simpson, how do you respond to the charge that petty vandalism such as graffiti is down 80 percent, while heavy sack beatings are up a shocking 900 percent?
i see. well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?
hello, kent. hello, homer, my arch nemesis.
no, homer, i'm not your wife, although i do enjoy her pearls. as a matter of fact, i'm holding them right now. listen.
homer, that's our stage manager!
it may interest you to know that for my next crime i'll be pinching the pride and joy of the springfield museum, the world's largest cubic zirconia.
son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg.
how's that?
how's that?
i believe you, dad.
you let me down, man. now i don't believe in nothing no more. i'm going to law school.
molloy said, 'i'll catch up with you.' i couldn't quite put my finger on it. there was something strange about the way he walked. much more vertical than usual. and finally, molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.
what an eyesore.
homer old chum. well done. if anyone was going to catch me, i'm glad it was you.
i suppose you're wondering where i hid all the millions of dollars i stole over the years.
big t, huh?
it's just a piece of paper.
uh, how're we gonna get outta here?
why are you so happy?
i've got a weekend job helping the poor. and i'm only eight.
well...
hey, what's a-matter with you, you crazy kid? you a-chasin' away my a-business. hey, pepe, go for the face!
dad, i'm asking if i can get a job.
thanks dad, that's great advice.
but inside it's mostly about ross perot. and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial.
like what?
obnoxious fad?
dad, there's more to me than just a catchphrase.
watch the conan o'brien show. you'll see.
if anyone wants me i'll be in my room.
silly customer! you cannot hurt a twinkie! jiminy cricket, whew, expired ham! well, this time i've gone too far. no, no one will fall for...
okay, ten pounds.
good evening. here's an update on last week's nursing home expose: "geezers in freezers." it turns out the rest home was adequately heated, the footage you saw was of a fur storage facility. we've also been told to apologize for using the term "geezers." now coming up next, "the case of the cantankerous old geezer."
if you have a consumer complaint, just call this number...
dad, are you listening to me?
all right, all right, all right. would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?
your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet.
hot diggity dog! we've got him, mr. simpson. now lets -- mr. simpson?
yo, check this out. black guys drive a car like this. yeah, but white guys, see they drive a car like this.
you know, now that i think about it, it may be a little confusing. many have died needlessly. i have come to make amends. at first i blamed you for squealing, but then i realized it was i who wronged you. so i have come to work off my debt. i am at your service.
i am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.
yes, he's raking leaves.
if he wants to make it up to you so badly, i think you should let him.
a napkin.
relax, please. you do not have anything i have not seen before. what the...?
and he taught me how to play the shenai.
thank you all for the kind praise.
let's hurl a bricky-mart!
not me!
i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
who needs the kwik-e-mart? i do.
but, sir, the head office is in india.
dad... that's over ten thousand miles away.
no.
no.
there she is, there she is, the world's first convenience store.
that's great, because all i need is one.
yes.
yes.
how did it go?
do you mind? i'm not in the mood.
yes... yes, a movie, yes.
awww.
...i leave these. a box of mint-condition nineteen eighteen liberty-head silver dollars. ya see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in zeppelins dropping coins on people. and one day, i seen j.d. rockefeller flyin' by, so i run out of the house with a big washtub and... where're you goin'?
that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie.
all right, come on, pops. soldiers won't bother you anymore.
boo!
there are too many leaves in your walkway! why are you people avoiding me? does my withered face remind you of the grim specter of death?
yeah, you made us march in that gay rights parade.
it's rotten being old. no one listens to ya.
dad, did you hear something?
clean, clean, pistol, uzi, two kids posing as an adult... hey, homer.
except forrrrr...
yeah, how come?
i'm sorry, homie.
unbelievable! and just imagine the logistics of weightlessness. and of course this could have literally millions of applications here on earth... in everything from watch making to watch repair.
and we laugh legitimately. there's a mathematician, a different kind of mathematician and a statistician.
oh no, not another boring space launch! change the channel! change the channel!
god, i wish there was an easier way.
how did you get this number?
are you the person that called nasa yesterday?
well, welcome aboard. i think you'll find that this will win you the respect of your family and friends.
uh... question for the barbecue chef: don't you think there is an inherent danger in sending under-qualified civilians into space?
no, not that far from shame.
you know, homer, when i found out about this i went through a wide range of emotions. first i was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do.
hi homer, since they made me stop drinking, i've regained my balance and diction. observe. i am the very model of a modern major general / i've information vegetable, animal, and mineral.
second comes right after first. so barney, we hear you're kickin' ass.
gentlemen, you've both worked very hard, and in a way you're both winners. but in another more accurate way, barney is the winner.
well, homer. i guess you're the winner by default.
homer, when i met you, you weren't an astronaut. you didn't even know how to use a touchtone. but i still respected you, and i always will, no matter what. homer, you already dialed.
mission control, this is corvair, launch sequence initiated. all systems go.
all right, here we go: three, two, one, make hatch blow...now!
with that hatch open, we'll burn up on reentry. that's it! if i go, i'm taking you to hell with me.
wait, homer. if that bar holds, we just might make it back to earth.
aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod.
hey, dad... sell you these for fifty bucks.
those aren't tickets to the game, homer.
with the money you would have made working, you could've bought tickets from a scalper.
that was bobby mcferrin's new one, "i'm worried, need money!" okay, if you want two tickets to the big pigskin classic just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller!
i've got two tickets to paradise / won't you pack your bags to leave tonight /
what's so special about this game anyway? it's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville. they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. they made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
hidilly ho, neighbor. wanna go to the game with me? i got two tic...
homer, that's not god, that's just a waffle that bart tossed up there.
are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
well, get out the crayolas and color me tickled pink! oh, what's with the lead pipe? were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?
what?
wow, these are amazing seats, huh homer?
relax, homer, i keep tellin' ya, you're my guest.
stan, stan, he's our boy, if he can't do it, no one ...will.
heh-heh, yeah.
hidilly ho, stanster.
sure. anything for neddie. here you go.
ooo, i guess it's time for me to duck again.
homer, that's our wedding photo.
heydilly ho, window buddy. just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl.
that's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?
now, boys, mr. simpson is the guest. he gets to decide what to watch.
good night, daddy. good night, uncle homer.
honey, i'm so glad you're home--
homer, i-i'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night i do my charity work.
oh, you poor, unfortunate man. let's get you out of those clothes immediately. and we'll do whatever we can about the smell.
homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at moe's tonight.
...and then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women.
that was you!
no way, josé !
well\well\well...w-w-w-well\well\well...
how are my boys doin', homer?
we're headin' back. todd's got zesty italian in his eye.
oh, i don't know...
oh lord, please give me the strength to endure homer simpson's friendship.
oh! almost. boy that was close.
no, i-i mean just the flanders family.
i can't, it's a geo!
i think we should leave.
before i get started on today's sermon entitled , "what ned did," i'd like to publicly congratulate homer simpson on his recent charity work.
hi-diddly ho, neighbor.
okilly-dokilly.
hi, mom.
think you'll win?
i think you'll find that escape is impossible. now each one of you take a floor and get started.
amen, ernie.
you're not done. i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides.
shazam!
wah-wah.
homer, what's going on down there?
then stop screaming so loud.
well, hot dog! we have a "wiener"!
i want the elephant.
you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
uh, gentlemen, i am not leaving without my elephant. hey!
homer, it looks like it could gore.
i think i'm gonna call him stampy.
he's hungry. here you go, stampy. eat it slow. it has to last for... you ate it too fast.
you can't do that, dad. it's cruel.
i think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.
strip the bark now, stampy.
no.
no, dad. he's grooming him.
ew, homer, there is a bird on your head?
i think they're trying to get some attention.
technically, it's for a giraffe, but i think i can let it out a little.
you'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
we'll pay you money.
stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
yes. but we paid you four dollars.
no, dad, he's my friend!
well sir, i'll be honest with you. i need a large african elephant. and i need it today. but i'm afraid this just isn't what i'm lookin' for.
it's perfect, dad.
well we really can't offer you any money. we're a non-profit organization.
well, we like to think of it as --
you know i really think --
dad, you can't do this. stampy is my friend.
i'll take that one, too.
all right, i'll be back in the morning to pick up stampy.
elephants don't have keys.
a female deer.
dad, i can't let you sell him. stampy and i are friends. ow. anyway, i want him to go to that animal refuge.
dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
get a rope, bart!
thanks, stampy. ow!
dad, feline means cat. dad!
thanks, dad.
congratulations homer simpson! you've just won the employee raffle!
the job of industrial chimney sweep for a day!
so much for plan b.
uh, sure. i've gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors. ah, one more.
so pick, please, me... mr. burns.
no it's not.
excellent.
i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now. isn't there something you'd like to say?
dad, mr. burns hasn't passed away yet.
well, i --
are you thinking what i'm thinking?
all right.
oh yuck, meatloaf! my most hated of all loafs.
no! this family stinks. mr. burns nurtures my destructive side. i'm suffocating here.
oh, go eat some flowers.
smithers, my plan worked perfectly. bart simpson will live here as my son, and i will mold him in my own graven image. who knows, i may even grow to love him. bartholomew! ugh! smithers get it off me.
that was a heartbreaker. but i did get paul mccartney out of "wings."
homer, that's hans moleman.
let me try one.
huh! what a coincidence. and a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty. go ahead bartholomew. you may fire when ready. hurry! fire him now or i'll disown you. you'll lose everything. the fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury, the gift certificate from blockbuster video, the freedom to do whatever you want.
i love you guys.
cowabunga, dudes.
yeah, i guess it is guilt.
well, yeah, but --
ned, homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school's being run.
well, once he found out we were going to get ned flanders fired, he insisted on helping.
can't let dad see me playing hooky.
good afternoon.
give those glasses to the bailiff.
we might as well make it official.
if the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world.
it's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
let's vote. my liver is failing.
justice is not a frivolous thing, simpson. it has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. now let's vote.
you know, we're kind of like the original "odd couple." you're the messy one and i'm...
ew, what a mess.
ah. is that my necktie you're wearing?
good for you, homie. you know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone.
homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting maggie's birthday cake.
hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! i made a special cake for you to ruin. it's over there.
homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely.
yeah. anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. "periodicals," that's it.
homer, would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet?!
pardon me, sir. forgive my clumsiness.
bart! homer, what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love?
hot diggity! i'm gonna smooch her like a mule eatin' an apple! i even bought me some special novelty dentures.
oh, i see. so if i take your advice / and make your patented move / then my chances for love / will slightly improve?
whoop-de-doo, tarantula town! whoop-de-doo, employees! everyone who's found true love may leave early today!
hello! why it's... it's uh... oh it's... why it's fred flintstone and his lovely wife, wilma! oh, and this must be little pebbles! mind if i come in? i brought chocolates.
he's an awful, awful, awful man, but i guess if he makes mom happy, that's all that really matters.
dad, i'm really sorry, but i charged three hundred fifty dollars on your credit card.
don't worry, here's the cash.
evil-schmevil, marge. monty can provide for me, and besides, he's a great kisser.
homer, do you want any cards? homer?
do you want another card or not?
i'm in. let's see your cards.
we don't think you're slow. but, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything.
oh homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better.
... there's that. or, you could take an adult education course.
that's because you were drunk!
what is your area of expertise?
no you can't, mr. simpson. no one can.
oh, you're married?
no, mr. simpson, what i mean is, we may have a job for you after all. we need someone to teach a course on how to build a successful marriage.
i think it's great you're a teacher, dad. so, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation?
well, homer, what a pleasant...
can i take your order?
sir, it's a felony to tease the order box.
um, how about if we tell you our problems with relationships?
mr. simpson, are you listening? simpson!
you were not! you were just eating a damn orange!
he's a horrible excuse for an educator.
trouble in paradise, huh? derisive laugh)
marge dyes her hair?
homer, i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class.
today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair.
homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again.
tell us more about you and marge.
i can't believe i paid ten thousand dollars for this course! what the heck was that lab fee for?
oh, all right. / okay.
homer, don't you have to get to class?
what the darn...?
apparently that disturbing odor was the food.
i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
what the hell are you talkin' about? you're the one who double dared us.
me too.
get out! get out! get out!
you, too.
you just don't get it, do you, homer? you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. i can't trust you anymore.
hey, homer, what's the big brouhaha? ha.
affirmative, humanoid.
sorry, bart, your dad kinda blew the fantasy. i only like it when i'm pretend scared.
here, dad. i brought you some nice...
dad, that's just a plant.
look, i brought you some nice pudding.
dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. there's a reason two people come together and stay together. there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. if you want to get mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can.
good luck, dad.
'kay. clean house, no silverfish... i coulda been very happy here. homer!
i didn't ask her for no water. she's lying, homer, she's lyin'. she told me you were dead. that's the only reason i... i didn't do nothin'!
homer, what happened to you?
homer, that's not a good thing.
but, how do i know i can trust you?
look, dad. i missed you so much, i couldn't concentrate in school and i got an "f".
and i have a special present for you, but i'll give it to you later tonight.
homer, my hat goes off to you.
homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. although i must say, it's certainly refreshing.
won't this overload the motor?
dad... dad... dad...
over here we have "the hick tub," "the uh insta-rust," that's "the lightning magnet," that's "the tinkler..."
yes, dad.
i'm gonna miss the whole summer.
well, it looks like it's just you and me, barty boy.
this was a lovely idea, homie. come here and kiss me.
listen, ned flanders murdered his wife.
oh, well i guess that explains everything.
um, i'm right here.
oh!
whoa!
homer, that was downright decent of you.
dad, isn't this stealing?
and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
while you were out "earning" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. the plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in monday.
homer?
homer, homer!
hello.
homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?
look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?
ah, very clever, simpson. luring our bees to your sugar pile and then selling them back to us at an inflated price.
oh, wait a minute. the bees are leaving.
i'm sorry, homie.
wake up!
wake up!
homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book.
no, no, no. no, ask your heart what its fondest desire is.
no, think about people. about moments in your life that have been very romantic.
okay, homer.
ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
i guess we'll be goin' down together. i mean getting off togeth-- i mean...
tv's there; bathroom's there; and there's your king sized bed for...
homer, i got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.
no more chernobyls!
this was a really nice night, homer.
what's wrong?
oh... well, we don't have to.
homer, you know how i feel. so it-it's up to you. look in your heart. i think you'll see what you want.
yes, what did happen to her?
well, kids, i tried. maybe you're right.
homer.
you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with.
my prom date.
why so glum?
ah, your first kiss.
yeah. "dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."
now wait a minute. i'm not sure about this. every time we've ever gone on vacation, i end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. you have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time.
well, there was our trip to the amish country...
don't worry, mom. we'll make you proud of us.
dad, can we stop at flickey's?
what's the matter with you, homer? we don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car.
haven't we stood in five different states long enough?
we'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
would you like to buy some itchy and scratchy money?
do it, dad.
bart!
tortureland, explosion land, searing gas pain land, unnecessary surgery land...
dad?
i have nothing to say to you.
how were you a political prisoner?
oh for gosh sakes, what now?
oh my, it looks like we're doomed!
dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits.
hey, mouse! say cheese. hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that i could be an action hero.
as roger meyers jr., the owner of the park, i'd like to thank you for stopping the killer robots. and to show my appreciation, here are two free passes.
yeah, switch the station. i consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable.
dad, i had to listen to this jerk all morning. can we listen to something else?
that sounds like sideshow bob!
dad, i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who sideshow bob is.
when he got out, he married aunt selma and tried to murder her.
homer, we've got to stop them.
yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading archie comics.
i can't tell you who i am, but i worked on the campaign.
homer, i'm impressed. you're taking this quite well.
homer!
so what'll it be, homer?
no. not unless you kill your family.
homer! homie? hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness. feelin' fine, well, that's a relief. this is less encouraging.
go crazy?
homer, it's moe. ah, look, some of the ghouls and i are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward.
oh, for cryin' out loud. c'mon.
dad, look!
homer, change channel!
one / singular sensation...
dad!! daaadd!! homer!!
okay, everybody. let's see some big smiles. just relax, let the hooks do their work.
it's bliiiiisssss.
are we taking the new lexus to aunt patty and selma's funeral today?
good morning, dear.
huh?
oh that's sweet, homer. our son is growing up, isn't he?
have you noticed any change in bart?
no. he looks like something might be disturbing him.
that's not what i meant.
well, jessica, i don't think we should hang out together anymore. you're turning me into a criminal when all i want to be is a petty thug.
thirty cents off shake 'n bake. homer!
he confessed!
homer, stop that. i believe him.
that's what he wore to church.
no.
if you search her room, i am certain you will find the money.
lisa, your father and i are very concerned about this warning. i really hope you try harder.
well, i could use a new pair of hockey skates.
that's not fair... why is bart getting a present and i'm getting chewed out?
cheer up. so you're not good at sports. it's a very small part of life.
oh yes, we won! we won! we won! um, unfortunately, since i bet on the other team, ah, we won't be going for pizza.
please, dad, i'll be fine.
i can't even watch. i don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
absolutely, honey. by blocking the net i really think you helped your team.
come watch tv with me, dad. we missed the first two episodes of cops, but if we hurry we can catch the last three.
hey milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! jimbo! jimbo! go for the face! look! ralph wiggum lost his shin guard! hack the bone! hack the bone!
mr. honeybunny!
hm, i better go check that out. now homer, don't you eat this pie.
you'll have to do better than that tonight, chump.
hello.
stop it! stop it! conserve your precious hatred for the game.
no.
hi mom! over here! mom!
ew. bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. they go in the trash.
how did you get tickets?
no,me!takeme!me!me!me!
homer, are all these pockets necessary?
mom! how can you leave us with this maniac?!
mr. goodbar to the front desk... the front desk is looking for mr. goodbar.
as you can see, i have created a lemonball so sour it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field. the candy, known as 77x42 -- where the hell is the candy?
ah, you're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am.
will you two stop saying "gummy" so much.
no. i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further. oooh... how'd they get there?
halt! halt!
i'm sure it'll turn up. take the baby-sitter home now. she's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
i'm sorry?
just drop me off here.
there he is! there's the man that sexually harassed me!
you grabbed me in the car!
boo!
dad, i don't understand. what is she saying you did?
oh, yeah. that was brilliant.
we know you're innocent, dad.
you people aren't allowed in here.
homer--
i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today. i told her you were a decent man. but she wouldn't listen. besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more i can do.
that was really great, mr. simpson, we got everything we need.
homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. it's not gonna happen.
look, maybe this whole thing will blow over.
yes, yes, yes. that's fine. good, good.
this is hour fifty-seven of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside the simpson estate. remember, by the way, to tune in tonight at eight o'clock for highlights of today's vigil, including when the garbage man came, and when marge simpson put the cat out. possibly because it was harassed, we don't know. of course, there's no way to see into the simpson home without some kind of infrared heat-sensitive camera. so let's turn it on. now this technology is new to me, but i'm pretty sure that's homer simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. his body temperature has risen to over four hundred degrees. he's literally stewing in his own juices. now here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95 percent of the people believe homer simpson is guilty. of course, this is just a television poll, which is not legally binding. unless proposition 304 passes, and we all pray it will.
c'mon on let us through, you vultures.
it's just hard not to listen to tv. it's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
ai yi yi! es homer simpson. me ha molestado. ohh!
the media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. all they care about is entertainment. well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word "entertainment" -- public access television.
now it's time for the innocence report with homer simpson.
no, that's mayor quimby. ah, here we go.
hmm. homer, i thought you were an animal, but your daughter said you were a decent man. i guess she was right.
tomorrow on rock bottom. he's a foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least suspect it. he's rowdy roddy peeper.
groundskeeper willie saved you, homer.
hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
is there something wrong, homie?
i simply can't wait that long. maybe we should get some help... how 'bout a book?
a tasteful book.
oh, i'm just reading up on, artillery.
this one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. it's a book on tape by paul harvey, you know, that nice midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of grampa.
the arabian nights room looks nice...
the uh... toilet is overflowing in the uh caveman room!
this isn't very erotic. i think it's an actual utility room.
welcome home, son. i broke two lamps and lost all your mail. what's wrong with your wife?
protein deficiency?
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcano-coniosis?
oh, homey, what's--
here he is, rex harrison and paul anka rolled into one! that tonic really works! you and grampa should bottle it and go into business together.
hurry up! we got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: frigid falls, mount seldom, lake flaccid...
all questions will be answered, all fears will be allayed, with one incontrovertible demonstration! may i have a volunteer from the audience? yes, you, sir! now, sir, you have never seen me before. is that correct?
you're the worst shill i ever seen! you're a disgrace to the medicine show business!
hey, wait a minute. that's amos pierson's moose farm. make a right, here.
that's 'cause you're a screw-up.
why you little...!
i'm sorry i said that.
homie, are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life?
you tell bart all the time. you told him this morning.
aw, nuts.
dad, number one: i know how to ride a bike. number two: i already own a bike. and number three: that is a girl's bike.
dad!
no offense, homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.
dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary.
no, i'm a screw-up. i burned down our house.
what?
well, i hadn't thought that far ahead. okay, here it goes... i'm not sorry i had you, son. and i was always proud that you weren't a short man.
whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?
do i?! i'm burnin' up, here. ooh, ooh, taking advantage of my alcohol soaked clothes. it's funny and it makes you think. oh i need some coffee before i black out. homer, pass me the sugar.
how many people want homer banned from this place for life? yeah!
oww. ohh...
cheer up, homer.
what if you pretended that this couch were a bar? then you could spend more nights at home with us. huh?
look on the bright side, dad. did you know that the chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?
good evening, sir. would you please leave without a fuss right now?
homer? who is homer? my name is guy incognito.
sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink in here.
where's your uniform?
hey, you're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink here, are you?
hi, i'm alan. i'm your co-pilot.
if word gets out about this, kwazy klown airlines will be a laughing stock. in exchange for your silence, i'm prepared to offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the united states. excluding alaska and hawaii. the freak states.
i don't know, homer. we're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season.
homer, i've never told you this before, but i'm not a good flyer. i have to get off the plane. let me off the plane. i'm asking you nicely to open the doors.
yes, but i'd rather not talk about it.
well, everybody's got a fear of something.
sock puppets.
no, no honey, it's all right. really. i'm fine. i'm all right. mother always said "don't complain. be good. behave, behave. be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."
mm, no, i don't need therapy, i'm fine. and it's too expensive.
thank you for calling "radio psychic." do you have a song request?
dad, mom's getting worse. you have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. look how tense she is.
okay, i will.
fine.
huh, this has nothing to do with you, simpson. i have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother.
if money's a problem, i charge on a sliding scale. i can go as low as thirty dollars an hour.
well...
i don't think so.
ready for breakfast, doctor smith?
warning. warning. doctor smith refuses to do his astro chores.
hm, emergency call. gotta go.
put a pan down there.
yeah, we got uh, things to do.
it's a secret.
oh, homer. don't start stalking people again. it's so illegal. remember when you were stalking charles kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?
i don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
oh well. that was a real nice secret organization we had once.
there are only two ways to gain membership. be the son of a stonecutter...
you got it all wrong, homer. it's not like that.
everyone likes you. you're a wonderful person.
i'm sure it's nothing personal, homer.
i'm a member.
dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore grampa?
i'm a member.
what?
oh sure. let's see... i'm an elk, a mason, a communist... i'm the president of the gay and lesbian alliance for some reason... ah, here it is. the stonecutters.
as soon as number one gets here.
we call each other by number, not by name. carl is number 14, i'm number 12. burnsie is number 29.
thank you, sir, may i have another? patience, monty. climb the ladder.
of this chapter. there are chapters all over the world. and it has been foretold that someday a chosen one will...
this ritual is called "crossing the desert." and this we call "the unblinking eye."
and now the final ordeal: the paddling of the swollen ass... with paddles.
well to be honest, i never got around to ordering that part for ya, so uh, it's still gonna be a couple of weeks.
yes.
same old space, huh, dad?
well... no. we've got the same chair.
your membership pack.
i still don't believe all the founding fathers were stonecutters.
homer, a man who called himself "you know who" just invited you to a secret "wink wink" at the "you know what." you certainly are popular now that you're a stonecutter.
who robs cave fish of their sight? /
thank you. tonight we are here to commemorate our glorious society's 1500th anniversary. and in honor of this momentous occasion, we're having ribs.
homer!
/ that's it!
the mark!
you are the chosen one, whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory. now to the top of mount springfield for the coronation! remove the stone of shame!
remember, dad. all glory is fleeting.
dad, i know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever. don't you see? getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
another strike for the chosen one! hurrah!
absolutely.
no, no, homer. you have a... royal... sampler.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
yay!
you're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
silence! i now call to order the first meeting of the ancient mystic society of nohomers.
homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these colobus monkeys. somebody's gonna get parasites.
i meant our wedding rings.
incorrect. look. a canal.
okay, tv off. it's family time.
all right, family time begins now. homer!
why don't we all look at the photo album?
yeah, yeah, yeah two. let's get to the baby pictures.
get the camera ready, bart very seepy.
attention american workers. your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of free-lance terrorists.
homer! tell the story right.
your paychecks, gentlemen.
hey, what did we do?
is that so?
he's gettin' a pretty good sound outta that guy.
sure.
i don't know if it's such a good idea. can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
fine.
homer...
me too. let's go home.
did you have to be so graphic?
so dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?
daaad!
homer, did you polish your head in the "shine-o ball-o?"
hey, great job, homer. / thanks a lot./ you're the best.
hey, i'm just hangin'. homie, i--
hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. that's nice work, homer.
oh mr. simpson, i have just heard about the little bundle of joy. congratulations, sir.
oh really.
by the way, congratulations on your new job, homer.
wow, dad. you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?
actually, when i was about to have bart...
i'll stay here, but i'm gonna think about products i might like to purchase. ooh, i don't have that.
homer! let your father tell the story.
okay, but i know funny.
homer, you had a head.
oh.
anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little goin' away thing.
see ya 'round, mr. homer.
yes, are you a new applicant?
well, actually -
my contractions started an hour ago.
argh -- you're truly the catch of the day!
one more push should do it.
homie, i think someone is saying hello.
uh, that's the umbilical cord. it's a girl.
so, you loved her right from the start.
then why no pictures?
no, dad, i don't think...
homer, what if this doesn't work?
dad, the plan!
dad!
we're doomed!
turn it off.
wow, dad. maybe you're right.
we have a bomb shelter?
i kinda figured this might happen, so i built the shelter big enough for both our families.
one more hour.
all right!
and it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. um, and someone will have to run the power. uh, you can do that, homer.
say moe, was it a duck?
yeah, dad was right.
finders keepers.
hey, homer. the section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire.
yes, homie?
i don't think any of us expected him to say that.
yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as tom bosley. but krusty!
new hampshire.
okay, memorize these funny place names. walla walla, keokuk, cucamonga, seattle...
and now everybody's favorite, the "spin cycle fantastique" trick. it's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool.
now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? wrong.
this is the happiest day of my life. a-yah-ha.
i'm a boy.
hey, nice threads.
boy, you're really running yourself ragged.
well my time's almost up here, so uh, i'd just like to say i know woody allen.
hey! me too! we can go together.
your churlish attitude reminds me of the time i was having dinner with groucho, and...
well, well, well "velocity boy," i am gonna give you the biggest ticket you... hey! krusty!
oh, to think i was going to give you a ticket! krusty the klown!
i'm not saying it won't work. i'm just saying it's dishonest.
right, boss.
well, i can't give you the car, krusty... but i can let you have this little number for practically nothing. only thirty-eight thousand.
these are speed holes. they make the car go faster.
is that so? well gee... maybe the old flandersmobile could use a... lucky i always keep a bible close to my heart. lucky i was wearing an extra large piece of the true cross today. i think i'll go inside.
the same homer simpson who crashed his car through the wall of our club?
the same barney gumbel who keeps taking pictures of my sister?
i am so glad i had a chance to meet you before we did this, krusty, because i am a great-a fan. don vittorio dimaggio.
go! go!
i am confused.
without the loop, it is nothing.
i know i've seen it go the other way. ah, faithful toilet. you'll prove me right. 
hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... i'm being indicted for fraud in australia.
yes'm.
anyway, the "down under" fad fizzled, and the diplomatic climate turned absolutely frosty. oops. let's pretend we didn't see that. and bart's childish taunting agitated the aussies further.
well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign of good faith to our australian friends, we'd like to imprison bart for five years.
no. to combat homesickness, we've installed a device that makes them swirl the correct, american way.
actually, sir, the embassy is considered american soil, sir.
homer, that's enough.
all right, all right, you win. i see you've played knife-y spoony before.
well, you're free to go, bart. right after your additional punishment.
well, a mere apology would be a bit empty, eh? let the booting begin!
yuh-oh.
mr. simpson, shhsh! disparaging the boot is a bootable offense. it's one of their proudest traditions.
liiiiisa!
thank you, bart. i promise i won't make fun of you later for this.
yeah, homer. what's your secret investment?
uh, pumpkins?
hello, homer.
yeah, homer, let your wife have a glimpse of success, for once.
i'm sorry. homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man.
i wish you wouldn't put homer down like that. he may not be a big success like you, but i can always count on him to provide for the family.
why would you need to see it? you're the genius who invented... the product in question.
now don't worry. you'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.
homer! homer, wake up. there's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime.
money problems? homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?
i understand that, mr. simpson. but according to our computer, your credit history is not good. it says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. it also says that you once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like a vacuum cleaner.
yeah, well it all goes on your permanent record. i'm sorry, but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow-- the bank is going to take your house.
well we'll look for the house with no numbers.
well then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.
now bring us some extra chairs, like a good blubber-in-law!
it means...
this has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. i'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, montreal morn.
oh, our fun hasn't begun yet.
let's go, homer. on the way home, we're all stopping at moe's for a zima.
am i wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?
permission pending. first, light our cigarettes.
c'mon, homer. you can't spell obsequious without "iou."
ah-ah-ah-ah! just for that you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.
what's going on in here?
what's that paper?
homer, is this projection accurate? did you borrow money from my sisters?
homer, homer why didn't you tell me?
not too good, lisa. frankly, he's underneath the table.
but i like to make you breakfast.
dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival.
i didn't turn it on. i thought you turned it on.
uhm, thanks.
homer, it's not that easy. it takes the genius of carl reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and i...
evening simpson... you got a short in your taillight. it started blinkin' when you made that turn. let's see your chauffeur's license.
well, well, well. look who needs us again to get his chauffeur's license.
failed to check blind spot, minus two points.
ooh, seat belt twisted, minus one point.
grazed a cone, minus five points.
well uh, we.... uh... she uh...
wait a minute, those are yours, sir?
both of them?
homer, i'm -- i'm speechless. you just saved our hides.
if there's anything we can do to make it up...
or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test.
uh... well...
no, homer.
hello, i'm bart simpson. in the past, i've brought you such classic films as "homer in the shower," and "homer on the toilet." and now, i give you... "the eternal struggle."
i like him. he's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance...
uh, i wasn't talking about you, dad.
"you can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."
oh, nice to meet you, marge. i saw your hair from the plane. and you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil.
uh oh. i smell another cheap cartoon crossover.
homer, the guest should get the last pork chop.
thank you!
muh... muh... muh...
making out the jury list for the film festival. mayor quimby -- krusty -- jay --
yes.
no reason.
you don't have to do this.
i don't think you're stupid.
next.
hans moleman productions presents "man getting hit by football."
i think we have a winner.
two to two. well, homer, it all comes down to you.
why don't we all take a five minute break? it'll clear our heads.
how many times have i heard rex reed say that?
don't cry for me. i'm already dead.
beer here!
homie, you voted for the right movie. i'm glad you were on the jury.
yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.
whatever.
...except for the international market it's my...
hey, hey there with the personal calls simpson.
homer, don't take this personally, but i've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding.
now throw compost on it!
oh, still warm.
homer! bart! maggie! company eating rules.
anyway, hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. i also crush cars into cubes. and on the side, i promote local tough man contests. basically i'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til i go to law school.
maggie! don't talk with your mouth full.
hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
that's true.
you know, fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, i didn't even notice.
hi, dad.
thanks.
dad, you're babbling.
hey, dad. did you forget to give those cufflinks to hugh?
hi, dad.
wow!
wow. what else did you do, dad?
who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
my strobe light!
yes, the dog...
homer, hold on to the wheel!
hey!
oh, this place is so big. do you think we should split up and look for them, homie? homie?
and they're off! she's the fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead!
as they round the far turn, it's she's the fastest, followed by always comes in second and i'm number three...
aww...
oh, homie, aren't they adorable?
look at branford ii! isn't that cute? he thinks he's one of the models, inc.
yeeesch! this house stinks! you're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?
yeah, they ate all my socks! i have to wear lisa's to school today!
nooooooo!
all right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. as long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. on a completely unrelated topic, i'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight.
...and i know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets...
she's right, homer. there's something about his face i don't trust.
but dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive.
relax? i can't relax. nor can i yield, relent, or... only two synonyms? oh my god! i'm losing my perspicacity!
i'm worried about the kids, homie. lisa's becoming very obsessive. this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat.
that's it. we have to get them back to school.
there's no way i'll get into an ivy league school now. at this rate i probably won't even get into vassar.
no thanks to you, homer.
um, the guy who chopped up george washington?
mom, i think he's serious.
hot dogs! get your hot dogs here!
now homer, please. the boy has just had a very serious operation.
bleeding gums was my hero and i never got to tell him how i felt.
but he was the only person who had the same love for music that i do. thank you. oh dad, why did he have to die?
yeah.
oh, dad!
lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and bleeding gums was a good friend to you. but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them.
saxophone! he was a jazz musician. you didn't know him! nobody knew him! but he was a great man! and i won't rest until all of springfield knows the name of bleeding gums murphy!
that's mary had a little lamb.
aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
ah, c'mon, homer, there's lasers. you like lasers.
devilishishly satirical. i wonder if anyone else got that?
homie, these games are fixed.
somebody stop him! he's getting away!! c'mon! c'mon!
we'll try to make it twelve.
ah, i think i'm okay. it was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating.
i borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?
you got it, little buddy.
homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. you'll always be the man of this house.
wow, mom, i never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before.
mom's police tape isn't a toy, dad.
bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... oh my lord!! something horrible has happened!
oh.
yeah.
hey, homer, you sure it's okay to smoke cuban cigars and gamble here now that your uh, wife's a cop?
homer, please, please, ix-nay on the ohammar-may.
c'mon, put that away. those radar guns give you cancer.
we'll be goin'... / we'll just be goin'... / we don't want no trouble, officer...
i'm still all those things. only now i'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system.
everywhere i look, someone is breaking the law. dog, no leash. man littering. horse not wearing diaper. car parked across three handicapped spaces... homer!
homer, i'm on duty.
you have to move your car.
oh, that's it. i'm gonna write you a ticket.
you're breaking the law.
homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.
you have the right to remain silent...
i'm sorry i had to arrest you, homer. but what i did was right. someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there.
hey, homer, i'm worried about the beer supply. after this case and the other case, there's only one case left. yeah, yeah, barney's right. / yeah. / let's get some more beer. / hey what about some beer? / yeah, barney's right!
i'll, i'll-i'll get it, homer.
"garage?" hey fellas - "the garage". ooo la de da, mr. frenchman.
not so fast.
maybe you should just stop entirely.
no, it's officer simpson - of the police!
homer!
so long, gotta catch the 501.
that's my ambulance! i called for it four hours ago.
that the pants would rip?...
that's some nice work, simpson. but um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence.
death to shelbyville!
isn't there anything we can do?
well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the...
keep your voices down, boys. we didn't come this far to get found out.
bust in here and take it? you must be stupider than you look.
there's got to be a way to get that tree back. hey, look. a hospital! pull in there.
i'll get the gate.
it won't start! something's draining the battery?!
precisely.
my name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! smithers, who is this nincompoop?
well, um, yeah. i guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?
i have an idea.
oh, no. that's awful, mr. puente. what? oh. he owns the nuclear power plant. yeah, i'd like to settle his hash, too. dad, how can you work for a man like mr. burns?
"marge, bart, lisa, and maggie." dad, this doesn't have your name on it.
who is that bafflewit? / ...lummox? / puddinghead? / mooncalf? / limpnoodle? / goldbricker? drizzlepuss? / cueball? / fumblefist? / galoot?
look out!
what? what are you talking about? clearly make sense, man. i can't understand a word you're saying. you're just babbling incoherently like some sort of...
he robbed the school of tito!
everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr. burns. even us. bart, he broke your dog's legs. grampa, he destroyed your home. and dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name.
could not!
hey, homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down burns' sun blockin' machine. you wanna come with?
actually, mom, in 95% of cases, it is. the rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.
who the devil are you?
who wants chocolate ice cream?
okay, mom. anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. like those fingerprints. they could've gotten on the gun some other way. are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
homer simpson?
homer simpson.
ho-mer simp... son. ho... mersimp... son.
bart, why are you talking like that?
yeah.
you're right, lis. i can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to god.
we'll run that cable through here.
eh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together.
you saying we're not working?
enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself.
you did the right thing by telling me. shoo! get outta here!
well, you'll notice how the heated gas pedal warms your feet while -- ...gently massages your buttocks. well, count homer, shall we discuss the--
homie, this is so sweet. but i can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess...
what about maggie?
don't do that!
yes. they should be here. those parents better have a good excuse.
parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
oh, bitch, bitch, bitch.
i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. that is so like me.
no, i don't care for children.
and margaret?
it's maggie!
i can see you sincerely want your children back. but you have a lot to learn about being parents. before i can return your children, you'll have to complete a course called family skills. it teaches parents to listen to their...
but there's more to it than...
mr. simpson, would you please --
this is so humiliating.
it's so quiet here without the kids.
you mean maggie?
we've never been separated from the kids for so long. i don't know how much more i can take. there's bart's ring!
paw, i cut myself on the screen door again.
i love you, paw!
where we going? where we going?
do you reject satan, and all his empty promises?
wow, dad, you took a baptismal for me. how do you feel?
wait, homer. what did you just say?
so, what was it like at the flanders' house?
there was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though.
yeah. family restaurants. that's where the big bucks are. i could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?
so come on. i need a name that says friendly, all-american cooking.
oh boy. the deep fryer's here. i got it used from the navy. you can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.
nothing.
come to uncle moe's for family fun / it's good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
hiya, folks! welcome to uncle moe's! aw, look at all the cute little minors.
i can't take this anymore. i want my soul and i want it now!
yeah. yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better.
what?
are we there yet?
are we there yet?
just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
what a load of crappy-crap-crap.
that's it, honey. get into the spirit.
hidilly ho, neighboreeno!
can i come?
well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.
i can't eat this. i can't eat a poor little lamb!
no.
no!
dad... those all come from the same animal.
say what? cartoons don't have messages, lisa. they're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. stuff like that.
dad, can't you have some other kind of party? one where you don't serve meat?
hey, homer. thanks for inviting me to your barbecue.
ahh. diagnosis: delicious.
hey homer, wing me another one of them burgers, would ya? i can't quite seem to stand up under my own power anymore.
congratulations, homer. your q is a huge success. a toast to the host who can boast the most roast.
it's gone.
give it up, dad. piggy ain't comin' back.
i'm never ever apologizing because i was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to my room.
tell him yourself. you're ignoring lisa, not bart.
homer, you're not not talking to me. and secondly, i heard what you said.
uh, dad, lisa's the one you're not talking to.
why don't you just eat him, dad.
hi, dad. looking for me?
while i was gone, i got some really good advice from paul and linda mccartney.
i still stand by my beliefs, but i can't defend what i did. i'm sorry i messed up your barbecue.
sorry, sir. no refunds.
homer! where did you get that?
that giant donut.
help me! help me, lord!
homer! just give him the donut. once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror.
even as i speak, the scourge of advertising could be heading toward your town. lock your doors. bar your windows. because the next advertisement you see could destroy your house and eat your family.
it was only a dream. 
yes.
it all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. we were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
sorry, dad. this is our spot.
nuh-uh, 'cause we called it.
well, we're calling it now.
'fraid so.
you're gonna help us clean and organize 'em. and pry out all the dead hermit crabs. get a screwdriver.
hey! you can just suck 'em out!
homer? where are you?
do you see towels? if you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again.
we better call ned. he has a ladder.
hunh. it's like he just disappeared into fat air.
move into the light, my son.
homer, this is your physician, dr. julius hibbert. can you tell us what it's like in there?
enough of your borax, poindexter! a man's life is at stake! we need action! take that, you lousy dimension!
no, pops, it's too risky. for all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large...
cool, man!
i'll save you, dad. oh, i can't get any closer! you'll have to jump!
hmm... that one!
yeah. every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. especially my big fat mouth.
raise your right hock. aerate! raise your left hock. aerate! i want to see more teddy roosevelts and less franklin roosevelts!
actually, homer, that's just one. see, each push-up includes both an "up" part and a "down" part.
yes?
may i help you?
okay.
you can do it, old boy!
i must protest. you're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
have you told mom about this?
da-ad!
obesity is really unhealthy. any doctor will tell you that.
now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. i recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology.
you'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic.
lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work.
homer, you're... um... on the towel rack.
hi. ah, er, there's something i've been meaning to ask you. did you put on a little weight this week?
have you lost your mind?! have you thought about your health?... or your appearance?
oh please, i would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--
bad news, dad, we're out of food. we're even out of the basic elements of food. you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce.
ah, dad? towel rack...?
... yes, simpson.
work, huh? let me guess: computer programmer? computer magazine columnist? something with computers.
what's the connection? must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. so we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes...
i like school.
dad?
homer, we need to have a serious talk.
let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?
con: you're setting a bad example for the children.
con: you're running the air conditioner non-stop. it's freezing in here.
con: i am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
good. good for you.
dad, what are you doing down there?
hey, leave my dad alone. just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. he's a sweet man and he has real feelings.
hey, look. he's trying to get up to yell at us.
hey, homer, you promised mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside.
i'm terribly sorry, sir. but i'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs.
well, what i'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't possibly fit in our seats.
hey, fatty! i got a movie for ya -- "a fridge too far."
hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac.
workers, please! there'll be time for the frozen pudding wagon later! you still owe me ten more iroquois twists! ten hi-ya-ya! and nine hi-ya-ya..!
what can i get for thirty cents?
... one hi-ya-ya!
we'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated.
i guarantee it. one... one... one... bah! i'll just pay for the blasted liposuction.
hey, where's homer? how'd he get out of this?
simpson, stop frolicking and get to work!
that dummy worked like a charm, dad.
okay, mr. simpson, i'll just make the change here ...and you're all set.
you sure do.
you awful, awful man. get out of my son's grave.
homer?
oh, my poor baby. you must have been so upset... but i suppose abe has his reasons.
oh, it's a very complicated story. let's just enjoy this moment.
hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: christmases, birthdays, easters, kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... you owe me twenty-two thousand dollars.
homer, don't be so hard on little... what is his name?
me, too. 
mona simpson, mona stevens, martha stewart, penelope olsen, muddy mae suggins... these are the calling cards of a con artist.
she's nice.
i just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. you could get hurt again.
oh, homie. c'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. i'm sure you were a wonderful son.
oh, i had help from my friends in the underground. jerry rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes. i proofread bobby seale's cookbook. and i ran credit checks at tom hayden's porsche dealership.
but i did. i sent you a care package every week.
no. oh, wait. this.
no, dad, it's a rhetorical question.
dad, do you even know what "rhetorical" means?
gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to springfield?
you know, lisa, it might be nice to rest for a while.
well, it's 'cause of your old lady that i got rid of the asthma that was keeping me out of the academy.
yeah, just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose through the ranks of the springfield police to become chief clancy wig --
well, there's my ride. the underground awaits.
oh, hurry up, man. this electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left.
and he tried to murder me.
da-ad! why aren't you looking?
why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. thus, i submit to you: we abolish television. permanently.
i feel so helpless. what if something happens to them?
prepare to engage enemy. bogie's airspeed not sufficient for intercept. suggest we get out and walk.
i'm comin'!
hello, i'm troy mcclure. you may remember me from such fox network specials as "alien nose-job" and "five fabulous weeks of the chevy chase show." tonight we're here to honor america's favorite non-prehistoric cartoon family. you'll see long-lost footage...never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes...old favorites you can't see in syndication... so join me, won't you, for "the simpsons 138th episode spectacular!" "the simpsons" began as the brainchild of cartoonist matt groening,...the already-famous creator of such comics as "damnation," "johnny reb," and "true murder stories". in nineteen eithty-seven, groening teamed up with award-winning producers james l. brooks...and sam simon. and what better place to premier their creation than on "the tracey ullman show" -- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers. on april 19th, 1987, america first met... the simpsons.
um, dad...
thanks, dad.
sweet dreams.
goodnight, dear.
all right, climb in.
they're all gone. the whole batch.
did you eat the cookies, maggie.
go on maggie.
as wacky as those kids were, they were no match for captain wacky -- later renamed "homer."
oops.
over the six years "the simpsons" has been on the air, we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show. tonight we'll answer some of your questions. professor lawrence pierce of the university of chicago writes, "i think homer gets stupider every year." that's not a question, professor. but we'll let the viewers judge for themselves.
okay, mr. burns. uh, what's your first name?
well homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
careful, they're ruffled!
go crazy?
i'll take a hit, dealer. joker? you're supposed to take those out of the deck!
oh, sure. i read all about it. i mean, it was national news. do you still work for nasa?
your honor, we find that homer simpson's soul is legally the property of marge simpson and not of the devil.
a few years back, bart was adopted by mr. burns. in this very special outtake, homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son. watch.
i suggest you leave immediately.
bart!
gotta change that answering machine tape! oh god, i gotta change that tape!
hello, muddah. hello, faddah. here i am, at camp granada...
homer, didn't you get any milk? all i see is egg nog.
bart, what's taking so long? if you're having that problem with your zipper, i can send your father up.
okay.
sure. we're gonna have a great day. ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right bart? bart? what's wrong, honey?
oh, homie. look at that watch. i've always wanted a watch like that.
i thought i told you: no returns for busted merchandise.
i always thought i understood my special little guy. but somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine.
hey, that's mom! she's happy again! you guys made a snowman family?
you can't hide from me in this house, bart! i spend 23 hours a day here!
does something smell funny in here?
those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
gee, business stinks tonight. where's barney, lenny, and carl?
awwww.
that i cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well. but who am i to complain?
okay, then, i just need your five hundred dollar registration fee.
no, i will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!
it's sick! and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. like mr. burns.
for what?
pop 'n fresh! you glutinous little doughboy! oh, there's something i've wanted to do to you for years.
oh, forget this. i am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that.
well, that's a funny-looking strike.
then back to my place where i will get you blotto...
uh-huh.
ooh.
who knocked down the pins?
good for him!
ahh... we forfeit.
ah, they think they're so high and mighty, just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants.
bart! where do you pick up words like that?
homer! watch your mouth!
they made us!
come on homer, come on homer / pretend this is baseball / and hit us a homer! way to go, homer! we win again! good job! etc.
listen here... i want to join your team.
yeah. call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old people are no good at everything.
so, who's ready to kick some christian keister?
i've always been wealthy , but this is the first time i ever felt rich.
now, homer, you were about to say something to me...
nice one, homer.
oh. i'm afraid i've had one of my trademark changes of heart. you see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. now, i must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. ta!
live from the famous brown sands of public beach, delaware, it's the grand nationals of sand castle building... preview!
that's right, dick. y'know, this year everyone's abuzz about one thing: the absence of mark rodkin. oh, wait, there he is.
why don't you read something?
well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?
"the dream police / they live inside of my bed / the dream police police / they come to me in my head / the dream police / they come to arrest me now / oh, noooo.... " howdy, neighbor! may i spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?
dad, it's right across the street from us! that fancy house'll never sell. nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
who are you talking to, homer?
i don't care who's consolidating their power. well, we don't need this.
who's "disco stu?"
hey, disco stu doesn't advertise.
king of the neighborhood!
i'll take that.
we surrender!...
wow, a former president, living right across the street!
actually this is one of the nine states where mr. bush claims residency, dad. i wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood.
that's really more of a weekend thing, ray.
sir, could you pop your hood?
homie. as long as you keep the car full of gas, i'm happy.
and that's why your no good kids are running wild!
okay is he expecting you?
you wanna step back, sir. you're trampling the flowers.
wimp, am i?... agent johnson, agent heintz, you men stand down. all right, mister. you want trouble, you're gonna get trouble.
then you're gonna get trouble.
oh, yeah. lots of trouble.
uh-unh, i'm not going outside today, not with those neighbors. staying right here 'til my speech to the elks club.
who is it?
boys? where you going?
looks like we're experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.
his house?
locusts. they'll drive him nuts.
hey, turkeys! behind ya!
i just drop by with present for warming of house. instead find you grappling with local oaf.
i'm sorry i spanked your boy, homer.
pleased to meet you. i just moved in. my name is jerry ford.
say, homer, do you like football?
well, why don't you come over and watch the game and we'll have nachos. and then some beer.
no, grampa, don't!
don't be a sap, dad. these are just crappy knock-offs.
listen, i'm not going to lie to you: those are all superior machines. but if you like to watch your tv -- and i mean really watch it -- you want: the carnivalé. it features: two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well, durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart...
bart, comb your hair. homer, i don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie.
if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?
name, please?
uh, you know, marge, your family doesn't have to stand in the alcove. they're free to enjoy the club.
yes. they're better. socially better. and if we fit in, we can be better too. so today, while the rest of you were out being different, i did a very good job of fitting in. so good that evelyn gave us a guest pass. they might even ask us to join!
you know, homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf is to lower your score.
i'm the club pro, tom kite. how 'bout i give you a few pointers on your game? now you don't want to over-think...
keep your head down.
homer, please. i have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow.
yeah. can ya bank it into the handicapped stall?
rant on, simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph.
oh, quit cogitating, steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! the sand wedge!
smithers, what are you doing up here?
there are no other balls. uh, just these, uh, reptile eggs! ooh, step away, they're endangered!
cheating for me? good lord, smithers, that's patently unnecessary. i'm one of the world's finest golfers! in all the years you've caddied for me, i've never lost a-- oh.
you know, homer, mr. burns holds a lot of sway at this club. if you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating, i'm sure he'd support your application for membership tonight.
we can't drive this up there. they'll see the dent. they'll see the coat hanger antenna. stop the car. we're walking.
i won't say anything controversial.
come here, maggie. oh, homie, i like your in-your-face humanity. i like the way lisa speaks her mind. i like bart's... i like bart. and i like my old green dress. i didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown.
don't worry, i saved the receipt. we'll have a $3,300 credit at chanel.
no, it's a standard clause.
fill out schedule b. you should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks.
you gotta hand it to krusty.
i can't believe krusty is really gone.
how about town crier? you'd be great at that.
yeah, dad! you're a big fat loudmouth. and you can walk when you have to.
thankily-dank, mayor, i shan't disappoint. har ye, har ye! i declare myself pickled tink about springfield's bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial day!
aw, they're just family heirlooms. that shouldn't stand in the way of homer takin' my job and--
toast.
what would you say if i told you jebediah springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? look. jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprüngfeld. his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight!
he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
he was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. he even tried to kill george washington!
you do?
that won't help, dad. no one's ever going to believe me.
we could?
oh, you're back. and you've brought a friend.
question: is your name ridley scott or james cameron?
well, then i will thank you to stop peering at my screenplay, "homer." and if i see a movie where computers threaten our personal liberties, i will know that you stole my idea.
he wouldn't let me put it up.
well, yes, but human decency prevents--
credibility.
i was so sure...
by the power vested in me, i hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell--
oh, dad, i'm really sorry. i know how much you wanted to be in the parade.
welcome to an evening of exciting quarter mile action ! our first race is a benefit for daredevil lance murdock , who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver !
yah. now i realize caring for mr. burns seems like a big job, but actually it's just 2800 small jobs.
your new duties will include answering mr. burns' phone, preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting with his chewing and swallowing, lying to congress, and some light typing. montgomery burns' office... oh, hello mrs. burns... i'll see if your son is available.
uh-huh... okay, i'll give him the message. mr. burns can't stand talking to his mother. he never forgave her for having that affair with president taft.
well, the van's leaving. which one duty is giving you the most trouble?
sorry, can't hear you. bye-bye!
good lord, smithers! you look atrocious. i thought i told you to take a vacation.
ah, yes, simpson. i'll have my lunch now. a single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg.
homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. "little rascals" isn't on 'til 6.
eh? what about my options?
simpson? simpson? did you get that report on the accounting department?
is it about my cube?
now get cracking on my long division. and don't forget to show your work, simpson.
kids, stop exploiting your father. homie, why don't you lie down and relax.
the telephone has been ringing for some time. answer it.
is there something wrong, homie?
what happened, dad?
no, please! i can't bear another thrashing. just leave me be.
praise god, i think the thug has finally gone home for the day. now i can make my escape...
uh... no! i'm... uh... making it myself! hear that? the percolations are imminent! no need to come in! cease your ingress! stay back, homer! approach no further. coffee's already made. i stomped the beans myself.
ah, and my dear, dear smithers... you're no longer needed at all. you're fired. ta!
cheer up, homie.
i look forward to working with you!
mr. burns may have mastered 2,799 of my 2,800 duties. but i'll wager dollars to donuts he still can't handle a call from his mother.
ahoy-hoy? hoy?
mrs. burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more desiccated. and she doesn't call her son mr. burns!
impersonate my mother, will you? and you, smithers! you must have put him up to it! i'm glad i fired you.
stop fighting like a girl, simpson.
what did you get that for?
did he die?
bye, mom. bye, dad.
i won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. homer, you go, too.
the mouse.
mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. and dad's upstairs.
hey dad, can i have $1,000?
to pay for a lawyer for my bum.
i've got it! dad, give me $750!
well, first off, here's your $1,000 back for hiring that lawyer. and $750 for the drawing. and here's a couple of bucks for your trouble.
dad, can we have $183,000?
lisa and i want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
that's not a leather muppet, that's troy mcclure. oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!
what are you talking about?
hey, homer, isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with troy mcclure?
this play has everything!
remember when we were kids, we used to dream about our ideal husbands? who knew the dream would come true for one of us? oh, come on. guess which one.
it was a beautiful wedding. i've never seen selma happier.
what?!! oh, my god!
no, thanks. do you have any fruit?
well, what if we used our imaginations...? houston, we have a problem. homer 13 is spinning out of control! i'm going after him!
hello?... oh, homie, hello! i can't remember the last time you called me from -- oh, you want to speak to lisa?
i'm learning about owls.
security guards?
why do you need me?
zagnut bar, mr. smithers? razzles? skittles? whatchamacallit? twizzlers?
we could have a slumber party.
okay. time for truth or dare. you go first.
okay... why don't you...
hmmm... truth.
da-ad!
dad, you tell everybody everything. even moe knew when i threw up on the dentist.
nobody does! he's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. but that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
whee.
there's something troubling me, dad...but i don't think i can tell you because it's a secret.
langdon alger? oh, i don't like him anymore... okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially bart.
no, no! then he'll know i told! dad, you said i could trust you.
it's in tennessee, right next to the oak ridge nuclear facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb.
...and bart could be the courier!
uh, springfield, my computer shows your t-437 is fully operational. uh, i suggest you... oh my god! oh, god, no! oh! this can't be happening! this... you're operating without a t-437, springfield!! oh, sweet mother of mercy! i mean... i mean... my god!...
...and then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. why is he always making up those crazy stories?
no! old people deserve our respect! look at jacques cousteau and goldie hawn. you wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
lemme in! someone's trying to kill me! sweet merciful mcgillicuddy, ya gotta open the door!
but where are we going to put him?
on a treasure hunt.
only if you're ready to stare danger in the face, put your manhood to the ultimate test, and take--
well, things were bad everywhere.
well, now realistically, homer, i've lived here some 30-odd years. this is the first and only bear i've ever seen.
i phoned ahead.
that's specious reasoning, dad.
by your logic, i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.
it doesn't work.
but i don't see any tigers around here, do you?
actually, dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history.
that's the home-owner tax.
i don't see how you can support proposition 24, dad.
no. in truth, an illegal immigrant, sir. if proposition 24 passes, i shall be forced to leave this country. oh, i wish... oh, i wish i could have stayed just one more year or two. there was so much i wanted to see and to do and to have done to me.
ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. they want all the benefits of livin' in springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language.
hey there, homer, how's it hangin'?
oh, you're just noticing the way i'm talking to you now. you see, it turns out i am an american citizen after all. apparently, i just plumb forgot about it. say, let's take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. the ny mets are my favorite squadron.
i cannot deny my roots and i can not keep up this charade. i only did it because i love this land, where i have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever i want. i want to stay, but as the real me -- not as some yahoo from green bay.
oh, homer. are you rounding up immigrants?
that's nice, although three of you are below voting age.
oh no. that is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of american history.
because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date. the library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after new mexico became a state but before arizona did.
...executive, legislative, and, uh, judicial.
please, mr. simpson, my brain needs sleep. the test is in six hours, and many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me.
dude, karma.
no, i mean--
he's right! / you said it, homer! / etc.
"dear parents. due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. by reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."
dad?
uh, mr. simpson, sir? can you please change the radio station?
dad, please. you're embarrassing us.
dad! no one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! you have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!
oldies.
wicked!
sandra, that was mean.
it's called rocking out.
i used to be "with it." but then they changed what "it" was. now what i'm with isn't "it," and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me. it'll happen to you.
dad, you forgot to pick up milhouse!
what are you talking about? 
this is an authentic hullabalooza ticket. for authentic refreshment, eat clark bars. and for totally outrageous class rings, it's josten's. gooooo, josten's!
people, have your tickets out. throw your cameras out. surrender all identification.
it smells like otto's jacket.
dad, you cannot wear that! that's a rastafarian hat!
wearing a jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
you know what, dad? maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while.
don't commit your hate crimes here. hate crime!
dad, are you okay?
so you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
of course you have a choice.
and now, get ready for the man...with the iron stomach!
hey, cannonball -- i like your statement: when life takes a cheap shot at you, you stand your ground. billy corgan, smashing pumpkins.
dear bart and lisa...
i don't even know anymore.
hey -- i wasn't a weirdo. i was in the audio visual club.
alright, homer! / etc.
gee. i don't like the sound of that.
my god. those cannonballs have practically demolished your stomach. from now on, no cannonballs, no spicy foods, and when you lie in a hammock, please -- rest your beer on your head or your genitals.
so what's it like being famous, dad?
dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?
what religion are you?
just some report i gotta do for school. hey, you want some pie?
you're the coolest dad alive!
homer, i'm sorry. there's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied freak, unless that's his act. i expect your letter of resignation on my desk.
i mean the hood of my car.
dad, what you just said was powerfully un-cool.
well, how the hell do you be cool? i feel like we've tried everything here.
homer, i'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. i was all set to go off on vacation, when i get called up for jury duty. oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums. now they're trying it as a maritime offense. so anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? free of charge.
well, if it'll seal the deal, i'll take a look at your septic tank. see if i can get her hummin' again.
maybe you're getting stronger.
that was thoughtful.
put food in me.
full speed ahead. prepare to dive! dive! 
because it was the only one in the house. come on, homer, open the door for your mystery date!
how come lisa doesn't have to play? why does she get to hang out with her friends?
my apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks is prohibited in this state and is punishable by-- follow me. any red-blooded, flag-fearing american would love the m-320. celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it.
fresh out.
this is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know.
what's up there? / is it a monster? / we have to know! / what's the secret?
three! we have three kids, homer!
so i have two brothers?
a routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. it was then i knew the only option was to separate you two immediately. you'll both need to sign these. but what to do with poor hugo? too crazy for boys town, too much of a boy for crazy town, the child was an outcast. so we did the only humane thing.
we've got to find hugo.
i'll start with radio shack.
hello.
this is a mission of conquest. take us to your leader.
president clin-ton. excellent.
commence bio-duplication.
that's slick willie for you. always with the smooth talk.
sure you were, rummy.
well, a refreshingly frank response there from senator bob dole.
my fellow americans: as a young boy, i dreamed of being a baseball. but tonight i say we must move forward, not backward... upward, not forward... and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!
i am looking forward to an orderly election tomorrow, which will eliminate the need for a violent bloodbath.
ow! i don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet i never even heard of.
you took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
we have roots here, homer. we have friends and family and library cards... bart's lawyer is here.
homer, i don't want to leave springfield. i've dug myself into a happy little rut here and i'm not about to hoist myself out of it.
cypress creek. a tale of one city...
homer! you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
your dreams may vary from those of globex corporation, its subsidiaries, and shareholders.
even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage.
uh... homer... ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the tv trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in cypress creek?
oh... uh...
haw-haw.
i am here to welcome you on behalf of the president of the globex corporation, me. try the papayas. they're juicy and full of papayine. makes you strong. like popeye. popeye, papayine. popeye, papayine. see, same thing? same... ah, forget it. how are ya? i'm hank scorpio.
don't call me that word. i don't like things that elevate me above the other people. i'm just like you. aw sure, i come later in the day, i get paid a lot more and i take longer vacations. but i don't like the word "boss". hey, look at my feet.
you like those moccasins? look in your closet -- there's a pair for you. don't like 'em? then neither do i! get the hell outta here! ha! ever see a guy say good-bye to a shoe?
we don't have bums in our town, marge. and if we did, they wouldn't rush; they'd be allowed to go at their own pace. now, if you'll excuse me, i'm in the middle of a fun run. see you at work tomorrow! although i don't really like to call it "work"!
relax, homer. at globex, we don't believe in walls. matter of fact, i didn't even give you my coat.
having a place like this has always been my dream, homer. what's your dream?
don't do that. my butt is for sitting, not for kissing. now you tell me the truth -- what's your real dream? your real dream?
i bet people laughed at you when you told them that dream.
now homer, these gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears and, should the need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body. your job will be to manage and motivate them. give them the benefit of your years of experience.
the key to motivation is trust. lemme show you what i mean. i want you to close your eyes and fall backwards and i'll catch you. that's gonna show you what trust is all about. ready?
3... 2.... one second... hello?
yes? what happened?... when did that happen?... how much of it?... oh, my goodness, i'll be right up! homer, i've got to go upstairs, there's a problem. somebody ate part of my lunch. i'm gonna leave everything to you. we're on a tight schedule; you keep them motivated.
sure thing, boss.
sports collectibles! wow, a baseball made out of secretariat!
why don't you buy it?
i'm sorry, we're just a little tired, sir. we've been pushing ourselves real hard to get the reactor on-line.
hammocks? my goodness, what an idea. why didn't i think of that? hammocks! homer, there are four places: there's the "hammock hut"; that's on third...
there's "hammocks-r-us"...
that's on third, too. you got "put your butt there"...
that's on third.
that might... matter of fact, they're all in the same complex. it's the hammock complex, down on third?
uh, homer. one second. i gotta take care of this. very important. 'be right back.
collapsed on its own -- you schm... you have 72 hours. see ya. back to the hammocks, my friend.
you know, there's a little place called "mary ann's hammocks". the nice thing about that place is mary ann gets in the hammock with you. i'm just kiddin'.
that's something for you to do. find that out.
hi, homer! i'm keeping two of my fingers crossed that you're gonna have that nuclear generator up to full power by tomorrow.
good. by the way, homer, what's your least favorite country, italy or france?
nobody ever says italy.
sugar? sure. here you go. sorry it's not in packages. want some cream?
i don't expect anything from you, except to die and be a very cheap funeral. you're gonna die now. stop him! he's supposed to die!
nice work, homer. am i prouda you!
i've been so bored since we moved here, i've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. i know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but i just can't drink that much.
t minus 1 minute 35 seconds.
aw, gee, homer, could it wait a sec, please?
i'm having a little trouble with the government.
what's the problem?
well, you can't argue with the little things. it's the little things that make up life. homer, i'm disappointed, but i think you need to do what's best for your family.
telegram.
i think owning the denver broncos is pretty good.
well explain to me why it isn't.
no, i don't.
homer, please, you're hurting my arm!
night vision goggles? a bathroom scale from a soviet sub? a suede briefcase-case? oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems...
some bullies beat me up and took it.
this is for the crummy life i've had to live!
fun's over, fellas. if you're gonna beat up my friend in my bar, there's a two-drink minimum. jeez, homer, i never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- i mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down.
there ya go! that's the spirit! homer, i seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you! y'know, boxing might be right up your alley!
aw, please, it's the good life, homer. some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!
well, i dunno, are you man enough to test every one of your limits?
and are you man enough to throw a punch, should the opportunity arise?
and are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?
i'll take it!!
yeah, well, when i realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979, i turned it into an office.
yep. they called me "kid gorgeous." later on, it was "kid presentable." then "kid gruesome." and finally, "kid moe."
aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. yeah, i been meanin' to empty that out.
yeah, he was my manager. back when i was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. but somehow i just never made it to the big time.
homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. you're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. before you even consider this, i insist you consult a doctor.
you have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as "homer simpson's syndrome."
all right, homer, let's see the left. oooo-kay... let's see the right.
when you're ready...
who's gonna knock you down?
when are you gonna fight back?
what are you gonna do?
okay. you're fighting a guy named boxcar bob.
i gotta be honest with ya, homer. i didn't bring you up here to show you my new tar-paper.
no. homer, how would you like to be heavyweight champion of the world?
great. all you gotta do is fight drederick tatum. it's this saturday. here's your parking pass.
uh, you know what? i'm gonna have to check on that...
have you lost your mind?!
but you'll get killed!
mom's right, dad. the odds against you winning are a thousand to one.
those are the odds they're giving in vegas.
due to popular demand, we will forgo our national anthem. and now, ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rum-ble!!!
it looks like it's all over. tatum wants to finish this with one punch. and here it comes... oh, my god! simpson's manager has flown into the ring and is airlifting him out! ladies and gentlemen, whatever dignity remained in boxing is literally flying out the window!
yes, homer, i'm an angel. all us angels wear farah slacks.
oh, homie, are you okay?
well, what do dreams matter, marge? i was able to stick up for a pal. well, so long, springfield...
i feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the world series!
well, if god didn't make little green apples -- it's homer simpson! how long have you been here?
i can honestly say that was the most fun i've ever had. the mill, the history, all that gorgeous foliage. i can't excape lisa, our little walking libary!
no! what if he's crazy?
we're not picking him up!
there's not enough room!
i just don't think it's a good idea.
hey, relax. i don't wanna work. i'm so lazy, i took lessons on the player piano.
lazy? you're not kidding. i'm like a rug on valium, i'm talkin' lazy.
i think we heard enough about larry burns for one evening.
oh, "yakkety-yak-yak"... you, foodbag -- do you have a son?
i'll tell you what's with me -- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish, ignoramus for a son!
what's the matter, pop? don't you love me anymore? sheesh, dad and i, we started out great, but now it's fallin' apart, like a chinese motorcycle.
yeah. i tell ya, i don't get no regard, no regard at all. no esteem, either.
yeah, right. i dunno, maybe i should just leave town.
and what's that hitchhiker doing here? is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
ahoy-hoy?
yes! i'm missing one son! return it immediately!
oh, how much proof do you need? five thousand? six thousand? i swear, that's all i've got.
can't we just go upstairs?
kidnapped?!
you know how i feel about hoaxes!
i want you to take larry back to mr. burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble.
drive faster, grandma! grandma's gaining on us!
shhhhh! some people are trying to watch the movie!
with pleasure, sir.
and where is all that liquor coming from?
we interrupt this cartoon for a special report.
oh, all right, we'll go. now, the cat needs his medication every morning --
and the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--
woo hoo!
shall we say ten?
dad, do i have to brush my teeth?
dad, i think i need some fresh air. can i go to the park?
no.
i'm not going to press charges, but i assume you'll want to punish him.
well, if you won't discipline him, i'll come back and speak with his mother.
she makes me taste beer.
it's eleven o'clock. do you know where your children are?
oh, i agree. kids need rules and boundaries.
it's so tough to be a parent these days, what with all the gangs and the drugs...
that's true, but i was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there.
homer, i'm as permissive as the next parent. i mean, just yesterday, i let todd buy some red hots with a cartoon devil on the box. but you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!
what were you thinking, sending bart to such an awful place?
dad, we can't let this happen to belle! do something!
please hurry.
stop! no!
all right, dad, you've been warned. let's go.
c'mon...
is it really necessary to watch tv while we're eating? we're getting food all over.
hello marge. how's the family? i don't want to talk about it. mind your own business.
well, i pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. i pictured napkins... homer, i want to throw a dinner party.
hey lis -- check this out. non-stick coating. oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?
well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
oh, good. that will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham. homer?!
huh. i should have asked them to hurl some bacon, then maybe i coulda had a decent breakfast for once.
you wanna talk? go ahead, luann, talk! why don't you tell 'em one of your little bedtime stories, huh? like the one about how rotten it is to be married to a loser; or how about the one about how i carry a change-purse? yeah, a purse!
okay, kirk, i'll tell a story. it's about a man whose father-in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory...
a man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial impotence...
oh, okay. ta-ta, i'm off to the beauty salon.
i feel terrible. the van houtens split up at our party.
i shouldn't have served those north korean fortune cookies. they were so insulting: "you are a coward." no one likes to hear that after a nice meal.
uh, singles life is great, homer. i can do whatever i want. today i drank a beer in the bathroom.
uh, just throw it over the fence. let arby's worry about it. that's jerry. he's a major player down at the sewing store.
homer, get ready!
remember? luann and chase are taking us out to hear spalding gray.
you said you'd do it as a favor to me.
okay. starla's a temp at k-zug radio 530. she's going to help me launch my singing career. my car! oh! my demo tape!
go ahead, homer. laugh at me.
you know why all this happened, don't you? 'cause i took my marriage for granted. y'know, in twelve years, i never once helped out with the housework.
i could've at least stayed in shape for her.
god, i was so self-centered. no wonder i didn't see it coming. that's how it is, though: one day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day you're thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink.
oh, how do you know? what makes you guys so special?
hi, dad. you know, there's buns in the cabinet.
oh, okay. can i stay up?
you mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
she knows.
you're very lucky to have mom.
homie, i appreciate this, but i'd really like to get some sleep.
none! they would have more sense than that.
only three cavities, bart. your best check-up ever. i'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken.
why? am i pregnant?
oh, homie. i know you love me. we don't need to get married again.
dearly beloved --
i will now read the special vows which homer has prepared for this occasion. do you marge take homer, in richness and in poorness?... poorness is underlined... in impotence and in potence? in quiet solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered monkey-navigated -- and it goes on like this.
good morning. one donut with sprinkles, and... wait a minute -- these are not sprinkles, sir!
you have clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them on top of the donut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles!
huh? oh, that's an auto-dialer. this bird was using it to pull a telemarketing scam, but instead he's gonna rot in the slammer for the next twenty years -- bread and water, icy showers, guards whompin' your ass 'round the clock, and the only way out is suicide.
an automatic dialer? is that legal? i don't want you getting arrested, homer...
or swindling our neighbors.
hmm. one dollar for eternal happiness... mmmm, i'd be happier with the dollar.
why it's the at-5000 autodialer, my very first patent! aw, wouldja listen to the gibberish they've got you saying! it's sad and alarming. you were designed to alert schoolchildren about snow days and such. well, let's get you home to frinky. hope your wheels still work.
that is it, ned! if you don't unplug that phone right now, you're sleeping on the lawn!
lisa! the cops are chasing me. i need a place to hide!
ned, did you plug that phone back in?!
hmm, pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent, increasing wind... here we are, chapter two: "so your pressure is dropping." -- dad, wake up!
i think a hurricane is coming!
well, need some help there? you know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker. oh, it'll be fun. we're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. make sure we don't owe anything extra.
no, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--
why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
it's dying down!
dad, no! this may just be the eye of the hurricane.
wait. listen, everybody! the hurricane's over.
y'know, it's kinda funny. the only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. they're all we have left.
glad to do it. / sure. / happy to help out. / etc.
uh-huh. ooh, looks like a loose nail.
well, i've seen about enough.
the man who lived next door until his house blew down.
we want to teach ned to release his anger in healthy doses. we need someone so irritating that ned simply will not be able to repress his rage. homer, can you be that annoying?
mmm. he's not responding. proceed to level two antagonism.
ah, he's still repressing. maximum hostility factor.
hi, neighbor!
um, did you like it?
mmm, mmm. 'sure are fun to scratch. mmm. satisfying.
oh, they hum like angels. you're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light.
well, i just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco.
no, homie, wait!
okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off. but i want you to promise me you won't have any beer.
ooh, look at that adorable spice rack! eight spices! oh, some must be doubles. "or-uh-gahn-o?" what the hell...?
they say he carved it himself, from a bigger spoon.
um-hm.
woo-woo!
that simpson, he thinks he's the pope of chilitown. well, this year i am ready for him!
you promised you wouldn't drink!
wait, mister! you're drinking a candle! you don't wanna get wax in your mouth, do you?
his ears if we're lucky!
let him go, ralph. he knows what he's doing. 
fear not, homer. i am your spirit guide.
there is a lesson you must learn.
no, i speak of a deeper wisdom. the problem, homer, is that the mind is always chattering away, with a thousand thoughts at once.
clarity is the path to inner peace.
sorry. i am a coyote...
good. your mind is in a state of readiness. so listen well: to make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate.
your kindred spirit. the one with whom you share an unspoken bond... a profound, mystical understanding.
is it?
hi, homer. find your soul mate.
so then i says to mabel, i says...
i'll finish this later. hi, dad.
so anyway, i says to mabel, i says...
don't "soul mate" me!
okay, but i'm not your soul mate. i'm really more of a chum.
find your soul mate, homer. find your soul mate.
either that or batman has really let himself go.
oh, homer, thank goodness you're safe!
i woke up and you weren't there, and i was so worried...
well, i was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. and i was sure you'd head west, because springfield slopes down that way. and then i saw the lighthouse, and i remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron...
yeah.
...and you're from mars.
homer, don't you see? our differences are only skin-deep...
...a profound mystical understanding?
space coyote?
we did it!
but homer, it's ten in the morning.
another duff, homer?
uh, sure, sure. uh, here you go. düff. from sweden.
just a second, homer, you gotta take a breathalyzer test before i let you drive home.
oh, son, i'm glad to see ya. i went for the morning paper and i got lost, and...
aww.
don't be afraid.
have you been drinking?
maybe you just dreamed it.
dad, according to "junior skeptic magazine" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours.
i am the thing from uranus!
good doggy. good doggy!
well, your story is very compelling, mr. jackass... i mean, uh, simpson. so i'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter.
yo!
now we're going to run a few tests. this is a simple lie-detector. i'll ask you a few yes-or-no questions and you just answer truthfully. do you understand?
mr. simpson, it's a felony to lie to the fbi.
i don't believe you, homer.
you're not listening. you're only hearing what you want to hear.
homer, please! i try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. please just let it be.
no, i'm not.
hey, dad. what's the word from planet crackpot?
well, actually, dad... i believe you.
yes, i do. you seem so damn sure.
what if we don't?
they'll buy anything!
yo, dad, can i have a sip of your beer?
and that is how much college will cost for maggie!
i bring you peace.
oh yes we do! i got it all on tape.
yes, is the alien carbon-based or silicon-based?
is the alien santa claus?
surprise me!
these shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! and look at the fine stitching on "dope!"
well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. i'm proud of you, homie.
...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
well, that's the miracle of the franchise. you get all the equipment and know-how you need, plus a familiar brand name people trust. you'll be on a rocket ride to the moon. and while you're there, would you pick up some of that nice green moon money for me, royce mccutcheon.
did you know that disco record sales were up 400% for the year ending 1976? if these trends continue, aaaayyyyyy...
don't forget fat people. they can't stop eating!
here? our plant?
oh, cheer up, mom. you can't buy publicity like that. thousands and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring whitey ford.
of course. right this way.
hello? uh, no, pretzel wagon's no longer -- three hundred pretzels?! wait, wait, let me get this down. mmm... mmm... meatpackers union hall... batavia, new york... i'll send them right out! homer, homie, wake up! wake up, i'm back in business!
here you go, homer.
greetings, homer.
uh, uh, yes. i am. thank you for asking. now homer, as you no doubt recall, you were done a favor by our, uh... how shall i say, mafia crime syndicate. now, the time has come for you to do us a favor.
homer, did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?
oh, it just sickens me. how could you do this to someone you love?
we're going to do what we do every day. we're going to make pretzels. there, that's the last one. 
i'm afraid i must insist. you see, my wife, she has been most vocal on the subject of the pretzel monies: "where's the money?," "when are you going to get the money?," "why aren't you getting the money now?," and so on. so please, the money.
homie, maybe we should go inside.
alright, popcorn's ready!
yes, you won all right. you won more than you bargained for.
no, you take that back!
teamwork is overrated.
sharing is a bunch of bull too. and helping others. and what's all this crap i've been hearing about tolerance?
each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain. the routes are treacherous, so use your maps.
now as an added incentive, the second to last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious "world's worst employee" trophy.
and the last team to arrive will be fired.
i've placed all your names in this hat--
neither would i. i've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days about so-called "cheating".
mmm-hmm. if you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an american to do it. why should the race always be to the swift or the jumble to the quick-witted? should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts god gave them? well, i say, cheating is the gift man gives himself.
excellent. and to do so, i propose we travel by... horseless sleigh.
yes, well, i'm older than you. you know, simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met.
well, i don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early, homie old boy. more champagne?
oh, yes, but i'd trade it all for a little more.
oh, yes, sitting. the great leveler. from the mightiest pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?
yes, yes! that's it! oh, i could go for one of those right now! the only hard part is getting up.
sir, i am in your debt.
hope that wasn't an avalanche. be a chum and have a look-see.
isn't there any way out of here?
simpson, i have a confession. i'm not quite the tunnel digger i made myself out to be.
we... should... be... careful... not... to... speak... unless... it's... absolutely... positively... necessary.
let's go. those last three avalanches were your fault, simpson.
we must be covered by a thousand feet of snow.
hmmm... no books, no radio, no board games. ah! a bazooka joe comic. ech! i heard that one 75 years ago.
ah. 206 bones... fifty miles of small intestine... full, pouting lips. why, this fellow is less a snowman than a god. well, we've managed to stave off cabin fever for a few hours. i... i think we should dress the snowmen.
look at them. smug and secure in their finery. mocking us.
ah, snowmen have peepers. peepers to watch. to watch for our moment of weakness and then baff! comes the knock on the head and we're down.
i'll kill you, you bloated museum of treachery.
we'll be dashed to pieces.
oh, something's wrong with its brakes! gangway!
well, simpson, i must say, once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.
no.
all right... but don't be shocked.
homie, i'm losing my hair.
i was just with dr. hibbert. he said i was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
a nanny?!
but he didn't do anything!
homie, please, i never ask for much, but this is something i really need.
pleased to meet you.
homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one.
thanks. hey, where do you keep the liquor?
teach us songs and magic tricks.
the nanny we want is kindly and sage.
whoo! hello. i'm shary bobbins.
lord and lady huffington of sussex.
no.
i make you read every article in that magazine, including norman mailer's latest claptrap about his waning libido.
my, she seems too good to be true.
ooooh.
can i be a boozehound?
oh, thank you.
the secret ingredient is blood.
welcome back to "before they were famous." we all know rainier wolfcastle as the star of the blockbuster "mcbain" movies. but here's his first appearance -- in a commercial in his native austria.
well you know, homer -- if there's a job that must be done / you'll find it's much more fun.
searching for my lost shaker of salt... oh, here it is.
but haven't i taught you people anything?
they're not perfect, but the lord says love thy neighbor --
do you think we'll ever see her again?
'morning, roy!
you should try out, dad. you have a funny voice.
well, here. say something.
now that's just bad. you got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and i don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. next.
that's it! that's the poochie attitude!! do that again!
then you don't get the job. next!
okay, homer. let's get a level check on your voice.
relax, homer, you'll do fine. i'm june bellamy. i do the voices of itchy and scratchy.
she's a lady, all right. a beauuutiful lady.
oh, just experience, i suppose. i started out as road runner -- "meep!"
uh, excuse me, mr. simpson. on the itchy and scratchy cd-rom, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?
can somebody tell me what the hell is goin' on? midge, help me out here.
eh, that stunk!
yeah, you should be very proud, homer. you, uh... you got a beautiful home here.
right on, mr. s.!
are you prepared to die, poochie?
oh, cut! cut! cut! cut! just stick to the script as written, homer. you're supposed to say "please, cut off my head, i don't deserve to live."
hi, poochie! you look like you've got something to say. do you?
no refunds! force majeure! read the back of your ticket!
i'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear.
hey, lis, check it out! pogo stilts! these were banned in all 50 states!
oh, you should see the crossword puzzle! she thought that "mindy" lived with "mark!"
it's camp! the tragically ludicrous? the ludicrously tragic?
well, sort of... but i mean more like inflatable furniture or "last supper" tv trays or even this bowling shirt. can you believe someone gave this to goodwill?
boy howdy!
well, if you're inviting me over --
oh!...
dad! dad! company! company!
oof! homer, you are the living end!
mmm, i don't think he's married, homer.
he prefers the company of men!
homer, listen carefully: john is a ho-mo--
you're being ridiculous.
i'm very sorry you feel that way. because john invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going.
homer, at least come out and say hello.
come on. you liked john this morning.
oh, geez louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. john's a witty, urbane person.
hey, dad, look what i got! zzzapp!! zzzapp! zzzapp! zzzapp!
so if you wore a hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?
homer, i don't think there's a problem with bart. but if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. goodnight.
i don't, but i loved hearing it!
homer, john brought us cactus candy!
homer, what have you got against gays?
oh, homer, please. you're embarrassing yourself.
queer?
what are you talking about, homer? where are we going?
i'unno. i kinda want a cigarette.
anything slim!
roscoe.
why the hell would i want to see that?
dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?
oh, be nice.
oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. and their mtv's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. you gotta do it yourself, homer. and you gotta do it fast.
hey, he's right, homer. after the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!
but, dad, it's barbaric! how does killing a deer make you more of a man?
uh-oh, something's gonna die!
i know this much: i wouldn't wear that hideous hat. here, take this one -- it was worn by yale summers in "daktari."
oh, yeah, let a twinkle-toes drive betsy. right.
hey, those ain't your rats, barn. well, homer, you ready to call it quits?
c'mon, don't take it so hard, homer. you still got that other kid... uh, lisa. let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man.
...aw, geez, homer! geez! you and marge ain't cousins, are ya?
huh? you did? wait, man, those are reindeer.
aw, criminy! here come the waterworks.
dad, i'm scared.
no, don't! you have to protect yourself!
dad, are you hurt?
whoa, it's santa, all right! and he is kickin' ass!
oh, homie, i'm so glad you're safe! hmmm, you feel softer than before.
great! well, homer, i won your respect, and all i had to do was save your life. now if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set.
ho-mer.
we're very proud of you, by the way.
but he's safely locked away!
for life!
which is impossible!
madam, your children are no more!... than a pair of ill-bred troublemakers.
especially lisa. but especially bart. if he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, i can't be held responsible for my actions.
oh, that sounds fabulous, homer. stores throw the best parties.
you didn't remember that. you just saw it on tv.
well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but i have to drive to capital city, fill out some forms to get 'em out. could you possibly watch the kids tonight?
please, please, please!
hey, dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?
why you wearing it now?
dad, help me out!
uh, i don't think we should be driving here. the mayor's yelling at us.
oh, it's so beautiful! this is what i imagine paris must be like!
i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. i guess this makes us "yuppies," huh, homie?
isn't that clever? it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building.
oh, i do. i'm just a little concerned about the kids. maybe i should call.
and she is on drugs!!!
i'm going down to moe's for a coupla beers.
but what's the solution? are we so bereft of ideas that we must revive the antiquated notion of prohibition? channel six says yes.
dateline: springfield. with prohibition back in force, sobriety's peaceful slumber was shattered by its noisy neighbor: the speakeasy!
hey, hi, can i arrest any of you people for anything?
aw, geez. i don't have anything to do anymore. with banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town. and so am i.
whoa, bonanza! let's load it up before the rats regroup.
dad! knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
what happened to you, homer? and what have you done to the car?
i don't think it had broken axles before.
why do you have so many bowling balls?
beer!
you're the one the papers have been talking about. that mysterious "beer baron" who's been supplying springfield with alcohol! how have you been getting away with this?
homer, that's very clever!
you're out there somewhere, beer baron. and i'll find you.
yes, i will.
dateline: springfield. the elusive beer baron continued to thumb his nose at authorities. swaggering about in a garish new hat, he seemed to say: "look at me, rex banner. i have a new hat."
uh, dad...
homer! my customers are soberin' up, and they ain't gonna stay for the ambiance! you gotta get me more beer!
look, find it, buy it, make it, i don't care. just get me some booze, and fast!
you know, they're fifty for $3000 today.
now you're making your own alcohol? that's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
one of the stills --
homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. your homemade liquor is exploding again.
you've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. why not quit now, while you're ahead?
stick 'em up.
yeah, i had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. c'mon, give me the dough. i can throw this pretty hard.
poor wiggum.
um, who?
oh, yeah... more than anything in the world!
yeah? what's that?
that was a very sweet thing you did for poor wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?
...and he who shall violate this law, shall be punished by catapult.
release the prisoner! on behalf of the city, i'd like to apologize, and ask how long it will take for you to flood this town with booze again.
three and a half. we get beat up, but we get an explanation.
oh, my goodness.
homer, bart's up there!
did you check your pocket?
homer, this is yours.
gas your termites... "freeze your termites"... "zap your termites"... "save the termites"... hel-lo. "dear occupant: because of your fine credit history, you have been pre-approved for a moneybank charge card..." hoo, baby! okay, lessee now... "occupation?" hmm, butt doctor. "income?" whatever i finds, i keeps! "name?" hmm, name, name.... my name is... santa's little helper.
and for homer --
and so handsome! bart, i just love him!
what've you got for me, boy? hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat.
"some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."
oh, it's against the house rule... oh, i guess just this once.
homer, are you wearing a tie to impress laddie?
well, we wrecked the first dog. we've got to treat this one right. bart, why don't you take laddie for another walk.
hey, that is one fine-looking animal you've got there.
ha, ha. hey, this fellow's not available to stud, is he?
nah, that's not too likely. but still... you're gone. oh, where are you, boy? time for a walk. again? we gotta find out where he's keeping these.
no. he just wasn't the right dog for me. i'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.
we can't. he's not in a kennel. i gave him away, too, and i don't know where he is.
i'm sorry, i know it's wrong. i messed everything up and now i don't have any dogs at all.
i don't want a new dog. i want santa's little helper.
the bad dog.
mom, mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!
i could still use more paper.
dad! you're not supposed to have fun recycling. this is serious.
you found a candy bar?
they're not going to close the plant, are they?
dad, if you just drink one more, i'll have a full bag. there's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
thanks, dad!
ah, the baby who shot me. no, i was referring to your other daughter.
nothing evil. that's exactly the kind of radical thinking i need! it's a deal.
and from our "it's funny when it happens to them" file... remember millionaire c. montgomery burns? the man who blocked out our sun, ran over a local boy, and stole christmas from 1981 to 1985? well, guess who's flat broke and picking up trash for a living?
wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking.
lisa, nobody likes a gloater. right, homie?
oh, i can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! i was a fool to help that horrible old man!
simpson, what are you doing here? why aren't you at work?
oh my goodness. kids! homer! we're late for church! i'm glad i dressed last night.
...and the very same goes for ezekiel, which brings us back to our starting point, the nine tenets of constancy.
hey, calm down. you're wrinkling your church clothes!
the dump?
no, no, i don't feel like going to a trash pile today.
i don't know... guilt?
well, i think volunteering is great. deep down it makes you feel -- homer! will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? it came from the dump.
hai! hai! hai! bye. hai!
yes. you have very lucky dishes, mr. simpson. this soap is from the sacred forest of hokkaido. renowned for its countless soap factories.
is it a local call?
moshi-moshi?
hello chief. let's talk why not?
oh, you like mr. sparkle?
it's a videotape!
bor-ing.
yep. there's your answer, fish bulb.
we are home.
play dead!
...baboons to the left of me, baboons to the right, the speeding locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs. a pair of the great apes rose up at me, but biff! bam! i sent them flying like two hairy footballs. a third came screaming at me and that's when i got mad...
any office supply company can have them made up for you.
yes, sir.
there's a new guy at the plant. uh, maybe we oughta say "hi" to him.
how do you do.
oh, yeah. carl and i each have a masters. 'course old homer, he didn't need a degree. he just showed up the day they opened the plant.
um... yeah... well, listen, i'm... sure we all have a lot of work to do.
my name is grimes, uh, simpson. frank grimes. i took the trouble to learn your name. the least you can do is learn mine.
you're eating my special dietetic lunch.
the bag was clearly marked. please be more careful in the future.
i'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, simpson.
you idiot! you nearly drank a beaker full of sulfuric acid!
who did this to my wall?
come with me.
but, sir, if i could...
ah, it's a weird world, homer. as hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither.
okay, gimme that. gimme it back!
well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. turn him from an enemy into a friend. then when he's not expecting it, bam! the old fork in the eye.
okay.
calm down, homer. calm down. answer the door.
yeah. what did you want to see me about, simpson? this better be important.
hello.
hi.
yeah, but look at the size of this place. i-i-i live in a single room, above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley.
i... i'm sorry, isn't that...?
you. went into outer space. you.
no! i wouldn't gaw, i've had to work hard every day of my life. and what do i have to show for it? this briefcase, and this haircut. and what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?
homer... homer, why aren't you at work?
you're afraid to go to work because frank grimes will be there, aren't you?
you'll have to face him sometime. and when you do, i'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.
he doesn't hate you. he just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
oh, here we go.
i wouldn't bother him, honey. he's making some kind of model for a contest. he says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand.
pipe down!
oh, i can't stand it any longer! this whole plant is insane! insane, i tell you! i can be lazy, too! look at me! hi! i'm a worthless employee just like homer simpson! give me a promotion! oooh, i eat like a slob but nobody minds! i'm peeing on the seat. give me a raise?! now i'm returning to work without washing my hands. but it doesn't matter, because i'm homer simpson! i don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. d'oh d'oh d'oh!
frank grimes, or "grimy" as he liked to be called, taught us that a man can triumph over adversity. and even though frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short, i'm sure he's looking down...
well, golly, i'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. you haven't seen him, have you? caucasian male, between the ages of six and ten, thinning hair?
then prove it. i want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.
son, it's me! i floated up toward heaven, but got lost along the way!
here he is!
ghost? what ghost?
you know homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show.
yes! and it might look something like this...
inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?
christian love?
well, if you won't think of society's ills...
well, it's time to say "good night."
i know, i'll go to my room and think about what i did.
you know, you do have options. for example, there are behavior modifying drugs. how wedded are you to the bart you know?
military school?! you lied to me!
freak-outs?
ouch! ow. ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
they're just children, mr. simpson.
please don't make me stay, dad! i'll do anything you say! i'll find religion! i'll be good sometimes!
no!
well, he's got more confidence!
a medal? thank you, sir! for satisfactory completion of the second grade.
what a day. / let's get started. / some serious drinkin'. /
noooooooooo!
all i remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at villanova. or maybe it was a streetcorner.
homer, i don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself.
dad, you got a letter from the city of new york!
"dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of manhattan..."
why not?
yeah! that's what people do in russia!
great! we're all going to new york!
dad, our baby pictures were in there!
homer! homer, those legs belong to the man behind you.
homer, you're scaring the children.
the bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. we'll meet you in central park at five o'clock.
fresh khlav kalash! get your khlav kalash!
no bowl -- stick. stick.
mountain dew or crab juice.
only khlav kalash. men's room in tower -- tower! observation deck.
yeah, ya jackass!
my god, that maniac is heading straight for us! go secretariat! go!
hey, it's dad! right on time!
we're not jumping, homer.
what a magical city! can we come back next year, dad?
i have no son!
not if you called 'em "stench blossoms".
i'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine's day. i'd rather have candy.
to capitol city.
i came up with the idea.
because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies.
because we couldn't find grampa to sit for them.
and i'm not seymour! my name is armin! this is armin's apartment! armin's liquor! armin's copy of "swank"! armin's frozen peas!
well, i don't see any way out of this.
but i'm a hero!
well this is a lovely gesture, but we still have to face the fact that i'm not really seymour skinner.
movies john travolta made...
whoever you are, just pass it along, kid.
but dad, i'm supposed to practice an hour a day!
you'll practice me? what does that mean? is it supposed to be some sort of threat?
oh yeah?
dad, you don't understand. this saxophone is like my oldest friend. i've had it for as long as i can remember.
nuh-uh.
oh, honey, i can't right now. bart's gonna be late!
homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. if a strange man offers you a ride, i say take it!
for no reason here's apu -- those were the dayyyyys.
very nice.
homer, i can't get the baby to burp. could you try for a while?
homer!
that's damn fine coffee you got here in twin peaks. and damn good cherry pie.
homer, i want you to look at this drawing bart did.
homer stop! would you please look at the drawing?
i think we're going to have to get bart some help.
two apples!
that's wonderful! but still, can't you do anything for bart?
that's right, honey. if you nurture her gift now, there's no telling what she can do.
lisa simpson has won the nobel prize.
i can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality. over seventy-five per cent of our graduates go on to first grade.
very good. once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition check, she's in.
our fee is non-negotiable.
sorry. i don't have anything to offer you unless you're a member of a minority group.
and sometimes i feel so smothered by this family i just want to scream till my lungs explode! uh... i'll go start dinner now.
hello!
and so, springfield's heat wave continues with today's temperature exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of molten lava.
homer, have you seen the frozen peas? uhh... you keep 'em. now listen. if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage lisa. umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the museum on saturday...
well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner.
i cannot believe this. i'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
balzac!
but balzac is the name--
uh... homer?
well, sir, i hate to be a suspicious aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?
i'm lisa!
that one!
wow. so that's how lisa got her sax.
you know, homer... i think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?
don't forget the smell!
why don't you make me?
he's blind as a bat! 
...and that's how an heroic hippo became a deputy.
this just in: tensions continue to mount between springfield and france over mayor quimby's now famous "frog's legs" joke. the french president has threatened swift and massive retaliation if he doesn't receive an immediate apology.
homer, you know how unpredictable the french are. one minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. what if they start a war?
i won't.
i know it's good.
i'm happy for you.
not everyone died in the blast, homer. some of us were merely horribly mutated.
come on, we just wanna eat your skin!
homie, is that you?
all the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.
friends with mutants, right.
i take it from that little impressed noise that you are interested in purchasing that matter transporter, sir.
sold! but i must warn you, this device carries a frighteningly high risk of catastrophic...
hey dad, can i use the transporter sometime? please, i swear i'll be careful.
ow! someone just punched me in the face!
bluggh? blarrr! blagh!
oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. i'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time. homer, stop that!
good one, dad.
there's one thing i still don't understand. when bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?
blarrgh!
mom, dad, help! he's trying to kill me!
you just made a big mistake, fly boy. hey! it worked!
homer, what are you doing?
let us throw open the floor to, ah, wild accusations.
as for the rest of you...
yar... and that's the story of the very first caramel cod. i mean, halloween. and it wasn't long before this yearly custom became an annual tradition.
dad, that's our house.
you'll see all your favorite soccer stars like: ariaga! ariaga ii! bariaga! aruglia! and pizzoza!
and they'll all be signin' autographs.
can we go, dad? / please dad? / please, please, please? / can we go, huh, huh please? /
pelé is king of the soccer field. to be king of your kitchen, use crestfield wax paper.
jobbers cobknots ya mucker!
oh my god, homer! they're right next door!
looks like you called me ju-uust in time. this home isn't secure at all.
well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks good but doesn't provide any real protection.
and you can have it all for just five hundred dollars.
but surely you can't put a price on your family's lives.
homer, we need something to protect this family.
whoa, careful there, annie oakley.
bandoleer...
silencer...
loudener...
speed-cocker...
sorry, the law requires a five day waiting period. we've got to run a background check.
yeah, well, you don't.
dad! it's three a.m.! can't you mutter in your room?
all right. go ahead.
frequent problems with alcohol...
you beat up president bush.
relax, that just limits you to three handguns or less.
homer, i don't want guns in my house! don't you remember when maggie shot mr. burns?
no! no one's using this gun. the tv said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder.
dad! the 2nd amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. it has no meaning today.
no...
i'm sorry, homer. no weapons.
assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately, but they're manufactured for a reason: to take out today's modern super-animals, such as the flying squirrel and the electric eel.
hi, homer.
homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts.
oh, don't shoot. just take the money and get out.
missed one, dad.
uhmm...
homer, i told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table.
it's the same table!
i'm a lucky woman.
bart!
you lied to me! you promised to get rid of this gun!
how could you?! of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable...
and that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns.
homer! you use your gun as a can opener?
are you some kind of moron?
i'll also need to remove your tattoo.
vote quimby.
down here, homer.
come down here.
what about the gun?
homer! you said you got rid of the gun. you lied to me! again!
yoink!
yo, give me the bullets.
no, i don't think so.
i'm comfortable with who i am.
in this reporter's opinion it's time for our lard-laden lads to shape up. get out and try fun activities like military service...frenetic dancing... or good old-fashioned pee wee football!
yeah, but i could get seriously hurt.
the wildcats!
you know, homer, it's very easy to criticize.
ooo, he's quite a little dancer.
yayyy! / i'm special! / wooo! / etc.
sir, if i could just break in for a moment...
what?
what?! what is it?!
dad, that was really mean.
do you have a problem with the way i'm coaching?
i don't want to make the team.
are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
good morning, everybody.
what did i do?
you shouldn't pressure bart like that.
you're gonna blow it! that's what i get for having faith in ya.
bart didn't get cut. what a surprise...
but, coach?
but i can't play quarterback. i don't even know how.
since when?
good luck, homer. no hard feelin's.
ready. set. hut, hut! yahh!
are you kidding? i reeked!
dad, i've got some bad news.
no, i got hit by a couple of cars. i won't be able to play today.
great!
yeah, he does. / and how.
you don't get it, do you? i don't want to be your stupid quarterback! i quit!
may i be excused, mom?
homer, please.
ahoy-hoy-hoy?
homer, mr. burns can't see you winking.
we drove 2000 miles for this?
aw, i don't wanna bother mom at work.
such a product does not exist, sir. i think you must have dreamed it.
this thing only takes dollars.
but i thought uter took my place.
time for one last play, coach.
it's okay dad, i can fill in for nelson.
poor bart... you know we had a lot of fun tonight, but there's nothing funny about... vapor lock. it's the third most common cause of car stallings. so please, take care of your car and get it checked. i'm joe namath. goodnight.
lazy bums.
"this is just a note to say, i think about you every day. and when i get you all alone..." well, it gets a little bit personal, here.
oh, here's one from my mother.
no, no. it is the sign that it is time for my arranged marriage!
no, no, no. don't you know what it means?
it all happened shortly after my eighth birthday...
no, no, no, no, you do not know mother. she will never quit until i am married.
no, no. i cannot lie to my mother.
yes, that is right, mother. i already got married... why did not i bother to tell you? well, uh, the reason is... well, i guess i... i didn't-think-you'd-understand. oh, got-to-go. bye-bye-bye. i love-you. love-you. it worked! it worked! the lie has set me free!!
i am sorry, you do not have enough for both.
it is my mother! oh, no! oh, no! what am i going to do?!
bu... don't you see?! she is here to meet my wife. the wife that i told her i had. i do not have a wife.
oh, she's going to be here any second! oh, yes, that'll buy me some time. homer, you've got to help me!
what?! what?! what?! what?! what?!
what?!
how was your day, sweetheart?
ohhhh. here i am!
ah, sorry homer, i've been planning this vacation for years. i'm finally gonna see easter island.
abraham simpson. cornelius talmadge.
all right, folks, it's supper time.
supper time!
oh, yes i do.
another bag of chips, mr. talmadge?
a respirator. it breathes for him.
you mean there?
well, i'm glad you were having fun, because i've had my hands full with apu's mother.
yeah, shut up.
oh, would you shut up.
to marge!
well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left...
can you believe it? tradition forbids me even to speak to the woman i am about to spend my life with. hmf, has the whole world gone crazy?
your old friend apu is a lamb being led to the slaughter.
oof, i am really doomed. only the gods could stop this wedding now.
dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant.
but we didn't enter any police raffle.
i don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
all right, uh, simpson, homer. you're next.
ha, i hope you brought your checkbook, wise guy.
why would a motorboat have a mast?
hey, they can't just build a parking lot on saber tooth meadow. that's where they discovered all those fossils!
what is it? / what? / that's unbelievable. / oh, this is nice. / wow.
lisa's right! it's an angel!
what are you doing with that?
it's probably a million years old, dad. i think it's as valuable as it's gonna get.
coming up next... an hilarious "boat giveaway" scam nets springfield's dumbest criminals!
hey-hey there, marge. just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you.
c'mon, homer. i just want a quick look-see. pay ya a buck...
dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. there's no proof of that.
what about that sign right there?
just let me take it to the museum for one day. they can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
good. stay there.
hey, she's gonna smash the angel!
it's gone...
i could take up smoking.
hardly. anyone could have written that.
uhm, nah.
it's wednesday, homer.
is this all we're going to do today?
we have to make the most of the time we have.
otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives.
friends of the library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.
ooo... oo! there's an azalea festival at the public garden!
i don't want a drug boat.
sold!
you bought a car?! without consulting me?!
i found this hat!
stop, homer! stop it! let me out!
i'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
geez, this hot-rod is souped up six ways from sunday. never had you figured for a gear-head, homer.
what is that? a six-barrel hollye carb?
meyerhof lifters...
i made that last one up.
selling real estate could be just what i'm looking for. i'd really like to give it a try.
they back your baaaannk!
you didn't do anything.
ah! dad! doesn't this car have seat belts?
wow! / your own billboard! / check it out!
works for the lumber king.
that's what debbie sue said...
ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. big deal.
well, i can too compete. and i'm going to sell a house. end of story.
ho-ho. okay. baldy boy hits wire, head comes off, li'l bandit rolls to a gentle stop. everybody wins.
uh, now that you mention it, we could use...
so long! / good-bye! / good luck!
gimme my car, fatty.
come on... let's hear that snap! ow!
ow!
ow!
aw! whoa! this is sooo dangerous.
uh, marge? still got that deposit check?
why do you always wait until christmas eve to do your shopping? the crowds are just beastly.
homer! look at this mob! the good toys are probably all gone.
out?! but i just --
what happened?
what? you can't rule it out.
hey, why don't we walk over to grampa's and cheer up the old folks? that'll make us feel better.
looks like the flanders are having a nice christmas.
merry christmas, simpsons!
homer, look! your house is on tv!
nah, he's right, homer.
no. my husband is... at church.
yeah, she's quite a gal.
does anyone have change for a button?
hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours.
hey, speak for yourself.
it is now. and because of your loss, folks, i'll throw in the undercoating for two hundred -- nooo, four hundred and ninety bucks.
slow down, homer.
no, away from the skid! hit the brakes! / floor it! / stop! / to the left! / head back!
that was close.
why you little...
kent brockman here for a follow-up with springfield's favorite hard luck family, the simpsons! folks, any words for the christmas thief, if he's watching?
little lisa's sweater? little homer's sausage?! what in the name of holy hell is going on here?
so the family never knew about any of this.
ha.
i know you're used to getting hate mail, but i'm not.
if you're headin' for the medicine cabinet, i already been there.
yeah. plus lots of other stuff.
hey, that's my washcloth.
she's going around the other side. now get her!
we got the popcorn! did you get "waiting to exhale?"
did you get "emma?" did you get "emma?" did ya? did ya? did ya? huh?
what did you get?
they're gonna paint that wagon / they're gonna paint it good / they ain't braggin' / they're gonna coat that wood.
yeah, their guns are right there!
i thought it was toe-tappin' fun.
homer, you sing all the time!
wake up dad / you're singing a song!
it's a desperate criminal / on the run from the law / please spare my children!
a singing family! it's worse than i feared / for hostage purposes / you're just too weird. / bye!
i'm back, so resume wetting your pants.
say your prayers and then it's ka-blammo! uh-oh, i'll be back when i get some ammo. / bye!
we can't even get any local laws passed / without everyone singing like a big broadway cast.
done, done.
come onnn. you have to go outside to do your... business.
sure we do. ding ding ding ding ding. ding ding ding ding ding...
well, well, well... looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --
oh boy! / all right, free money! / wow!
you can't go on that. you have a heart condition.
none taken.
okay, let's go, fatty.
see any pigeons yet dad?
how 'bout you, lucky!
oh, listen pal, i gotta son of my own. here.
not so fast, pardner. you owe me some money.
at the carnival? cool!
i don't know... you gonna get drunk and start a lot of trouble?
well, in that case, let me show you how i scammed you. have a seat. spud, throw a couple more apples in the caramel. aw, now don't worry. that's just to scare off thieves.
ah, there you are. you two ready to work?
so what's our first job, huh? test the roller coaster?
ohh, this isn't fun... maybe if you didn't go to the bathroom so much, you wouldn't be so small.
yeah, dad?
does it matter?
dad, we're saved!
ya see, the trick here is, the rings won't fit over the good prizes.
good move.
lookie, lookie, hey, hey, wocka, wocka! i got rings and you want 'em! win a genuine ronex watch. just like a real moogie star!
we're natural born carnies, dad. if only we weren't tied down with a family...
ah, i hate to interrupt your fun, boys... but i got a few complaints that your game is crooked.
um, hey, dad, i, i think he wants a...
uh, let me put it this way. i'm looking for my friend "bill." have you seen any "bills" around here?
listen carefully and watch me wink as i speak. okay?
the guy i'm really looking for, wink, is mr. "bribe," wink, wink.
oh, good lord. our whole life was in that trailer. what are we gonna do now?
did-ja call me, spud? 
i'm goin' for a corn dog. you want one?
how long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
what's going on?
they're squatting in our house?
well, well, look who's here. mr. no bribe. sure, we'll help ya. just sit down and wait for detective like-i-give-a-damn.
that urkle's a hoot.
homer!!
no fires!
there must be a way to outsmart them.
yeah, i'm listenin'.
oh, i can't watch.
way to go, dad. you actually outwitted someone.
homer...
thanks for lettin' me skip school to see the team come back from the championship, dad.
do unto others as you would have them do unto you!
a new and better life awaits you on our distant home planet, blisstonia.
we're having a free get-acquainted session at our resort this weekend.
it's free.
um, it's free.
it's this weekend.
c'mon, dad! the team's arriving!
but what if they try to talk us into something?
watch yourself, dad. you're the highly suggestible type.
welcome, brother!
hi, how are y--
it certainly is a beautiful day. we should thank the leader.
beer is not allowed.
would you rather have beer or complete and utter contentment?
the leader knows how miserable you, marge, lisa, bart and maggie are.
just come up and watch our orientation film. you're free to leave at anytime.
the leader is perfect!
what are you talking about? there's nothing like that in there.
but our point is very simple. you see when --
yeah, lose some weight! / amen you're fat / moron-type
it doesn't wear down your resistance if you eat a whole month's supply. he even ate mine!
or... na na na na na na na na leader / na na na na na na na na leader....
you what?!
you what?!
i can't go along with this, homer.
dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?
homer!
oh, yes you are. i'm afraid it's our home now. this house will become the new local welcome center for this district.
yeah, maybe it'll wear off. like his interest in c.b. radio.
the leader! / he's coming! / the leader is coming! / the leader! / etc.
we toil in the fields and he rides around in a rolls royce?
oh, look who the new pet is!
yaaay! here comes the leader!
all right, now, what's so all-fired great about your fancy-pants leader?
eww, well, that is impressive.
uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? anyone like a draft beer?
he's our husband now.
hallelujah!
homer simpson! because of your lack of faith, you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation!
whoa, cool! god is so in-your-face.
aw, those poor badgers are soaked.
oh my goodness! that was a long movie! it's time for school! let's go! let's go!
oops! that's for me. flancrest enterprises is my home business.
no-ho-ho, it's true! maude and i sell religious hook rugs over the internet.
yep.
homer, what are you doing?
what business enterprise?
internet, eh?
what exactly is it your company does again?
how about compuglobal hypermeganet?
i'm interested in upgrading my 28.8 kilobaud internet connection to a 1.5-megabit fiber-optic t1 line. will you be able to provide an ip router that's compatible with my token-ring ethernet lan configuration?
homer, bill gates is here.
don't let the haircut fool you. i'm exceedingly wealthy.
your internet ad was brought to my attention. but i can't figure out what, if anything, compuglobal hypermeganet does. so rather than risk competing with you, i've decided simply to buy you out.
homer, quiet. you'll queer the deal.
well, everyone always does. "buy him out," boys!
look, homer. there's that bird you like to argue with.
hey, if you didn't wanna tie shoes, you shouldn't a become a shoe salesman.
excuse me, sir? do you like to laugh?
well, then you'll love our comedy festival. it's for a good cause.
i finally got around to reading the dictionary. turns out the zebra did it.
dad, the zebra didn't do it. it's just a word at the end of the dictionary.
it's just a joke.
plus, i got this new boyfriend. and you know how it is when you're kissing a guy with a tongue stud...
thank you. thank you. and now, the all new comedy stylings of... krrrusty the clown...
i see. uhh... what about 2 cent stamps?... pizza pie's very hot these days, uh... can't open pickle jars, no mail on sunday... out of paper towels... oh! oh! oh! what's the deal with cardboard?...
me too...
four drink minimum?
yeah! / right on, krusty! / you tell 'em!
it's my allowance, mother, and i'll burn it the way i want.
dad!
oh, knock it off, homer. you're the fattest one in the car...
oooo! / what did you do? /
ow! bart, that has nuts in it!
yeah, mom says a lot of things.
actually, we can't take a bath anyway. the water heater is broken.
yeah. big deal. you got a wife. i got a rash. who cares? ech, i'm sorry, homer. it's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman.
ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a micronesian swamp.
yeah, i don't blame her. no girl wants to end up with a joe puke-pail like me.
yeah, well, uh, how come i ain't fendin' off movie starlets with a pointy stick?
it's all yours.
no, i'm in love with you.
i like a face with character.
who cares? you're goin' out with me. she's going out with me, cat!
but he's really grown on me. he's got this insecure, sweaty charm.
shut up, or i'll ram a stool down your throat! ah, nah, nah, no, i don't want that on the card... well, lemme hear how it sounds... nah, nah, take it out. take it out. and charge it to my players club card... maxed out? look, i really need these flowers, okay? i got a real tenuous hold on my girlfriend here... hello? hello? well, that's it. it's all over. renee ain't gonna wanna hang around with no joe pinchpenny.
hmmm... i need cash, and lots of it. um, all right, everybody, i'm calling in your bar tabs. ya bunch of ungrateful ingrates! ya-- ah, homer, what am i gonna do? renee's my last chance for true love.
nah, my car ain't worth nothin'. but it is insured... for five grand... homer, i need your help. you gotta steal this car and wreck it for me.
homer, i insist you steal that car.
okay, here's the plan. this model car represents my car, huh? and this olive is you. now...
hey! hey! aw, that's great. now the car's gonna have to represent you, and, uh, this little toy man will represent the car. all right, forget it! listen up, here. tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you "steal" my car.
that's the beauty part. every cop in town's gonna be on the police department's moonlight charity cruise. and i'm gonna be right there with 'em.
why all the black?
you look a little nervous, dad.
you're up to something, aren't you?
get off me, mr. president!
dad, we're the visitors.
i'd like to believe you...
well, dad, in the meantime, here's a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff.
three.
yeah, congratulations, homer. the plan worked perfectly.
yeah, yeah, that's, that's a kick in the pants.
yeah, i wish i could, homer, but if i change my story, they're gonna throw me in here.
ohh, cripes, the puppy-dog look. all right, all right. i'll use the money to bail you out.
hawaii, here we come! "i nanakuli makou 'ai ana o na uluwahi hawaii!"
hey! stop saying hawaii in there!
would you care for some reading material?
homer! thank god, you gotta help me here!
oh, homer, i been the world's biggest rat. can you ever forgive me?
aww! ah, my poor bar. it's all gone.
kids, from now on, i don't want you touching anything in our house. dart!
more comin'.
to pass the time, please enjoy this novelty pen.
look at this mess! where is that elderly old man? old man? old ma...
wait a minute... there is a note!
hey, lis. wanna join us?
and now a channel 6 editorial reply...
whuh? 
i don't want to turn out that way!
lisa! come on! your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!
i'm supposed to talk to you about proposition 305...
beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. you can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower...
homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!
little girl -- likes her brain. what's your opinion?
oh, yeah.
uh, i shoot birds at the airport.
you probably should've researched this first, eh, dad?
my legs hurt.
wait a minute, homer! you didn't ask everybody. what about the women?
so i'm not doomed! oh dad, i've never been happier to be your daughter.
so, wait a minute. this means i'm gonna be a failure?
me. i smell a museum.
i wanna read the giant book!
help! she's touching my special area!
all right, all right, now. you're over-stimulated. let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed.
but people will see me paired up with a doofus. you have no idea what that's like.
ohh, i found something all right.
but asking you was ralph's idea.
as homer's defense attorney i feel we should be merciful-- hey! did you just take a bite out of me?
homer, wake up! it's time for our coffee break.
uh, sir, we've found the problem. some idiot threw this in the reactor core.
you did this? how could you be so irresponsible?
oh, really? why did you think you could lie to me?
next, on exploitation theater: "blackula," followed by "blackenstein." and the "blunch black of blotre blame."
are you thinking of joining the naval reserve?
eh, sort of.
just fill out this form and you're on your way to the reserve.
well, due to a recent presidential order, we're not allowed to ask that particular question.
la la la la la la la! i am not listening! la la la la la la la la!
homie, i really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. what if you get called into combat?
we don't have a clapper.
and although my religion strictly forbids military service -- what the hey, i'm in too.
hey, homer, bring me back a torpedo.
but flanders got his kids torpedoes.
homer!
tuck in that shirt -- shine those shoes, mister -- oh, for the love of --
um, all right. you like me, but i don't like you!
what are you, a comedian?
very nice, simpson. but next time tie the other end to the ship!
permission granted.
i'm so proud of you, homie.
hello everybody. sparkle sparkle.
milhouse jumped off a cliff? i'm there!
well, i'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me!
next weekend we're having our annual war games. now simpson, because of your many years as a nuclear technician we're putting you on a nuclear sub.
be careful, dad.
are you sure you'll be okay?
come on, dad. didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?
i like the cut of your jib.
homer! join us.
tell me, young man. what do you want out of life?
we all want peace. but it's always just out of reach.
exactly. not with the olive branch but the bayonet. ah simpson, you're like the son i never had.
i'll take care of it. oh, what the hell -- simpson, while i'm gone, you're in command.
homer, we've got an enemy sub closing in fast. what do we do?
fifteen seconds to collision. we need a decision!
we're losin' power! we're losing back-up power!
that means you're in charge, homer.
those were the orders.
sonar, out. navigation, out. radio, out.
captain, how are we supposed to get home with no equipment?
aye, aye, captain. setting course for rigel 7... i mean, home.
mayday! mayday! the engine room has sprung a leak! it's filling up with a clear, non-alcoholic liquid.
yeah, that's it. we've got a pinhole leak and there's no way to plug it!
dad, the earring could plug the hole.
you saved us, homer.
attention, homer simpson! you have ten seconds to explain your actions before we open fire!
i think you're off the hook.
i think you're a hero, dad.
then can i get a tattoo that says, "bite me?" you never know when it might come in handy.
a king cobra?
weapons-grade plutonium?
ninja death stars?
ten!... nine!... eight!... eight-eight-eight...
dad!
that was last year's taxes! you have to pay again this year!
homer, you know we don't have...
homer, i painted that for you.
what about you, homer?
homer simpson? united states government.
you're looking at five years, minimum.
you won't be seeing any prison movies where you're going... prison!
anything? well, that's a start. agent johnson, fbi.
from now on you're gonna work for us.
the government has no right to use you this way.
there you go, ratboy.
no, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression.
oh, god!
or that telemarketing scam you pulled?
oh, you, you mean like the time barney beat up george bush.
hey, how did they finger charlie? somebody musta ratted him out.
my superiors were pleased with your work. you have a flair for treachery.
let's take a walk.
good morning, agent johnson. the film you are about to see is top secret and contains adult situations. in 1945, the people of europe struggled to rebuild following the war.
to make good on this drunken boast, truman authorized the one-time printing of the largest denomination currency ever: a trillion-dollar bill.
sometimes i don't know why i bother.
employee, eh? what a pleasant surprise. hmm... a pack of vicious dogs should be ripping you to pieces...
very well, come on in. perhaps i have something i can scald you with. it'll, uh, be a few minutes. so, what brings you to my home?
ya! ha!
hmm. well, let me get you a towel.
oh, i get it. i'm on to you. you're from collier's magazine, aren't you? are you going to put me in star snoop?
i hope you don't mind a little walking. well, of course, i didn't want a racehorse in my living room, but you don't say no to spring byington, do you?
heh, heh, heh. heh, heh. ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit charlie chaplin was buried in.
here's a scoop for your readers: the hall of patriots. that intrepid lad is my great grandfather! franklin jefferson burns. tossing that tea without a care for what the caffeine would do to the fenway flounder.
let's move.
well, that would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it? i keep the real bill right here.
i'm not the thief, the government is. every year you make hard-working joes like my reporter friend here pay income taxes, and for what? aid to ungrateful foreigners, do-nothing nuclear missiles, tomb polish for some unknown soldier...
ohh, you can silence me, but you can't silence collier's magazine! tell the people! don't let the government push you around! you have a choice! fight back!
that really was more of a burgundy...
capital idea! let's blow this fascist popsicle stand. we'll purchase a small island somewhere and start our own country, free from the relentless tyranny of uncle sam.
attention fugitives. you are leaving u.s. jurisdiction. turn back immediately or we will be unable to prosecute you.
no, wait! we're now over international waters.
es carne de burro.
so, you say batista's gone? did you know that?
please, we are all amigos here.
well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then i'm guilty. and if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and hand it over to communist cuba, then i'm guilty of that, too. and if it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, i'll soon be guilty of that!
ah, they serve as seeing eyes for the blind, sir.
no.
ahh, may i inquire as to how you are "differently abled"?
uh, sir, helper monkeys are only for the physically challenged or enfeebled.
monkey! there's a monkey in the house!
why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
and now... "kids news."
hmf. the monkey's on my part of the sofa.
you already have a monkey.
hmm. it really makes you think.
i want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.
come on, mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money.
it's the same basic bear, homey.
it's a "kisses-make-me-boogie-o-lantern." kiss it and make it boogie!
uh, maybe later.
uh, what a terrible waste!
i heard that! you know the rule.
what did you call us?
didn't you learn anything from love day?
oh lord! now what are we going to do? just let the trash pile up?
see you in hell, brussel sprouts.
easy, ned, don't breathe in. oooooh!
uh, listen homer, ah, hate to be a fussy freddy and all, but maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors...
three, two, one... go! go! go!
yeah dad, you're always telling me and bart to apologize.
i think you're startin' to crack.
no way.
oh homer, you didn't beat city hall! they picked up our trash because i wrote a letter of apology to the sanitation commissioner and signed your name. period.
yes.
here's your apology back, mr. simpson, and i'm sorry we couldn't work this out.
i'm not tryin' to scare you. i'm just tryin' to get my work done, here.
what cameras? why are you still here?
leave the bird alone!
look simpson, i've been elected by the voters of this city sixteen years in a row, so they must think i'm doing a damn good job.
no! nobody wants to hear the nonsensical ravings of a loud-mouthed malcontent!
hey, everybody, vote for my dad, homer simpson. if you don't he'll beat us.
yea, i know. it's a peace of mind issue you know?
whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! can i help you?
okay, camera two... uh, excuse me, this is a restricted area.
what the bloody hell?
ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, homer. you need to focus here. you gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there.
can't someone else do it? that's perfect!
yeah. now get out there and spread that message to the people!
whoa, whoa, hey, you didn't pay for the beer.
oh man, you got that right. / yeah. / i guess so. / it's so annoying in the morning/ yes. / uh-huh.
i'll say.
hey, yeah!
yeah! / someone else! / someone else! / yeah!
sorry i'm late, everyone. somebody tampered with my brakes.
oh, c'mon, people. this man has promised round the clock trash pick-up. that's impossible!
i can't believe what i'm hearing!
pops? i'm only two years older than you!
all right, fine. if you want an experienced public servant, vote for me. but if you wanna believe a bunch of crazy promises about garbage men cleaning your gutters and waxing your car -- then by all means, vote for this sleazy lunatic.
aren't you gonna buy it, dad?
if i hadn't already packed my letter opener, i'd give you such a stabbing...
friendship? you told people i lure children into my gingerbread house.
wow, dad, you're really working hard.
i'm really proud of you, homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?
simpson, you idiot, you spent your entire year's budget in a month. your department's broke.
how could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?
my men ain't workin' another minute till we get paid.
i'll have to say drugs, too.
good god, homer! you're turning our wonderful little town into america's trash-hole.
but dad, you can't cram garbage under springfield forever.
and all those opposed to horse-whipping homer simpson?
i can't believe it's come to this.
moving the whole town five miles down the road! it's crazy!
so we transplant the town. we're just gonna trash the new springfield, too.
anyway, it's time for the church picnic.
no they didn't. you just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
aw nuts!
nice to see you, homer.
but rod picked his dad. it's a matter of family honor.
okay, dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good...
no, wait. i have a plan. but i'll need your underpants.
get him!
oh, i don't think he can get up. let's egg him!
me? i'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
whatever you say, sweetie.
so what will it be, mr. simpson? your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies?
oh yes, that is a new item. no bar contains more applesauce.
excuse me. you're doing this station all backwards. let me show you how to do it like a man.
hey, hey, hey. that's enough. now step over to the abdominator and i will shout slogans at you. push! harder! go past the max! reach over the top! master your ass!
and your shirt!
i've got some!
whoaa...
my casserole is not filth. eat it.
now that's just non--
you know rainier wolfcastle?
my dad could do it! he eats fifty dollars' worth of power sauce bars a day.
hm. congratulations, sir.
you're gonna be the first man to climb the murderhorn.
sure, it was the winter of '28... the butter baby flapjack company sponsored me and a fella named mcallister. we were almost to the top, when we ran low on supplies. heroically, i gave him the last short stack. then, that glory hog took all the supplies and headed for the top alone. i fell 8,000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks. 'course folks were tougher in those days. i was jitterbuggin' that very night. but that skunk mcallister was never seen again.
and when he reaches the top, mr. simpson, here, will plant this power sauce flag as an eternal symbol of man's contempt for nature. wait -- is "contempt" the word i want here? homer, you're the world's greatest hero. do you owe it all to power sauce?
dad, wait. you're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?
uh, dad? shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher?
then technically, shouldn't you go back down the mountain and start all over?
are you crazy? you'll never make it.
homer, listen to me! turn back now!
oh, homie! you're alive!
all i see is a pole. maybe the flag fell off.
forget about it, homer. you made it to the top. you're the coolest dad ever.
'mornin' boys. can't stop to chat. time is money.
hey dad, wake up.
it's lisa. i just called to tell you how much i love you and can i take the bus to the museum?
ahm... i wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. she said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get bart to the emergency room.
well... if it would put your mind at ease, i could take a limousine. although that would cost two hundred dollars...
hmm. i guess i could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea.
oh, what, this thing? i got it down at the museum. it's what the ancient egyptians call a "souvenir."
alone?
that never, uhh, happened, did it, homer?
but--
well then, get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are.
excuse me, ma'am? uh, hello? somebody? anybody?
dad!
look out!
are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? i mean, a drawbridge did close on your head.
i should have known i wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but i really wanted to see that exhibit. i'll never take another stupid risk like that again!
what?
i guess...
dad, are you all right?
see the isis exhibit. but the museum's closed.
dad, i'm kind of scared.
okay... here goes.
ohmigosh! it's the mysterious orb of isis. archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means.
oh! we can't touch it, dad. it's behind a velvet rope! a velvet rope.
dad! you broke it! it's a music box! dad, we uncovered the secret!
it's so beautiful. and just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years. thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, dad.
dad, that's the old spice song.
do do do do-do / do do do do-do / do do do do do do do do.
and look as handsome as the day we were married.
you mean frank grimes?
well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic. ohhh, look, homie. our wedding cake.
look at this little plastic couple. mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future...
i'm going to bed.
good night, homie.
oh. oh, did you want me to...?
no, no, no, i have my part in this, too, um...
homie, you got your, your elbow in...
mmm.
well, we used to...
ooh! who's a good boy?
oh yes he is! yes he is!
oh, yeah. he's really special.
homer, don't look.
someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. we can get a new one.
when we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our saturdays? driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?
ooh. there's the turn!
if somebody's in here, you're in for some serious ass-forkin'. huh. well, maybe they're in the media room.
ohhh. my hero.
he put new electrical tape on the cushions.
can i come?
should we get started?
hm, something's not right. does this bed feel lumpy to you?
oh, my heart's beating like crazy.
y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on.
exactly. now there's nothing left out there but treasure.
hey, you're back. did you rock the casbah?
it's okay when you're in love. and married. to the sweetest guy in the world.
you don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?
oh, we drank so much that night.
heh, heh. yeah.
we're trapped!
who cares what it is? let's monoxide it.
all right, men, those nudies are here somewhere. fan out.
but think of the scandal.
clothes! we're saved!
you mean this thing?
dear lord, look at that blimp. he's hanging from a balloon.
kids, i want to explain about the stadium. y'see, sometimes moms and dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other.
so they need to explore new ways to express their love.
all those eyes, just leering and leering at us.
yes, sir! one kwik-e-dog, one bubble gum cigar, and the latest issue of "success" magazine.
yes, i just cleaned out the machine, sir, so the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease.
i'm so sorry, but i sold it all to the rendering plant.
oh yes. they use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby food...
homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight.
with cans of grease?
come on, bart. the bus is here.
it's the first day of school.
dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars.
but doesn't she get her money from you?
um, i don't know how much more school i can miss.
they only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... oh, and get this, mom, she drinks iced tea.
when you want grease, go to the source: good old krusty burger.
i was thinking more of the deep fryer.
can i help you, sir?
mom's gonna kill you.
my poor homie. couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
hey, dad, i've been thinking. what if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?
dad, he's not stupid.
don't worry. this is the score we've been dreamin' about. the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.
are you as excited as i am?
eek! -- i mean, ach! -- i mean, what are you doing here?
saints be praised! i'm from scotland! where do ye hail from?
no foolin'?! i'm from north kilt-town! do you know angus maccloud?
uh... guys? guys? the hose.
hey, luigi bringa you kids free pizza. why you have to maka da fun, huh?
doctors say the life expectancy of the average man is now seventy-six point two years.
sir, do you need a tow truck?
indubitably, old chum.
okay, but you've accomplished a lot. you've made me very happy.
hi, dad. how was work?
come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt. surprise!
there you are in outer space. that's pretty impressive.
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children.
your family has asked me to take time out from my busy schedule to invite you to a very speciallll...
it's true. i read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
top of the world, ma!
dad? what are you doin' here?
that's great, dad.
excuse me, are you a student at this school?
that doesn't sound like me. well, i suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant.
huh? oh... uh... oh, nuts. i forgot. all i can think of now is edison. i can't even remember where i work.
uh, james watt invented the steam engine.
well, you're not thomas edison.
whatever.
do us a favor. invent yourself some underpants.
i didn't tell you to quit your job.
oh?
homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer.
you've started smoking, dad?
yeah. he invented stuff, too.
booger.
homer! you can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
hm. i brought you a tuna sandwich. they say it's brain food. i guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are.
and these should give you the grounding you'll need in thermodynamics, hyper-mathematics, and of course microcalifragilistics.
possibleh. or you could take something that already exists and find a new use for it, like--
uh, well, well... i suppose that... would... qualify, uh...
i will buy ten of those right now.
turn it off, homer.
dad, women won't like being shot in the face.
you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?
no, bart. homer... all these inventions, they're...
they're not very...
i'm not saying you're a bad inventor. i'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. or accept them as gifts.
do you mind?
homer! / dad! / look out!
it could save lives!
hey, dad, heard you swearing. mind if i join in? crap. boobs. crap.
if edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this chart?
so?
but i thought you loved edison.
man, i can't wait to smash that chair.
ohh! / well, now that i'd like to see. / yes.
your electric hammer, maestro?
you mean the wild mood swings?
uh, i think that's in italy, dad.
...authorities say the phony pope can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth. in other news, thomas edison, the greatest inventor of all time...is apparently still inventing, despite the notable handicap of being dead.
i gotta admit, homer. you're taking this pretty well.
that's me!
yeah, lis. she is a smart, sophisticated woman. now let's hear more about that big, big reward.
cram it, ma'am.
uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?
while i deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?
he's up in his room. bart?
no, no. i'm pretty sure he's with milhouse.
what?
i think he's at nelson's!
mmm. what do you think he's doing up there?
drug lab?!
that never happened, dad.
hmm... it's starting to cool down. i'll bake another pie.
i see a neck!
man, those are some funky-lookin' birds.
you're a lizard.
dibs on the liver!
ooooh-woo! wow. if your fly weren't open, you'd look just like roger moore.
ooh. ooo-la-la simp-son. huh. what can i do for you and your new do?
snake? but you're dead.
... and the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. on a lighter note, a kwik-e-mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.
well, somebody's a grumpy gus. what's-- 
don't you get it? he swore he'd kill me too. i'm next!
dad?
nooo!
you've got to fight the hair, dad!
i love you too, dad. get off of me.
ow! that's my face, you idiot!
homer simpson, you're under arrest for the murders of moe szyslak and apu nahasa -- pasa -- uh, just moe, just moe.
well, we're leaving. and remember, no itchy and scratchy. i better take these batteries just to be sure.
look! dad, you gotta get us out of here! use the remote!
she's teething. look... her very first baby tooth.
oh, geez!
homer, do something! the ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!
we'll return with "how dracula got his groove back."
oh, lord. i was hoping this day would never come.
i guess i've been in denial. homer... kang is maggie's father.
okay, we're back. homer, how did it feel to learn your baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus?
well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier... because we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in a soundproof booth where he can't hear us.
suckers.
dad! wake up! wake up! wake up!
actually, keeping promises would make you a good father.
yes, we'll go to the darn lake! now go back to bed. it's four a.m.!
homer, your spine!
whooa!
tree!
this is such a secluded area. i wonder who lives in that house?
hey, here come the simpsons. n-now be careful, homer. there's a fella in the sand right in front of ya...
there you go. and i assume you've read the boat safety manual.
check.
secure.
ready.
she's down.
step on it, mom. dad's signaling that he wants to go higher.
it won't go any --
there goes my turn.
what the hell?!
thanks. listen, you think you could slide over a little?
i'm alec baldwin. could you get off me?
well...
are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital, mr. simpson? you had an awful lot of glass in you.
what we really like here is the privacy. most people don't even know where springfield is.
no more muffins.
yeah, i'm not sure we need an assistant, mr. simpson.
i suppose we could give it a try.
okay, what is it?
but you just read that card from the gersh agency.
we've been looking all over for you, dad. where did you land?
where'd you get that muffin?
right.
uh-huh.
mister simpson, these exotic items are suspiciously different from your usual order of beer and pork. what gives?
when you win one, you can take care of it however you want.
yeah, i'm lookin' for alec baldwin and kim basinger.
oh, that's just homer. he's a new friend of ours.
do i smell vodka... and wheat grass?
ooh, i'll have one of those, too. hey, can i crash here tonight?
oh, they don't come much bigger than that.
but that's not what p.e.t.a. stands--
homer, i'm feeling some sharp pains in my neck.
um, does anybody know where this came from?
i am not!
no, i didn't!
i did not!
yeah, homer, um, most movie scripts are 120 pages. this is only seventeen. annnd several of the pages are just drawings of the time machine.
oh, what? i suppose you've seen a bigger star?
come on, make with a name.
tell the people, homer. they have a right to know about the celebrity summer house.
what do you care? i'm telling you what you want to hear.
what?
my god. the lemonade. look at the lemonade!
somebody must have told them we live here.
homer, how could you?
anywhere but here.
homer, you haven't touched your food.
alec baldwin, wow. that is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. what was it like at their house?
i washed the dog today.
ankle? "foccacia"? what are you talking about?
don't blame us, dad. the celebrities are the ones who canned you.
i never get tired of that.
hey, it's alec baldwin's medic-alert bracelet.
i'm really looking forward to seeing homer again. he always has the most interesting odors.
what the -- ?
pull over, you maniac!
not well. but i'll give it a shot.
mr. simpson, do you have anything to say for yourself?
woo hoo!
worthless old geezers.
i'll say.
now you're dreaming.
of course. nuclear power.
really?
nuclear power.
i didn't quite get the point of it, dad. why would lenny want someone to saw his legs off?
didn't seem like anybody even read the script.
you're joining the screen actor's guild?
fat guy number three?
how should i know? it was your mother's job to name ya and love ya and such. i was mainly in it for the spanking.
you might as well. you already made up a phony film credit.
you lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
hmm... i know where we might find your missing moniker. it's a bit of a drive, but on the way we can have a nice father son chat.
is that... abe simpson? geez, man, we haven't seen you since woodstock.
oh, homer j., how do you keep your hair so rich and full?
homer j., will you teach us to make love?
aaanyway, i-i still think about her every time i walk by that mural she painted.
all right, we got what we came for, plus that stink rag to boot. now, let's hit the road. just lyin' around... never workin'... without a care in...
whuh?
now i know how dean rusk feels. g'night everybody!
dad, do you mind? your feet are really close to my potato.
you know, i really don't appreciate being called a narc. and that poncho is filthy! let me dry-clean it for you.
ew! help! oh, i've never seen anything like... my eyes have been soiled!
homer, for god sakes, put your poncho on!
my man! you've gone granola.
okay, time to get back to work.
we grow our own vegetables and process them right here. and we give half the profits to war orphans.
w-we're just trying to pay the bills, homer. i mean, we're still hippies at heart.
wait. don't you work for a nuclear power plant?
yeah, an old-time freak-out sounds tempting, homer. but we've got a big order to fill.
hey, we'll call it a business trip and write off the mileage.
thanks for the tip, homer.
weirdos!
uh, it's that pair of dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?
oh, please god, don't let them come in here.
that was fun. i don't know if we actually freaked anyone out, but --
our entire shipment is ruined!
there won't be any more freak-outs! you're not a hippie, and you never were!
ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?
aw, cheer up, dad. you make a great hippie.
and the soles of your feet are jet black.
w-what happened to our crops?
but there weren't enough vegetables left to fill that order.
homer, those were our "personal vegetables."
officer, please, we can explain...
forget the clubs. just shoot him.
i'm a doctor, not a gardener.
... and may we burn in painful and foul-smelling fire forever and ever. aaaaa-- mmmennnn...onite minister will be giving a guest sermon next sunday. go in peace. aaaa--
...men.
i feel guilty coming here every sunday and never actually buying anything.
candy warhol? xavier nougat?
oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress.
those are eight dollars a pound, sport.
dad! the fish!
ohh, you don't sound so good. we'd better get you some cold medicine.
oh, homie, you made breakfast.
ooh, so plump and juicy. he's gonna boil up nicely.
come on! chuck him in!
let's go! in the pot. in the pot.
he looks like an ordinary... ow! son of a--!
pardon me for asking, but where the hell's my stupid lobster?
oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. by the way, i oiled the hinge on your diary.
uh, i am sick of everyone being so proud of me!
and now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in educational disbursement: state comptroller atkins.
who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
hip hip--
hey, dad, that light says, "check engine."
oh, come on.
founded by prostitutes in 1849, and serviced by prostitute express riders who could bring in a fresh prostitute from st. joe in three days, bloodbath gulch quickly became known as a place where a trail hand could spend a month's pay in three minutes.
uh, yes, sir?
oh, well... no, you don't... but if you have any interest in history...
wow! have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?
you can get drunk when we get home.
let's forget this whole thing happened.
homer!
up yours! can i go to the bathroom before we leave?
there's a rest area. pull over.
can i go behind a tree?
please go back! you can make it my birthday present.
but i might explode.
uh, actually, his kidneys were fine yesterday when he had his annual checkup.
homer, with all due respect, this x-ray reveals a textbook kidney blow-out -- which would explain those loud pops you heard.
i'm amazed you're alive now.
well, you could give him a kidney.
besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you.
check it out, dad. i rented all your favorite gorilla movies. "gorilla squadron," "gorilla island vi,"...
can i fluff your pillow?
well, i gotta hand it to you, homer. you're really brave to go through with this operation.
oh, yeah. and, and even if you survive the operation --
whatever. the point is, with only one kidney, you won't be able to drink yourself stupid no more.
plus they'll put you on one of those organ donor sucker lists. everybody who wants an eyeball or a spine or a vestigial tail will be after you.
listen, i'm just gonna get right to the point, here. can i have your buttocks? i mean, if you die. they look pretty comfortable.
oh, homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it.
i love you, son.
well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel.
ohh, anything, sweetheart.
dr. martins to podiatry.
don't read it. just sign it.
it simply says you won't hold us responsible if you die as a result of gross negligence. it's a standard form.
i love you, son.
arr, what other ships have ye been on?
good enough. welcome aboard "the ship of lost souls".
arr, i've been meaning to paint over that. now come and meet the rest of the damned. did i mention they're lost souls?
ahh, another lost soul has joined our world-weary ensemble.
oh, don't listen to him. we exist all right.
we wander the seven seas, trying to forget.
come, stranger, join our circle of infamy. tell us your story of en-nui.
i stole this accordion from a blind monkey, but you... you disgust even me.
don't worry about old grampa. i'm goin' to a better place. shelbyville hospital! oh, who'm i kiddin'? i'm a goner.
oh, dear.
try not to move, dad. you swallowed a lot of motor oil.
grave nothin'! i never felt more alive! oh! boy, i shouldn'ta done that.
yes. you've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs.
dad, you're tickling me.
we'll return for the remainder of the conclusion after these messages.
remember, it's bi-mon-sci-fi-con. be there and be square!
that swarm of nerds is gonna kill him!
who are you?
i can't, homer. i twisted my ankle. you guys go on without me!
oh, my god. someone has to go back in for maggie!
i'll tell you who. him!
homer, i don't think you were listening to what he just--
as a bodyguard, your only loyalty is to your pro-tectee. not to your family. not to your country. not to moohamed.
shut your sass-hole, boy. these melons represent your pro-tectees. throughout this course, you will pro-tect your personal melon as if it was paying your salary.
well, your dive wasn't bad. but i just didn't believe your "nooo!" you gotta sell it. remember, your "nooo!" is what gets you your next job. now drop and gimme twenty. you ladies are without a doubt the most sorrowful clique at the dance -- not one of you fit to guard a russian rock band! however, your checks have cleared, so you all graduate. congratulations. and now, in honor of your achievement, here is the theme song from the hit motion picture, "the bodyguard." and i-i-i-e-e-i-i-i-e-e-i-i-i will always love yooouuu!... ha!
you know, i really don't care for that code name.
nah! i know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?
we just want to get a snack.
that's not the point. and another thing. i asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
shove off, puke-holes. get out of there! these stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies. heh. here's a couple of düffenbraus, on the house, of course.
that "change" was a bribe.
thank you, fat tony. however, in the future, i would prefer a nondescript briefcase to the sack with a dollar sign on it.
dad! what a nice surprise.
can i still drink it?
those wacky gangsters. what are you gonna do?
help! help!
but the gangsters will kill me.
all right! all right, i promise.
i am not so much disappointed as i am blinded with rage.
aren't you scared, dad? i mean, if i were fat tony, and god willing someday i will be, i'd just be stewing in my jail cell, gettin' madder and madder.
homer!
homer, i'm, uh, not sure it's wise to go out right now. i was thinking of a quiet evening at home with the, uh... wife.
no, no, i truly do want to stay home with the... wife.
nnyyeeeeeesss?
dear lord, please make tonight's production better than "othello" with peter marshall.
please, i am only here as a devotee of the lively arts. but i do have something for the mayor that perhaps you could deliver.
you moron! that's the kiss of death!
never mind that, just go patrol the perimeter. ah, au gratin potatoes, that's a quality side.
he looks awfully familiar.
you're all talk, hamill. you never even finished jedi school. show's over, mayor!
homer... use... the forrr...
the forks... use the forks...!
ohh... cheer up, homer. i think you made a great bodyguard.
absolutely.
oh, wait, here it is.
i'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.
dust!!!
we'd better stop and get the car washed.
hey, homer. car's kinda dirty.
you listen to your friends, but you never listen to me.
that's it.
five dollars, please.
senior citizen's discount.
... and once again, tithing is ten per cent off the top. that's gross income, not net. please people, don't force us to audit. now we're going to pass this around a second time. brother ned, if you'll do the honors.
well, that's not quite true--
well, i did, but--
well, yes.
no, no, and double-no! i haven't done any of those things, folks. you name it, i haven't done it!
never a dull moment, huh, homer?
here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, homer. but i, i was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun.
yeah, i, i guess i do.
how 'bout it, homer? will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?
so what about all this meat?
now it's marge's time to shine!
seems fair.
of course i... oh, my stars! i can't do that.
so, what happens next?
okay, homer. i'm ready to learn. what's the first lesson? just give me the topic sentence.
homer, they blew that up yesterday.
ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. i'd better call maude and tell her where i am.
oh, the lights, the noise, the letter x -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. i'm overstimulated! i gotta get out of this town!
if he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp.
and now, the indestructible lance murdock will jump his suicycle over an audience member. and he'll do it while attempting to open a locked safe on his head. any volunteers?
no, homer, no! i wanna do something exciting, but i can't just go from zero to thirty like that! i-i could be killed.
well, actually, there are several rockets mounted to the--
okay, he's cleared the ring of fire! past the ring of ice! over the dog doo stick! he's cracked the safe!
god homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. rumba! yea, i was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered.
aw, leave me out of this, homer. games of chance are strictly forbidden by deuteronomy seven--
oh, righty-o. one betting disk please.
aaand, fourteen black.
how do you do it, homer? how do you silence that little voice that says, "think"? oh no. i-i mean common sense.
you threw it out the...
more booze?
look at this place! we must have really painted the town last night. i have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and i don't remember a thing!
oh, i did it! i conquered my fears and i made up for a lot of lost livin'. and i owe it all to the homer simpson program.
well, it's about time you two woke up.
mm-hm, i'm workin' on that.
take a look at this.
and do you, homer, take this cocktail waitress you just met to be your lawfully wedded wife?
do you want to get married? married!
you two fellas are the nicest husbands we've ever had, and we're not giving you up without a fight.
ginger's my wife.
homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?
what are we gonna do, homer? my kids are gonna be traumatized! and then there's maude. and then there's maude!
yoohoo.
your behavior is.. is unconscionable!
i want fatty.
for the last time, no!
what's the occasion?
homer!
uh, do i have to be gang-probed?
what did the aliens look like?
why do you hate the isotopes so much, dad?
even you?
that's a rotator cuff. his career's over.
but there's only been one pitch!
no, they lost.
with a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs.
quiet! we're watchin' the isotopes!
now we're in the championship game.
the inspiring words of a fan who'll always root, root, root for the home team, even if they lose this ga--
no, no, no, the game's not over --
nobody touched my rumaki.
isotopes!
slide!
we are the champions / we are the champions / you got mud on your face / big disgrace...
wow, you look really hungover, dad. what did you do last night?
whoa / curfew?
but it's not fair. adults always blame kids for everything!
what about adultery?
and here we are, locked inside.
meh.
hey, look what i found. grampa's old radio. oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?
we know all your secrets.
oh, homer...
tune in tomorrow, and every day until the curfew is lifted. because we'll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield's other adults.
kids! / you've had your fun, now we've had our fill.
we're gonna teach all of you rugrats a lesson!
you really should have voted, homer.
happy birthday, dad.
oooh, "free foot pain analysis?"
i guess.
um, dad...
oh, you betcha... absolutely... eh-- uh-oh, oh, oh, wait a minute. these tires won't take a balance.
well, that tells me you need four new tires.
yeah. legally, i can't even let you drive out of here on these.
uh, that's it. you're fired!
oh, i know that look. you came in for the free wheel balance and now it's costing you five hundred simoleans.
man, we are a couple of grade "a" suckers. wally kogen.
oh, don't remind me. "friends helping friends," my ass. say, you wanna grab a beer while we're waiting?
yeah, how 'bout that super bowl? you goin' this year?
well, i run the springfield travel agency. we've got a charter bus goin' down to the game. you help us fill it, you can ride for free.
yeah, you. get your hand off my wife's leg.
oh, absolutely. my favorite team's in it: the atlanta falcons . yeah, ever since i was a boy, i've always loved the atlanta falcons .
nah.
nah.
ahh.
i'm so happy you're going to the big game. my dream has always been to see the bolshoi ballet.
wow, you've signed up quite a few people, dad: sea captain, bumblebee man, comic book guy, the squeaky voiced teen...
yeah. not a dame in sight.
whooo!
man, that hurts.
yes, sir! i'm catching a pass from dan marino! this is the greatest moment of my...
hey, bubba. hacksaw. get that moron.
hey, i'm just tryin' to make an honest buck.
yeah. see, the hologram's missing. and there's no such team as the "spongos." and finally, these seem to be printed on some sort of cracker.
oh, how could i fall for fake tickets? gee, the fellas are gonna be crestfallen.
kill 'em!
wait, dad, look!
get back here!
you got my vote.
me? i'm dolly parton.
who's ready for some football?!
yeah. where?
what the bloody hell?
let... go... booze!
you know, your determination and grit under extreme pressure are an inspiration. the whole country is proud of you.
and on behalf of america, i'd like to...
dad, that doesn't belong to you.
well, we sure put together a heck of a trip, homer. ever thought about being a travel agent?
locked.
unplugged.
aw geez, there they got me living with an african-american, a semite-american and a woman-american, there. and i'm glad. i love youse all. i love everybody. i wish i'd saved my money from the first show.
isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
this isn't bad.
the renaissance.
well, let's just say i hate crime. arrest that guy. and that's the end of that chapter...
that's not really you, dad. he's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name.
no he's not.
hey homer! homer! check it out. bottom of page twelve.
hey, you're famous.
uh, mr. simpson, sir, can i get your autograph?
so they really based that homer simpson character on you, huh?
simp-sonnnn!!
hey, looks like they changed the character into a bumbling sidekick.
yeah, come on, dum-dum, do something unintelligent, there.
get ready, everybody. he's about to do something stupid.
haw haw.
but her forehead's on fire.
your catch phrase is hysterical. please say it clearly for my answering machine tape.
okay.
homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. why don't you talk to the producers of the show? maybe they'll make your character suave again.
bart?
stupid? well, i can assure you, it happened organically.
but it scared the hell out of us. so we slapped together a cop show instead.
policecops.
oh, he's not stupid. he's a street-smart, fish-out-of-water in a world he never made.
court finds in favor of "policecops." next case.
max power??
you changed your name without consulting me?
but this will be so confusing. the mailman won't know what to do. did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
and what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
oh, lord.
isn't that the wrong way?
ah! max power! how's every little thing?
well, who could forget the name of a magnetic individual like you? keep up the good work, max.
very well...
the man knows what he likes.
if you don't, who will, huh? trent steel.
oh, heyyy, great name.
leading him off) so, where to eat? you like thai?
when did you start liking thai food?
who's trent steel?
what's this wrapped in a banana leaf? mmm, smells like mint.
well, i guess your new name is really opening doors for you.
you are invited to a garden party this saturday!
wow, look at this place. the house number is spelled out with letters!
did you wish me to destroy this machine for you?
very nice, ed. your inventions continue to impress me and the entire nation.
oh, my lord! i feel like cinderella.
eh, maybe later.
ah, max power. trent said i absolutely must meet you. this is fab...
attention, please. attention. um, i just wanna say how thrilled i am with this turnout. i'm proud to share my home with springfield's best and brightest.
we've all been blessed with privilege and success.
uh, but with privilege comes grave responsibility...
we all have to give something back to the world that's been so good to us.
to the protest bus!
i don't know. remember that new year's eve at lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
you can't blame them for having a social conscience.
hang in there, max. saving the environment is a hard, grueling job.
something funny, nature boy?
keep runnin', max!
uh, you better call for backup, chief!
slow down, punk!
well, i'm glad you changed your name back to homer simpson.
g'night.
to what?
chesty larue?!
goodnight, homer.
that's not a fairy tale. it's just something that happened to you at moe's.
i didn't turn it on yet.
maybe we should not answer it, huh?
oh, yeah, homer's a real go-getter.
maybe we should leave.
you don't know what they're saying.
oh, i hope we didn't get apu in too much trouble.
worse than ever i am afraid. my shameful neglect has made her feel unloved. now, i fear she will leave me.
ooh, ooh, you are right, there's still seven days before valentine's. ah, seven chances to prove my love for sweet manjula.
dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the sunday paper.
i'd love to look at sculleryweek -- if you're through with it.
hey, look at this one. it's a poem. from apu!
oh, how romantic!
the only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
oh... just once, i'd like a parrot to say that to me. then the bird sang "i love the night life"... with clever new lyrics.
it's not that monkey card i found in the car, is it?
homer, i've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos.
oh, moe.
i got some of that myself. / oh, screw myself.
aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. how can we sabotage his labor of love?
hey, there he goes!
uh, homer, you're drivin'.
there he is. behind that shopping bag... a croissant? what the...? oh, that's right. they have breakfast at tiffany's now.
man, that smarts!
i told you we shouldn't have gone for long-term parking.
i got it. i got it. apu musta hired him to sing for manjula.
oh, that's very sweet. have a grammy.
don't be frightened. that tank's just peace corps surplus.
homer! what a delightful coincidence.
i have to deliver a message! it's the skywriter's code.
stop, you crazy fool, you'll kill us all!
homer? what in the world?
just when i think i have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses.
oh, homie. oh, they're beautiful. oh, i'm gonna snuggle your brains out.
well, seems as though we're just about at the halfway point, so why don't we call it intermission? oh! don't go too far. if you like cafeteria workers in beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half.
mom, to your left. he's letting you in. go!
so long, schlubs!
go ahead, drool all you want. ya can't hurt that finish. now, rain water, that'll strip it right off. sa-- aw, and i shouldn't have said that. c'mon, gil.
okay, you've got the undercoating, clear coating, rust proofing, underguard spray, gravelguard xj, vita-seal, repelzit... but if you wanna protect the paint, you better keep it in this tent.
yup. oh, then, after your final monthly payment, there's the routine c.b.p., or crippling balloon payment.
right.
yeah, you don't see many men driving the f series.
see? instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder.
you cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid canyonero. why can't you drive it?
i don't think you're gay. i just have to do my grocery shopping. now please gimme my keys.
so?
oh, i'll come watch you do nothing after i try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights. nobody will ever cut me off again!
no, your father drives like an old lady.
bart, they're not here to entertain us.
but dad, lemurs are nocturnal.
no!
get in! get in! c'mon, homer! jump!
looks like it's time for plan b. one, two, three, "b"! it's okay, homie. you can come out now.
stone philips again!
do you think there's anything great on nbc right now?
okay, fdr is in the white house, an ice cream cone costs a nickel, and a hot new tune by benny goodman is hitting the charts. the year is 1939.
let me guess. you travel back in time again?
easy, homer. i'll bring you back.
yeah, too bad we gotta work, huh, homer? homer?
come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair.
what?
okay, dad, we're ready.
oh, quit complaining. it's half the work of the divorced dad.
hysterical, but i traded my turn to lisa for her dessert.
she didn't say it yet!
the book fair?
oh, this is perfect!
sorry, dad. my mind is made up.
i can answer that. uncle sam needs to spend our tax dollars on the essentials: anti-tobacco programs, pro-tobacco programs, killing wild donkeys, and israel.
look, they have lincoln's hat!
america's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.
get out of archie bunker's chair! now!
look, he got chocolate on it!
really, that much? it's gonna cost ten thousand dollars to repair that document.
of course omnitouch understands that real money doesn't grow on trees. not these days.
we prefer to think of them as "keep-in-touch towers."
plus you've increased springfield's roaming capabilities 64 percent.
i guess...
ugh, that antenna is an eyesore.
what happened to my room?!
you gave away my room!
i can't believe you did this, dad. why didn't you put that thing in your room?
but where am i supposed to live?!
homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!
oh, that's not the point. we should report this to an omnitouch care-rep. people's privacy is at stake.
ohhh! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it!
dad, will you please tell bart to stop squeaking his chair. i'm trying to do my homework.
race ya!
i am trying to do my homework.
dad, why did you have to take away my room?
i just want to study.
that's awful!
my tummy really hurts.
is that somebody you, homer?
okay, then you can take lisa to dr. hibbert's.
yes... anyway, when it comes to stress, i believe laughter is the best medicine. you know before i learned to chuckle mindlessly, i was headed for an early grave myself.
i'm really not the chuckling type.
yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --
they're not all crazy, dad.
dad, you don't have to go to a new age store just for me. i know you think this stuff is stupid.
i just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.
namaste.
may i tell you about our white light specials?
fetal grindings. but i have a better idea.
no, mr. simpson, this is a sensory deprivation tank. it blocks out all the external distractions that bombard our souls.
i'll take two hours.
you're about to take a journey into the mind. you may see and experience things that are strange and frightening. but remember, they can't physically harm you, though they may destroy you mentally.
hi, dad. how was it?
pretty cool. but now, whaddaya say we go do something we'll both enjoy?
mmm.
well, you told her, dad.
i think i read somewhere that cows like being killed.
you didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
well, there is one steak that's only available by special request, uh... we call it, uh, "sir loin-a-lot." it's, uh, the size of a boogie-board.
very good, sir. ladies and gentlemen... this brave man has accepted the sir loin-a-lot challenge. he will pit his stomach against sixteen pounds of indomitable tenderloin.
red barclay's my name. i'm a trucker, and i've eaten steaks from coast to coast, with taters and toast. take my advice, this one's not for greenhorns.
it's an insult. sock him, dad. sock everybody.
no, homer! don't fill up on bread!
oh, humans are so ridiculous. he's not even halfway through walter and he's already hallucinating.
there goes the finest trucker who ever lived.
in 38 years, he never missed a shipment. but i guess this is one delivery ol' red won't be making.
oh no. oh, no...
oh, lemme go with you, dad!
good-bye, homer.
oh, all right. good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip.
well, you're not really a trucker now.
well, according to red's schedule, we have to make it to atlanta in three days.
no, dad. he wants you to blow your horn.
a little more high-test, darlin'?
i'll be right back with your pie, hon.
yeah.
will that be all, sweetie?
what about... erika?
uh-huh. bet he used bait, too.
actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours.
hey! you can't take that many pep pills at once!
yeah, that navitron auto-drive system's made our jobs cushier than ever.
you know, this thing. with this baby drivin' your truck for ya, all you gotta do is sit back and feel your ass grow.
sh-hey-hey-hey-sh! didn't your union rep tell you about the scam we got goin'?
well, well. / what's that? / will wonders never cease?
he hit us!
dad, they're trying to kill us!
dad, stop!
huh?
i'm afraid i can't let you do this, red. the risk is unacceptable.
yep. you're gonna make it, dad. and somewhere up there, i bet red is saying thanks.
all right, let's see... artichokes... aannnd migrant workers. lookin' good. so, where is ol' red anyway?
any thoughts on how we're gonna get there?
are you crazy? i'm not driving a trainload of napalm to springfield!
and as we pass the collection plate, please give as though the person next to you were watching.
thank you, helen. and thank you all for your kind contribu-- . a chocolate bunny?! who put this wicked idol in the collection plate?
uh, i guess.
speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?
good morning, adam. any bacon for you, then?
oh adam, you're too kind.
oh, how cute. let's call this little guy a "groundhog..."
really? well, what do you call that thing on the branch?
please stop eating that. god's gonna furious.
well, it is a sin to waste food...
lovely day in paradise, isn't it?
today i'm featuring mouth-watering pork ribs. tuck in, then!
i'm toiling! what does it look like?
well, it's a little late for apologies now.
and after i created my fingers to the bone for you i... my unicorn! oh, what have they done to you, gary?
oh, shut up. you are so banished.
king solomon, these men need you to settle a dispute. they each claim ownership of this pie.
oh, how embarrassing. oh, we slept right through church.
why aren't we ascending into heaven? oh, right. the sins.
dad!
homer!
i said homer!
i'm serious. you never finished painting the garage. and you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
yup.
hey, get off my case. the only reason i'm working here is 'cause i'm trying to get a date with "mom."
hi, i'm doug vaccaro. you know me as chip, the wisecracking assistant on the hit sitcom, "toolin' around."
how 'bout wild boar? or swordfish? or hippo?
light-hearted apron not included. snapping fingers may not make food appear.
can i burn evidence in it?
dad, i really need to rest my back.
yeah, hold on there, santa claus. that box is for toys only.
yeah, nice try, saint nick. now hit the road, kris kringle.
homie, someone's at the door. they want to talk to you about some sort of car accident.
mr. simpson? i believe something of yours struck my car yesterday.
i'm not here to sue you. my name is astrid weller. i own an art gallery and i'd love to display your piece.
art isn't just pretty pictures. it's an expression of raw human emotion. in your case, rage.
is everything okay? i got worried when i didn't hear any shots.
your husband's work is what we call "outsider art." it could be by a mental patient or a hillbilly or a chimpanzee.
dad, chew with your mouth closed. you're losing your mystique.
congratulations, homer -- you're now a professional artist!
where are you going with that junk, dad?
homie, i'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?
well, if it'll help - um, mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy.
i must get back to my hotel and practice my affectations for tomorrow. bon soir.
nothin', nothin'. just gimme a priceless sketch with a certificate of authenticity.
wonderful news, homer.
i'm happy for you. now g'night.
no, homer, being an artist was my dream. but now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than i have in my whole life.
that's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if i, i don't know, entered a belching contest?
you don't understand.
homer is the most dangerous artist on the springfield scene. now, let's see what surprises he has for us tonight.
i'll give you two bucks for the bird, if it's still alive.
come on, gunter, kyoto. if we hurry we can still catch the heroin craze.
homer, i know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same.
it's so exciting to do something cultural together.
a claes oldenburg. he's a european who defied convention and embraced american popular culture.
now this is a joseph turner. in an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the venetian canals.
and picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. by the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. they call it his "angry jerk" period.
soup's on, fat boy!
homer... homer...
well, dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like christo.
no, christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. he once wrapped the reichstag in plastic.
to make the world a more magical place, i guess. although they did blow over and kill some people.
no, dad, no. my point is you have to do something big and daring.
see you in hell, "god bless this house."
it wasn't easy, but i got all the grizzlies.
oh lord. what now? oh, that can't be good.
homer, what have you done?
well, homer, i have to admit, you created something people really love. you truly are an artist.
ohh...
that's us.
yeah, go for the gold, dad!
you papier mache'd my cat?!
good work, dad.
oh! / springs!
"coming! hey, hey, hey! children, children, future, future..."
are you talking to me or the beer?
poland, eh? ha. too easy. how you doin', germany? here's my impression of an east german woman, "kiss me or i'll crush you."
sounds good to me!
delivery for homer simpson.
but we lost the olympics to shelbyville.
to who?
homer, get outta here.
nothing.
are you okay?
i want you to get rid of these springs.
i want these springs out of our house today.
you're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?
what the heck's going on?
i don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. when was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
we're walking, homer.
oh, look! there's the store where i buy my yarn. but you don't want to buy your buttons there.
where'd you get that champagne?
all this commotion just for a store?
ha! all right. what's your name, young man?
well, i hope this starts you on your way to a great fortune. now, who wants the second dollar?
uh... well... all right. here. now...
i need your help. i want to be loved.
yes! that's the look i'm looking for. what would make you and your slovenly kind look at me that way?
a charitable donation, eh? well, there's a first time for everything. take this check for two hundred thousand dollars to the springfield hospital.
well, i will be when the morphine wears off, but until then, teedily deedily dee dee. teedily dee dee dee. woo hoo hoo. hee hee hee.
all right, let's get this geezer out quick so we can bring in the lesbian gladiators.
oh... what's the use? i'll never be a popular, beloved billionaire like arthur fortune.
and a stunt like that impresses people?
well, if a couple of chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, i'm gonna bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn of time.
ach. the whole town's turned out. i've never seen them so excited.
where's my monster, tubby? what do you people think i'm paying you for?
the beast looks something like this, only without the saucy t-shirt.
we're the laughingstock of the town.
nay. 'tis merely loch ness high school's discarded homecoming float.
i was really starting to enjoy ethnic mismatch comedy #644. i've never heard so many viagra jokes in thirty seconds.
attention springfield. how low will you go... to win a trip to -- hawaii? this saturday our judges will select the lowest, most disgusting nitwit in town... and send him straight to maui! sponsored by "grandma plopwell's." the low-fat pudding that's approved for sale... by the government!
next up, homer and his amazing reddenbacher dreamcoat, with a number he calls, "kernel knowledge."
all right, judges? who is our winner?
you won second place?
well, most of us. dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?
dad, stop kidding around. look, they printed my letter.
well, i'm sure someone had the time to read it.
all right, mr. simpson...
don't worry, these photos are perfectly legal. many husbands use them as a romantic gift for their wives.
well, yes, unless you have some issues with revealing your body.
oh dad, i just spent the day with the most wonderful people.
are you ready in there, mr. simpson?
just come out.
you look fantastic. let me just adjust my lens here.
light is not your friend. all right, let's do this thing.
homie? well, look at you...
homer, i've never seen this side of you! but i like it... wooh, wooh. look at those silk pillows. it's like the set of some high-class porno film!
hold on, wha-- that's our basement?
it looks so elegant. and all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. you've got to show me exactly what you did.
yeah, just try me you-- oh!
lisa, thank god you're okay.
who's up for some beers?
your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing, homer. i may have to steal it.
dad, it's not...
this is "wired." it's about computers and technology. hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in springfield! will you take me, dad? please? i'll show you how to order pizza over the internet...
bart! the internet is more than a global pornography network. it's a...
wow, dad, you're surfing like a pro.
dad, do we have any money left?
we were robbed?!
we were saving that money for our family vacation. now we're gonna have to start all over again.
evening, neighbor. low on funds again?
oh, we're not as well-off as you think. we give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. and the leftorium's business has gone way downhill since leftopolis moved in next door.
oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. they were evidence in a murder trial!
we got that tip at the chuck garabedian mega-savings seminar.
he taught us how to live a burt reynolds lifestyle on a mac davis income. we've already got tickets for his next seminar. i think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
squeeze every penny! squeeze every penny!
thirty-three cents? i paid almost double that. eww...
um, according to the mexican council of food, this expired two years ago.
this also says it can cause red tide poisoning.
come on, transylvania.
c'mon, homer! japan!
never mind. looks like the flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
come on, homer, japan will be fun. you liked "rashomon."
i never knew jim belushi made so many movies.
to-ga! to-ga! toga 2000!
homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open.
mom, lis! check it out. dad's on tv.
robots be right back.
me too. let's go to an authentic japanese noodle house!
and?
don't ask me! i don't know anything! i'm product of american education system. i also build poor quality cars and inferior-style electronics.
but you promised me we'd do something japanese.
hey, look. isn't that woody allen?
says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring.
tubby?
your wife has paid your bail, mr. simpson-san.
now can we do something japanese?
honey, i know you want to see japan, but we're down to our last million yen.
oh, it's beautiful, dad.
knife-ah goes in, guts-ah come-ah out, that's-ah what osaka seafood concern is all about.
don't patronize me! now, simpson family, have you picked a wish?
now our gameshows are a little different from yours. your shows reward knowledge. we punish ignorance.
okay, let's begin. our categories are "ow, that hurts," "why are you doing this to me?" and "please let me die."
mr. simpson, we'll cut you down as soon as you answer one question about japan.
congratulations simpsons, the airline tickets are yours. all you have to do is to pick them up...from inside that volcano.
this vacation really blows.
lisa!
don't worry, that "lava" is just orangeade made by our sponsor, osaka orangeade concern.
it's loaded with wasabi. kudos, simpsons, you have won your freedom!
ahh, folks, we're experiencing some moderate godzilla-related turbulence at this time, so i'm gonna go ahead and ask you to put your seatbelts back on. when we get to thirty-five thousand feet, he usually does let go. so, from there on out all we have to do is worry about mothra and uh, we do have reports he's tied up with gamra and rodan at the present time. thank you very much.
electricity: the fuel of the future. test drive the elec-taurus today and get a free gift.
bart! well, that shut me up.
well, it's always nice to meet people concerned about the environment.
boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier.
ah! dad, you're headed for the harbor!
i know, but we didn't.
perfect.
they're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring mel gibson!
who cares? mel gibson!
besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. people magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... homer, let's make love!
of course, homey. aren't you thinking about me?
"and he fought for them once, for the only reason any man ever does. because of one plain simple rule: love thy neighbor..."
it's not boring. he's passionate about government.
i liked it. it was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing.
eh, yes sir?
there you go.
i'm looking for homer simpson.
mr. simpson, i need your help.
i think you're right about my movie and i want you to help me make it better.
but, dad, i thought you hated...
don't sell your husband short, mrs. simpson.
i don't have much time, homer. will you come to hollywood with me?
dodge caravan.
can i stay with you, dad?
i don't think so.
you want me to replace the villain with a dog? i mean nobody'll know what's going on!
maybe this wasn't a good idea, homer. i'm sorry i dragged you out here. l-let me pay your bus fare home.
the filibuster scene? that was jimmy stewart's favorite!
you really think the end is boring?
okay, this new ending...
... is a little different than what we had, but i think you'll like it. it's missing some sound effects and the computer guys haven't added the twinkle in my eye...
yield this, senator payne... i move we impose some serious term limits!
but this was gonna be the studio's prestige picture. like "howard's end," or "sophie's choice."
who are you, anyway?
executive producer?
you put me down, you big lummox! je-eedd!!
homer! land mine!
well, that's it homer. we should've known better than to match wits with studio executives.
homer, what are you doing here?
oh, forget it, homer, let's just give 'em the stupid movie.
that really wasn't my intention.
oh sorry, honey, i used up the last roll on that man i thought was judge judy.
what are you doing?
will you please tell me the rest of the plan?!
no, they didn't. they attacked us in a horribly bloody battle. remember?
all in favor, say die! that digital sound really lets you hear the blood splatter.
i'm jimmy stewart's granddaughter and you'll be hearing from my attorney!
it's not your fault, homer. i guess there's just no room in today's crazy, gentle america for violent dinosaurs like us.
i blame the internet. and the return of swing music.
thank you for coming.
your son is a ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all that's good and true.
but worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who sits near him. just look at this pattern.
how should i know? the point is, a.d.d. makes children restless and easily distracted.
good lord. he's gotten into the pep closet!
check this out.
how will we get bart to take these?
medication?
tommy lee...
he's just flamboyant.
dad, i admit i have some problems, but drugs aren't the answer.
nice try, homer.
no, but here's a book called "chicken soup for the loser" that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats.
i think it's the bright blue pants. i mean, you're not on a golf course.
that's gonna save all kindsa travel time.
neyin war? dérdine?
that's right. you stay on the ball, you stay on the wall.
bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and i could have a night out!
i was thinking of something a little more... adult.
and then afterwards...
i heard about a new bar where men dance with men. doesn't that sound adorable?
i'm so glad you're here. bart's really acting funny.
it can read your electronic organizer from space.
who else? major league baseball.
i had a feeling this might happen. this carboxyl group sometimes causes problems.
no!
oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero.
i don't think he has diarrhea.
what a day. first the drinking fountain squirts me, and now this!
dad, that junkie is your son!
not the church! jesus lives there!
hey, at least i got to see some cool colors.
dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?
dingus!
i'm no hero. i just like to hit people in the head.
dad, that's an ambulance.
check it out, dad. you can print out the headline from the day you were born.
who are you and why are you ruining my retirement party?
well, at least you like the food.
i get the picture.
hey, listen, i just had a thought. we're looking for a new food critic. someone who doesn't immediately pooh-pooh everything he eats.
look, i'd like to give you a tryout. write a 500 word sample review. if it passes muster, we'll put you on staff.
you know, homie, the "e" doesn't work on that typewriter.
this is a joke, right? i mean, this is the stupidest thing i've ever read.
aw, look, homer, i'm sorry, but...
well, we went to paté labelle last week. how 'bout that?
the food is delicious.
hm. what's the english equivalent for ? i'd say... transcendent.
497... 498 words. hmph.
bon appetit.
not bad... not bad at all. we're gonna run this on page one! of section h-2.
that takes four hours!
here you are, one critic special. if anything appears to be moving, that's just freshness. arrr.
yeah, now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt, we'll be on easy street.
wow, my first published article. although someone else's name is on it.
and there's that awful script from the cable guy!
hey, homer, great call on that chicken place. and on that rib place. i never knew everything was so good.
hey homer, c'mere!
no.
some of your fellow critics wanted to meet you ... this is garth trelawny, tv critic...
homer, please!
jamie kilday, farm supply critic. just got back from the gopher poison show in paris. let me tell you something, people. the days of clubbing them with a baseball bat are over.
listen, we've been meaning to have a talk with you about your reviews. everything's a rave! nine thumbs up? what the hell is that?
well, the only bad review you gave was to a slice of pizza you found under the couch.
you don't have to patronize me.
it's not!?
dad, that's so mean.
but what if someone bad tells me to...
who wants pork chops?
you always liked my pork chops.
you like shake and bake. you used to put it in your coffee.
oh, yeah? what's a palate?
not anymore. i don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
ruff!
chewy?
homer, what gives with this review? you say the salad tastes like "bark", the potatoes were very . this reads like it was written by a dog.
homie, my women's intuition's acting up. something bad's going to happen if you go in there.
i'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
we can find him faster by splitting up. you take fried foods. you take salty snacks. i'll take desserts. break!
a rude frenchman? well, i never!
don't! uh... um... it's low-fat!
lou and his frittatas. oh, he likes eggs.
what bad things? why?
uh, dad?
i'm having a hard time seeing. homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?
ned flanders!
they'll never believe a simpson killed a flanders by accident. even i have my doubts.
neddy? where have you been?
well, come on down, you goofy roofy.
my pies are done!
... and now ned's best friend will say a few words. homer?
shut up! shut up! shut up!
no more murders.
who could be calling at this hour?
i know you're alone.
is this maude flanders?
i'm making record time on this fog walk! ooo, better pick up the pace. 
yeah...
remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite!
hey, homer. weren't you the plant's y2k compliance officer?
you did fix them, right dad? because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world.
oh, no. it's happening.
who's going to clean up all those jets? there goes the clothesline.
it's got a computer chip in it. everything does.
i don't want you looting!
well, look at the wonders of the computer age now.
i think that was implied by what i said.
they're evacuating the earth! we're saved!
there it is!
they must be starting a new civilization on mars with our best and brightest.
name please.
uh-huh. and your name is?
hey, look, another spaceship!
are you still talking about the earth?
wait a minute. they're not so great.
yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth? i mean, my shows weren't great, but i never tied people up and forced 'em to watch. and i could've. 'cause i'm a big guy. and i'm good with knots.
hey, turn those frowns around!
don't worry, dad. we'll be dead in five minutes.
do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?
i'm sorry, but we're not supposed to put butter on the milk duds.
your honor has been insulted! this will not stand.
are you crazy, dude?
the dude is crazy!
my hero!
all right, take it easy. take it easy. i'm just saying you ain't no, uh, tommy tune.
i-- your what now?
hey, a duel? i, ah-- isn't that a little extreme? here, here, have a free beer.
yeah, i ain't never been slapped with no duelin' glove before, either.
you'll need a will and headstone, aisle six.
yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you.
oh, no!
why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
oooh, yes indeedy, homer. looks like they're settling in for a long stay.
to continue talking, please deposit ten cents.
where are we gonna live?
that has people living in it. you can see them through the windows.
you have offended me, suh. i challenge you to-- come back here! why, you yellow belly...
where are we going, dad?
then why are you driving so fast?
you mean grampa's old farm?
holy moly, we can't stay here. it's full of raccoons.
are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
i'll repress the rage i'm feeling.
it doesn't sound very tractor-y.
well, well, look at the city slicker pullin' up in his fancy german car.
well pardon us, mr. gucci loafers.
well la-dee-da, mr. park-avenue manicure.
you're not gonna grow nothin' on the old simpson place. that's why your daddy abandoned it.
wow, dad, this is the juiciest watermelon i ever tasted.
what are you planting?
paw!
maybe it needs more fertilizer.
dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at krusty-burger.
wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out?
it's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?
you got that from a movie poster!
is that plutonium on your gums?
but it's only been one night.
yeah, but didn't grasshopperus kill chad everett?
oh.
wait, dad, you don't have to kill yourself.
something's growing.
what is it? carrots? peas? maybe it's okra.
maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
"tomacco?" that's pretty clever, dad. i mean, for a product that's evil and deadly.
excuse me, mr. farmer man. i promised my son he could tip over his first cow, and i... "tomacco?"
i was here first! / c'mon, c'mon people!
don't forget your mincemeat pie!
homer, we're in a bit of a pickle. kids are crazy about tobacco, but the politicians won't let us sell it to them.
tell me about it. but there's no law against selling kids tomacco. that little "m" is worth a lot of money to us... and to you.
... million dollars.
shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
give them the plant, homer!
well! what a lovely gift. gotta run!
i don't mind if i do.
you okay, dad?
dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for.
num num, maggie. num num.
homer!
all right, smart guy. where's the fire?
turn around, simpson.
hey homer, what gives?
oh no, not lenny. not lenny!
poo. uh, homer, what wacky name do you want?
yeah.
simpson! even for a bowler, you're fat!
hey, homer. that's four strikes in a row. you got a perfect game going!
oh, right. sorry. miss! miss! sorry, i was calling the waitress. ah, this split you sold me is making me choke.
hey, spare me your gutter mouth. ow!
now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. so we'll just stay here and not disturb him.
ho-mer! ho-mer!
mr. simpson bowled a perfect game without the aid of steroids, crack, angel dust, or the other narcotics that are synonymous with pro bowling.
will you be my dad?
uhhh, homer...
make me center square, kent! i'm ready. i can handle it.
ohh, we've got to stop putting these flavors of the month on.
yeah, homer, you can't just ride one accomplishment forever. why do you think i stopped acting and became a director?
now before my partner teller hits the shark-infested water, i'll need to borrow someone's crossbow. i only need one. now to save my partner's life, i'll need complete...
would you shut up?!
he'll do it! i'm not the first teller!
that's right! you are!
burt reynolds, class act. well now, for our segment, "yesterday's news"... featuring homer simpson. are you as bored as i am with the antics of this warmed-over fred flintstone? i say it's time to put this one-trick pony out to stud.
dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside.
are you comparing yourself to our lord?
ohhh, homey, is that what's bothering you?
well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.
hey, mr. s. i didn't know you bungeed.
no, no! you're too heavy!
hey, look out! oh, dumbass, trying to get yourself killed?
look, i'd love to help you out, homer, but i'm taking my kids to the zoo.
really? you have children? oh, well look, here's some money.
usually when you say that, you give the money back.
if you tie a string around your finger real tight, you can make it turn purple.
mr. simpson, you're going to be fine. although you do seem to have swallowed a number of shark eggs.
it's quite simple -- when a parent's life is in danger, a child can summon superhuman strength.
these swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. i mean, a green table! i wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams.
you put it together yourself. all you need is me, allen wrench.
hello, simpsons!
well, sure we have, but the decision to have a child is not to be made lightly. mm. on the other hand, monkey see, monkey do!
by chilling my loins, i increase the chances of impregnating my wife.
just stop spouting those hackneyed quips.
you know, homer, you might want to open those cans before they explode.
no, still no luck. tell me, homer, did you have to take any special steps when you decided to have children?
well, not to us they don't. oh homer, we have tried everything! oysters, gravity boots, sanjay's bed, every possible position...
eh, yes.
i'm willing to play the high school jock, but did you have to cut the roof off my car?
just promise not to forget me on your dinosaur-bone-digging-up trip...
homer!
you have octuplets. it rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
mm-hmm. well, that would only account for quintuplets. did anyone else slip this woman fertility drugs?
you know, i saw apu today. he's really frazzled.
apu told me all eight babies have colic. although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.
yes, dear. from the nuclear plant.
knock, knock!
let's hear it for dazzle!
oh, my little treasures. we'll get you out of this terrible place. she's waking up!
it's not just you prancin' around in a monkey suit, is it?
we'll do our best, chutney-butt.
hey, remember the fifties? remember television, coca-cola, and dick clark?
why don't we eat there tonight?!
it's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.
dad, they have those everywhere.
well, well, well, i've never seen such reckless disregard for a wife's well-being in my life. you've just won yourselves a motorcycle!
man, you're bending the hell out of that kick-stand, dad. why don't you just take it for a ride?
yeah, i promise.
you're kidding? you don't know how. 
sweet hog, mr. simpson.
will you turn that engine off?
look what you've done! you've ruined the display!
never, pops.
the chri... i-i-i don't think you understand my objection...
hell's satans, huh? i'm watchin' you punks.
you'll make a mistake some day. and then you're going straight to juvie.
cobras? i thought you were the hell's satans.
you took a picture of me when i was asleep?
we're the hell's satans, out of bakersfield.
take off that jacket, man.
now eat it.
you got anything else with our logo on it?
you gotta eat them, too.
yeah, it's part of being a lowlife.
forget it, simpson. those pig noises you made really hurt my feelings -- looking like a pig as i do.
no, we're not.
and why aren't i at school?
dad, there's a note on the back of your head.
hm. "thanks for letting us crash in your pad. we had a very nice time."
yeah, i did see some bikers ride by here with a blue-haired woman, 'bout ten minutes ago. said they were gonna spend the night at crystal lake campground, section k, space 217. i'm sorry i can't be of more help.
homer, homer, stop it! we've given up our violent ways. we just want to live peacefully, with your wife.
fight! fight! fight! fight!
we both knew it would come to this.
homer!
hey, can we at least keep her till the orgy in san berdoo?
no!
why are we stopping here?
oh, no! it's dad! 
uh, we're drunk. really drunk!
what will become of our kids?
i've got a motorhome i never use. maybe we should raffle it off.
check it out. i'm breaking books at a sixth-grade level.
this broom closet is not what it seems. it's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot.
thus saving christmas.
yes. the madness ends here.
no, bart, he's right. i did oversimplify.
well, there's something you don't see every christmas.
hey, dad... what if we...
cloning is a troubling issue.
she cleaned out the attic!
/ push! /
i'll never get rid of this useless junk.
you guys never use any of this stuff. look at these. you bought them after the nagano olympics, and never skied once. if you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe...
look dad, it's the drummer from bread!
i'm sorry!
hi-didly-ho, schuss in boots.
well, it allows for maximum mobility. feels like i'm wearing nothin' at all!
have you been in here all day?
no wonder. look at this. that oughta hold it.
i can't be in the hospital! tomorrow is laundry day. and i've gotta de-meat lisa's baloney.
no they won't. we'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? guys...?
good lord! you're wasting thousands of dollars worth of interferon.
dad, where are your clothes?
don't tell me mom dresses you.
okay, now we're gonna draw jobs from the chore hat.
will you at least do the dishes?
oh! you're gonna be late. here are your lunches. and no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
you're dead, squealer.
no it's not!
dad, i gave you a list!
oh, couldn't be better.
polo!
polo!
will this do?
ohh, i don't like the looks of this.
let's see... crusty sores...
... horrible wailing...
excellent.
now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. i'll get you a couple of mops.
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude. yeah, that sounds right.
brains... brains...
all right, food!
uh, listen, homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. i'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you.
whoa! this is a hospital?
oh, you'll have a great view of the whole beach... from the electric needle room.
yes, from the electric needle room.
yeah, we know.
no way. we scored a free hawaiian vacation.
number one, report to the dermabrasion hut.
dad, you only took one course.
there's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party...
you went to springfield u. you hate a & m.
does anybody need that much porno?
seal the exits. thank you, thank you. c'mon, hurry it up. all right now, let's empty our pockets.
professor rocco, chancellor knuckles?
we look like slobs.
good evening, gentlemen.
i tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
oh, now don't fret. these days, the victims of comedy traumas -- or "traumedies" -- can still lead rich, full lives. sorry, but these guys crack me up.
okay. hang on, homer. two eye holes coming up!
wow! is there anything he can't do?
brother, i sense you are feeling trapped and desperate.
i have the power!
hallelujah!
that's nice, but maybe your homecoming float should have something to do with college.
i think godzilla's bigger than superman.
but church can be fun. no, really. it can be a crazy party, with clouds and lasers and miracles.
ah, ha, excuse me, neighbor... ah, yeah, i, i couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers.
my thesaurus... you'll lose more than that. in preparation for the big game, springfield stadium has caught additional-seating-capacity fever.
a & m is gonna kick your ivy-covered butts!
whoa nelly, we have ourselves a barnburner here today! welcome to the 117th dust-up between the snortin' swine of springfield a & m and the springfield university nittany tide. ohhh, doctor! break out the hickory switch!
do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
now, ladies and gentlemen, pour a little cider on those peepers, 'cause here comes the half-time parade!
an overdue tribute to halftime itself! and as those lumbering ships of the gridiron sail off into our memories, the players return to the field.
then, what's this?
hey, look out! / look out!
i wagered a large sum on the performance of that scholar-athlete.
well he'd better, or else!
sorry, dad. i can't just magically cure a broken leg.
i know, is phony major. lubchenko learn nothing. nothing!
springfield community!
hey hey!
seat filler.
i can't help it if i donated the most blood. oh, i'm feeling kinda woozy.
homer, sit down.
oh, okay... let's see... i don't have a speech prepared, but uh, abra-cadaver... "thank you all so much. i love springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..." i'm not reading this drivel. this speech is over.
that's not an award, that's part of the set.
don't worry about a thing. we'll take good care of your house!
seems a little wasteful.
i'm princess margaret!
mom! bart's making faces at me. i think.
this all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes. hmm, i know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?
homer, did you jimmy open mr. burns' liquor cabinet?
stop swirling, homer!
homer, who are you calling?
well, don't run up mr. burns' phone bill.
all i'm saying is don't get too comfortable. mr. burns will be back tomorrow.
party? no! no parties.
no partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials...
how 'bout tuborg? the beer of danish kings.
when it gets to here, we can drink again.
sorry. two p.m. or you can steal a boat and sail out to international waters.
no, the ocean. once you get twelve miles out, there's no laws at all. that's where they held the tyson/secretariat fight.
oh no, you don't! i'm not going to let you trash mr. burns' yacht.
the boat's going sideways!
well, could you at least give us rubbing alcohol for our wounds? hey. sucker. ow!
wow, you can do anything out here.
arrr, i now pronounce ya man and cow. please accept these illegal fireworks with my blessing. yarrr.
uh, not really, no.
aye aye, captain.
navy seals are on the way.
how 'bout a tactical nuclear strike?
some party, homer.
hey, you're in the net, too.
and now we will cut you loose. for liability purposes it is the ocean that will kill you, not us.
hey, what do you know? it floats.
ugh. the foul stench of youth! well, let's see. ming vase on narrow column, not knocked down... priceless coins not used in vending machine... ... yes, not bad.
ah, it's good to be home.
bart, stop that! now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here.
shhh.
homer, give him the fifty cents.
just go.
who are those pleasant old men?
but first we'd like to dip into our new cd...
you get up every morning / to the alarm clock's warning / take the eight-fifteen into the city...
workin' overtime...
we just did!
homer, lisa's in that.
zing!
excuse me. but i believe this family already had a horse, and the expense forced homer to work at the kwik-e-mart with hilarious consequences.
oh, my. ooh-hoo. it's going to cost us $500 a week to keep duncan!
at least you don't have to feed any of the stuff i bought at the fair. well, except the mop.
hey, dad.
this horse is pretty fast. maybe we can race him.
dad, if we're gonna race duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?
really? i thought i was the only one.
you mean horseshoes?
you really think that horse can run a mile and a half?
duncan's really fast, dad. he was just intimidated by those other horses.
is that duncan?
you're quite a trainer, mr. simpson. care to join us for a beer in the jockey's lounge?
these are our real voices! we only talk like this on your surface world.
your renegade horse is making us frown!
your horse must lose!
we'll eat your brain.
you want me to lose the springfield derby? but you always taught me that winning was everything.
maybe. but if duncan wins the derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud.
huh?
hey, need any help, homer?
we'll give you gold!
now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. everything we pack in, we pack out.
use this plastic bag.
they sound angry... and africanized.
the bird sanctuary -- they ruined it!
show us your boobs, show us your boobs.
that's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned.
c'mon! somebody crash!
let's go! let's go! the dice! the dice! the dice! eight seconds! great job, boys!
we're going as fast as we can, ma -- hey, who are you?
and now, here's something for the guys...
you heard him, girls.
fire!
no, i really mean it, though. i mean if it was you that died, i would have been on her so fast...
now homey, you know, ned and the boys need us. and you know what that means.
now if there's anything, anything at all i can do to help out...
that's nice of you homer, but i think i'll just go to bed.
homer, this really isn't necessary...
hey, that's my sprinkler.
aw, homer. you don't have to...
no, homer! i just need to talk.
i just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. i can't believe my last words to maude were "no foot-longs."
if i'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here.
why are you taping flanders, dad?
do you even have a job anymore?
okay, i finished the gardening sequence.
dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes.
tape?
is this a dating video?
so that's why you maced me.
homer!
what are you doing, homer?
ewwww.
homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? it just feels way too soon.
got it.
you think she would?
sherlock holmes is a character.
you're darn right you are! and you've got lots of other great qualities, too.
what floozies? what are you talking...
you're watching pbs?!
do shut up?
me eyes! / oh, i'm scalded, i am!
classic. not hard to see why it's england's longest-running series. and today, we're showing all seven episodes.
and now, it's time to go back to "do shut up."
and the next twenty callers will get this album of museum noises. now your music room can sound just like... the metropolitan museum in new york -- outstanding.
you know, i've worked with so many legendary actors over the years who could be counted on to "phone it in". well, now it's your turn to phone it in -- your pledge, that is. please, please, we're only ten thousand dollars away from returning to our show.
dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars.
our pledge-enforcement van will be at his house in moments.
they don't show police chases, do they?
well said, homer. and now, for the moment of generosity...
absolutely.
get in there.
you are on television. please play along. are you robbing me?
um... is there a problem, mr. simpson?
you don't have the money, do you homer?
silly goose. why didn't you say so? get 'im, boys.
oh, why did i teach him that word?
ellmeaux knows where you live.
the word is "drive."
homer, how would you like to be a missionary in the south pacific?
sorry, no can do.
no, no. you can even keep in touch with him on this ham radio.
welcome aboard, brother! you must be homer! i'm craig, that's amy. well, see ya.
don't let the bed bugs bite. seriously.
welcome, reverend homer. we look forward to learning about the bible from you.
we can not read.
are you enjoying your ox testicle?
oh, we call that . sorry, fish bone in my throat. we call that "earthquake."
i am oovilu-eeoo-kitana-wanjay.
craig and amy were also building a chapel.
i told you we should have asked them.
cou-ouch?
oh, god. oh, god. oh, god! oh, god!
hello? is there anybody in there?
homer, are you all right?
i just don't think it's funny!
dad?
i just want to tell you how proud i am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
oh, yes. the whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. ned flanders is green with envy.
oh, god! oh, god! oh, god!
amy said there are lots of religions. which is the right one?
um, if the lord is all powerful, why does he care whether we worship him or not? ak just saying...
ooh, tell us all you know about nuclear power.
the lucky savage?
yes, sir. number six.
homer, i'm so impressed. everything you're doing sounds so rewarding.
how can ace be one and eleven? huh? what kind of god would allow that?
since when?
no, really.
don't panic! don't panic! don't panic!
you set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
okay, our first event qualifies for course credit at dartmouth college -- trick pouring!
now our final round, which counts for ninety-eight per cent of the total score, making the previous rounds a complete waste. don't forget, today's winner will be immortalized on our new duff calendar.
when i get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.
those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. and if bart gets a wowwipop, i want a wowwipop.
i can't believe they put those stickers over my face. i must be the ugliest man alive.
the little rat eyes...
or be with.
beautiful.
so this is all real?
yeah, hello yourself. i'm moe szyslak. back in high school, i asked you to the springtime pumpkin dance, and you turned me down. well, i just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'.
apology? uh, geez, i wasn't expecting that... uh...
okay, last stop. channel 6.
hey, there are women in our bar!
ah, i'm a little busy, homer. ah, you can pour it yourself.
i didn't bring you back to life so you could make a fool of me at the club.
i've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. but the one hole i've never been able to fix is the one in my soul.
"top secret story lines?!" uh, i'll sign for it. eh, might as well have a little peek... hmm. looks like my character gets back together with that evil contessa.
precisely. then i get in a skydiving accident and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?! they're killing off dr. tad winslow!
well, how could i say no to such a captivating...
whoa, it's the door.
and what do you have to tell us, oh, angel of the future?
how tragic. tell me more.
ooh, that's unexpected. what else?
stickin' it to you for killin' off my character!
folks, you're gonna want to turn around. the bugs are firmly in charge.
please, just go! they've taken the visitors' center! they, they ate the comment book!
hey, an indian casino!
homer, you know i had a gambling problem.
yeah, but i really wanna...
yo, it's me.
don't you mean present?
isn't that made of people?
but i want some.
what happened to you, man? you used to be cool.
nah, you've changed, man.
don't you think we should wait for lisa? she is the president.
wait! how do you know this is where lincoln buried the gold? you just started counting from an arbitrary place.
your plan makes no sense.
gold bars discovered by homer?
"dear countryman: you have come in search of my gold, and i will not disappoint you."
it's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..." well, isn't that clever? it's a metaphor.
i can't believe it only comes fifty-two times a year.
looks like milhouse's mom finally threw out his "blanky." he'll pay a lot to get this back.
dad, that's a sports bra.
behold, i am king talkie-tiki!
do not anger talkie-tiki! i am all-power--
what are you, nuts?
mr. gumbel, you're upsetting me.
oh, i'm a disgrace.
i'll show you. i'm gonna take these helicopter lessons.
i knew you'd be back. santeria, you're the greatest!
i know, but it's so hard. please help me, homer.
east st. louis?
ah, welcome back, homer. i see you've finally hit rock bottom.
well, your recovery begins today. and we promise you all the sugar cookies and second-hand smoke you can handle.
they're on that table over there.
yeah, someone who makes our alcoholism seem less raging.
see, homer? it's not so bad. now dance, rummy!
you danced for hours just because they told you to?
wanna go for a ride?
those are all priceless memories, homer, but i don't want to do that stuff anymore.
i didn't say that.
oh, don't be that way, homer.
so how was your ride with barney?
well, you still have lenny and carl.
well, if barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. old friends stick together, like o.j. and a.c., or the falcon and the snowman.
oh, hello homer.
beer, huh?
then we agree.
i will.
good day, then.
ta.
hiya, moe.
this is a channel six news bulletin. fire has broken out on mount springfield, trapping two youngsters and their camera.
i can't. i've never flown solo!
i know, i know! i haven't learned right turns yet.
yes! i need it!
you can't drink 'em all.
you brave man. you took six silver bullets for me.
dad!
dad, help!
you did it, dad!
no, you saved our lives.
well, i'm glad we're friends again.
here's the mail, dad. that'll be three dollars for on-couch delivery.
this isn't real money. it's printed by the montana militia.
i'm betting it's hunger and rage.
dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. you're supposed to open the magazine.
well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away.
six months ago. you were at the funeral. you fell into the grave.
no, no, no, nick. he's so good to his mother.
homie, for god's sakes, it's two a.m.
now what's wrong?
well, maybe you added it wrong. let me add it...
oh, honey, don't panic. if you just made a few lifestyle changes...
maybe you should see a doctor, homie. a head doctor.
well, we've got a soloflex down at h.q. anyway, everything looks great, mr. burns. i can't find a single violation or employee acting strangely.
of course not. he's just a harmless maniac, here to remind us of the precious gift of sanity. b... oh, god! what's he doing?
you hate your father, don't you?
i shouldn't have brought that up. i was just venting. anyhoo, i think your fear of death is causing your insomnia, which is provoking your erratic behavior.
what you need is a good, long rest. i suggest florida.
quiet, you two! you know your father's had a breakdown.
take 'em off the glass! take 'em off the glass! this looks like a terrible place to relax. we're gonna get you to a-- 
i trust you, honey. sweet dreams.
yo, yo, straight out of detroit, y'all, it's the j-o-e to the c! let's rock the party with kid rock!
my name is kiiiidddd kid rock!
thank you! it's the pimp of the nation, kid rock, tearin' it up at spring break, y'all! now, what we'd like to do next is bring it down for a minute.
but this ain't no forty-ounce curb. so, we're gonna need forty gallons, y'all!
no, sir... please don't tell mama.
oh, thank goodness. where were you?
nah, boys will be boys. i reckon he was just blowin' off a little steam.
the world looks to us -- the college students -- for leadership.
the gi-ant gator!
you killed captain jack! you in a heap o' trouble, son.
you see, during spring break the beer companies pay me to look the other way. the rest of the year, i'm a real hardass. okay, sweet pea, you're next. whoa, looks like we got a teeny houdini here. well don't you worry, darlin'. i got some baby-cuffs in the station.
you can't drive, dad. he's got your license.
there's lots of good places! what about over there?
homer no. you'll kill us all.
dad, what do we do?!
hey, where is dad?
this family has hit a new low. we're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... and it's all your fault.
a diner!?
i like your honesty. you're hired. and you two haven't said a word. i like that. you're hired.
no thanks.
scat.
go on now.
too hot to bicker, i reckon.
got that right. / durn tootin'. / boy howdy.
you just relax. i'll have you in jail by supper time.
well, first up is the state of florida vs. the simpson family.
no listening. you hear me?
simpson, we got a problem. the jazz pianist didn't show up.
well, we're still welcome in north dakota and arizona.
i can streamline any procedure, except this thing you call "love."
homer, sitting that close to the tv can't be good for you.
you should get your eyes checked. i'm taking bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
we need something quick. my husband's eyes are really shot.
dad, i've got maggie.
okay, let's get started. hey, wake up.
now, read the first line.
that pair is popular with celebrities like val kilmer...
and yoko ono...
maybe you're a candidate for laser eye surgery.
well yes, but i must warn you, it's an experimental procedure and we still don't know the long-term effects...
now homie, when we get to the liquor store, buy me some jack daniels and a carton of smokes.
why does it have a picture of vitamin barn?
and you will be a dancer.
and you look adorable.
where's lisa?
there she is! hi, honey! wow, look at her go.
stop clapping!
oh, thanks, dad.
i was merely trying to spare the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.
forget it, dad. i guess i'm never gonna be your broadway baby.
sure. it could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
uh-oh. it's out of its matrix. nobody move.
no knife games on the kitchen table!
dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!
becky, what have i done here? i'm so sorry.
becky, i know you must feel awful. but at least this didn't happen after you were married.
actually, that was becky, too.
well, nobody's perfect. let me just pick those out.
be right back.
awww. / oh, no.
shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
the kids are saying if you say bloody margie five times, she'll appear. but then she gouges your eyes out.
oh. well, then, i guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. except you cutting my brakes!
mom!
... onto the sands of superstar bay. but behind the chortles, this funny fivesome was trapped in a private hell.
nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. they almost drove me to fortified wine!
i'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that hollywood hogwash.
home improvement...
i haven't done the laundry yet.
dad, that's too much deterge--
simp-son!!! where's my dinner?!
okay, the material was a little corny, but homer and i had real chemistry onscreen.
r-u-p-e-r...
...-t.
the funniest stuff came right out of real life.
dad, i've never said "cowabunga!" in my life. your script sucks.
right, and the award for "best hardcore thrashmetal" goes to... "simpsons' christmas boogie"?! for america's favorite family, everything was coming up roses... but those roses contained ready-to-sting bees. when we come back...
the script originally called for me to jump the gorge. but i'd been up all night paying people to kiss, so dad volunteered to do the stunt.
the sequence became an instant comedy classic. but what the audience didn't see was the unfunny aftermath... somehow, homer became addicted to painkillers. it was the only way he could perform the bone-cracking physical comedy that made him a star.
the tax men were merciless.
something that swings, with the beat of new orleans.
swings!
sadly, this argument was not part of the act.
oh, that's it!
but now the wing was on fire... and the prayer had been answered by satan. after the state fair fiasco... none of the family were speaking to each other. fox put the show on hiatus, and replaced it with hidden camera footage from the dressing room at ann taylor.
as a young female artist, i really love living in this east village loft. oh, that must be our new landlord, mr. stingeley.
that's assault! that is assault.
thank you, taco, for that loving tribute to falco. and now, to present the award for "most violent rap group," homer simpson!
the simpsons' bitter past was forgotten, and now the future looks brighter than ever for this northern kentucky family.
so you know it's great.
i can't believe it. we won another contest!
i don't like you ogling her. why don't you read "cathy"? she's hilarious.
maybe i'd better check mine. "today, your husband will die." homer, i'm scared.
yeah, it's quite fetching, but, uh, aren't you worried about the deadliness?
no dessert until you eat your broccoli.
sure is easy when they're stiff like this. and very sad.
homer, settle down. i'll give you a chance to get into heaven. you have twenty-four hours to go back and do one good deed.
it's a miracle! thank heavens!
oh, i'm so sorry, i wasn't looking.
no, you're thinking of santa claus.
oh, it's not so bad... ow! i just got over the plague.
maybe you could be a dunce, father.
hey!
but husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?
that's it! into the oven with you! 
father, i knew you'd rescue us!
uh, hello, i'm george cauldron. is suzanne ready yet?
speaking of which, how about seconds?
those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. we've gotta warn grampa.
that was you?!
i, i, i tuned out. where we goin'?
oh, no. you poor thing. here...
ha ha ha ha ha. 
no, there's a badger in there.
tons.
no, dad! we don't want to kill him! let's call animal control.
your call cannot be completed as dialed. please make sure you have the correct area code.
the phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939.
geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers.
i'm not sure which one's better. the 6 is closer to the 3, so you've got convenience there, but the 9 has less to do with satan, which is a plus in this religious world of ours.
... 0, 1, 1... aaannnd 3.
ahoy hoy.
congratulations, you're gonna rendezvous with the who!
you should call that radio station and let 'em have it.
it's a movie, dad.
i like it.
i never!
/ he's right. / we're gettin' it but good.
it worked on the test-corpse.
viva la revolución!
say, i couldn't help but overhear. i represent the arizona cardinals...
yeah, maybe you oughta be mayor of new springfield.
presenting our new plaque. i say the time for bitterness has passed. let us extend to our brothers in new springfield the olive branch of...
go ahead and laugh! we have a better town bird!
the bluebird.
more wheat cakes, mr. mayor?
if you ask me...
... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. it would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
that's not true.
as expected, new springfield's bold experiment in slob rule is a disaster.
you c'mere a minute.
dad, i don't think this is such a good idea.
in retaliation for the power outage, olde springfield patriots have intercepted a beer truck bound for new springfield and dumped all the beer in the river.
i don't know. vengeance is pretty good.
like the one in berlin?
homer...
'bout what?
bye homer.
dad, you're bleeding.
don't give up, dad. maybe we can get the who to play here instead.
can i help you?
dad, the chloroform!
yeah, we don't want to lose our pool privileges.
the mayor of new springfield?
the crazy mayor of new springfield?
sacred bond.
we'll do it. just send a cab for us.
we were expecting a bigger crowd.
and we don't know "pacman fever."
give us back our concert, simpson!
all right, enough chit chat. let's see how ya like flaming garbage!
uh, says you.
okay, we'll play "magic bus" if you tear down this wall.
oh hell, i'll do it myself...
or is it?
i said, or is it?
homer, what are you doing?!
ooo, baby.
oh, yeah? you didn't blow up maggie's room.
you've ruined all my stuff.
well, the book festival starts today...
mmmm.
catch, dad, catch!
mm, i think i've found my mentor. you know, homer, i've spent my whole life entertaining kids, and i just realized i don't know the first thing about 'em.
dad! dad!
daaaad!
fold-o-rama.
no.
oh yeah, right. just let me go to my car.
i'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering.
my daughter's violin!
really? you'd help me take on the mob?
it's some kinda mafia summit! every mob family in the country's here: the cuomos, the travoltas, the lasordas, the boy-ar-dees...
it's gonna take forever to go through all these!
that's him! that's the one! homer simpson!
oh, all right. / fair enough. / he's a class act.
well, maybe i should.
i guess.
oh, how cute! kids, look who's on the roof!
i can't believe how young he is. he'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.
shut up!
you're welcome to come, too.
mom, dad, there's something i have to do. you're not gonna like it, but i really believe it's the right thing.
it's okay, mom! i have a safety line!
this was her choice, mr. simpson.
dad, i'm not dead!
homer, ah, booze is on the house, seeing as how lisa is, ah,... how do i put this... uh, ridin' the midnight train to slab city.
dear moe, if anything should ever happen to me, i want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... dad, i can't--
i'm not dead! and neither is my sense of moral outrage.
not my company! 
you gave bart one.
i just buckled down and studied.
deadbeat. deadbeat. deadbeat.
they're getting away / stop them, mary-kay!
no, no. your playing, while technically proficient, lacks passion.
when did this happen? when did we become the bottom rung of society?
dad, what happened to the back seat?
maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
well, i see you have several mortgages, credit card debt, no savings, and you're supporting your father?
i couldn't ask you to do that.
based on these figures, i'm afraid you'll need to declare bankruptcy... several times. just look at this projection.
mr. simpson, your intelligence profile indicates that you're too "stupid" to stick to a budget.
oh, i concur. word-a-day calendar.
hmmm. what is this? some kind of force-field around these vegetables.
everything's so green and alive!
what kind of a raise?
i don't want to hear your whining. i'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!
oh, for the love of... hurl this at that.
well, let's decorate him then.
not even for four dollars?
do it again! i'll make it an even eight.
let's keep the laughs coming, eh, simpson? what say i make you my executive in charge of recreation -- no, no, better yet, my prank monkey.
i can't have my little monkey running around in rags.
look at that comic book fellow calmly eating candy like a spaniard. time for monkey to shine.
oh, that was uproarious. first-rate job, monkey!
okay, now!
the line in the lady's room is far too long and so i hope you don't mind if i...
there. that's six years' worth of inoculations.
homie, where did you get that ball of money?
really? like what?
look at their proud, hopeful faces. wait'll they see that their rare chinese panda is nothing but a fat guy in a suit.
oh, she's saying "i love you."
hah. you ain't goin' nowhere, cutie.
dad?? the panda was you?
so, this is your mysterious new job for mr. burns?
oh dad, you have to stop.
too busy trying to keep my sides from splitting -- it's happened before. monty say, monkey do. what could be better?
oh, shut up, you tub of guts.
not my dad.
dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?
da-ad!
well, well, it looks like my monkey has evolved into a man. a poor man.
forget about him, dad. i'm proud of you.
well, there's lots of needy kids out there...
yessss?
why, i don't think i've ever seen such generosity. you're a modern-day kris kringle, sir.
say no more. i had a bit of a shoe-sniffing problem myself. i'm still not allowed on the third floor.
wanna rehearse, dad?
prepare to be boarded!
not for one million dollars?
oh, dad. you sold your soul.
what's going on?
or a quiet phone call.
why not? anything goes today.
hmmm, well, do you need a paperweight? because if you buy that machine, that's all you're gonna have. is an expensive paperweight.
mm-hm. that technology is three months old. only suckers buy out of date machines. you're not a sucker, are you, sir?
you'll need a top of the line machine for that. that's the same computer astronauts use to do their taxes.
of course you were.
you only have ten seconds to decide, sir.
dad, you shouldn't drag that around.
ah, you're busy. catch you later, compu-tater.
dad, i'll set up your computer. why don't you and bart go play in the back yard?
okay, you're ready to go. i've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them.
homer, bring that back in the house.
while you wait, why not buy a police cap or t-shirt? you have the right to remain fabulous!
i got suspended from school today.
i took a swing at a cop.
i'm just mad all the time.
you have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea...
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.
nelson.
you can't post that on the internet. you don't even know if it's true.
good lord! we've discovered the ruins of an ancient city! okay, you do better.
do you want turkey sausage or ham?
a new internet watchdog is creating a stir in springfield. mr. x, if that is his real name, has come up with a sensational scoop.
i'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. maybe you should quit while you're ahead.
the public should be warned. i wish mr. x were here.
are you him? are you mr. x?
uh, but you talked in that real sly voice. hey, hey, everybody, homer's mr. x!
are you?
no.
no.
oh, pshaw.
let go of me! i'm innocent!
he is mr. x! hah!
i'm proud that you won the pulitzer...
but i do feel bad about the starving children...
so hungry.
at least take off your pulitzer prize when you say that.
oh, dad...
hey, mr. x! i got a tip for ya. in science class, they're dissecting frozen hoboes. and i have the bindles to prove it.
this is... the island.
because you know something.
see you tomorrow.
i'm number 15. what number are you?
yes, well done.
i don't know.
hello, number 5. how's every little thing?
fair enough, i'll level with you. ow. please. don't do that.
i'll be blunt. your web page has stumbled upon our secret plan.
to drive people into a frenzy of shopping. that's why flu shots are given just before christmas.
yes it is. and we can't have you out there mucking it up now, can we?
there's a good boy. let's get you some ice cream. there you are.
i wouldn't count on that, number 5. as far as your family knows, homer simpson is walking in the front door right about now.
sorry, old chap. but you're proving quite the caterpillar in our buttermilk.
we're shutting you down.
that arranged can be.
yes, fight and struggle!
the dog thinks so, too.
once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place.
welcome to the magic palace.
hello, i'm questo. i'll be your waiter and mentalist for this evening. i'm receiving a drink order... something foamy... is it a beeee...?
cool! a gift shop. "ages 8 to 80." hmm... that's me! dad, will you get me this magic kit?
hmmm. well, there's your problem.
ooh, well, ah, that's a foreign fish we're lookin' at... so, uh, sixty-five hundred. plus three-fifty.
maybe i can make some money, dad. my magic act is really coming along.
oh, no! i could never support the black arts.
hey, you guys... you're in our spot!
dad, only one of them is real.
hey, don't blame me. i gotta compete with tv, and the internet.
well, i showed up for all your stupid interventions.
hey, homer! check it out!
yeah, i know a little place.
people. i guess they thought i was a charity case.
so in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe.
sounds good. wanna eat my fat?
this book has all the classic cons. there's "the pigeon drop," "the ear wigger," "the brillstein grab..."
well, there's the "albany ham scam."
should i just back out of the room?
okay, dad. ready for our first con?
nice use of the lingo, homer.
sir, it was my fault.
wow, look at all this loot! what should we buy first?
there you are. how was the magic act?
or so it would seem...
i just gotta get him back!... or if not him, a similar dog...
dad?
why are we still grifting? the car's paid for. doesn't that balance out the universe?
okay, i'm sold.
oh, no, homer, remember? maudie got called up to heaven.
why, there's my name in gold.
amateurs!
that's right.
yeah, in the depression, you had to grift. either that, or work.
i'm abe simpson.
i can't believe it! i can finally afford a young, crazy stripper wife. yeah, i'm gonna get me the craziest, strippiest...
oh, this is terrible. now who do we give the money to?
forget it, ed. do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head.
well, this is about the flashiest car i've ever impounded.
please, fbi man, don't throw us in jail. we just made one mistake.
hmm... okay, tell you what. i'll let you turn yourselves in. maybe they'll go easier on you.
well, i did ruin the boy's birthday cake. go on in. but i'll be watching.
that's not an fbi badge.
that guy was a grifter!
you were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
what did he look like?
oh, dear. we don't want that.
homie! homie, wake up! they've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!
i didna do it, i tell ya.
what do you care, loner?
dad, we've got to tell everyone the truth.
mr. simpson, could you describe your assailant to the court?
dad! tell them!
daa-ad!
wait a minute. this whole thing was a set-up?!
yeah, we hornswoggled you good.
he's doing "dreamcoat" at the dinner theater.
willie wasn't!
well, folks, he's got a point. uh, with all our unscripted horseplay, we sometimes don't think about...
yeah, they really hurt that guy's feelings.
ready for the circus, homer?
the cirque de purée. we've had tickets since septembre.
as french canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment.
but i cannot help you. i am just a local merchant from, uh... this town.
mesdames et messieurs, it appears the cloud goddess is ripe with rain babies. we must run for our trucks.
oh, stop. your father and i don't get the day off. lenny says we've got the day off! yippee!
well, i'm all for rescuing the kids, but i wish you hadn't sawed off my roof.
but it's my car.
sure you did -- "mr. plow." you're wearin' the jacket right now!
oh! i think we hit something.
stupid ice. i always knew i would die caked in something. well, better turn off that engine. before those fumes put us in tombs.
homer! wake up! the car's filling with...
just like the one that saved ezekiel!
now let's go save those kids.
gotcha!
and the exhaust pipe is leaking.
ignore her, effendi. we have each other.
i don't know what's in 'em. i just know i can't stop smokin' 'em. 
now, when we activate the suite, our furry friend will copy you exactly.
that would be the world's funniest marsupial.
uh, sir, this is a joint account. uh, you'll, need your wife's signature, too.
here's your candy.
okay... uh, now, before i execute this order, are you sure you understand the risks of stock ownership?
for automated stock prices, please state the company name.
animotion. up one and one-half.
yahoo. up six and a quarter.
turning to the stock market, animotion is up an eighth...
... after plunging seventy-five points this morning.
are you crazy?! i'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
you know, homer, i got a great way to make money -- i'm a human guinea pig.
ow! not so loud.
first, we'll test this experimental perfume on you.
homer, you really have no desire to eat that food?
he must've brought it in with him.
do you have any idea how this might have happened?
mr. simpson, this could be responsible for your subnormal intelligence.
we could remove the crayon for you. it could vastly increase your brain power... or it could possibly kill you.
oh, homer, where have you been?
do you feel smarter?
i don't believe it. say something else smart.
i'd love to go to the library with you.
dad, did you read all these books today?
oooh, found a new short cut?
welcome to the third lecture in our series on "not putting things up your nose." please welcome homer simpson.
question!
a moron says what?
whatcha mailin', homer?
how come you're not giving it to mr. burns?
yeah, it's nice to have someone with brains in this nuclear plant. homer's the guy who rigged up my pants with this special codpiece.
i can't feed my family with a codpiece.
don't tell me how to feel.
you ain't welcome here no more, smart boy.
dad, as intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. in fact, i made a graph. i make a lot of graphs.
oh, many things: tai chi, chai tea... but i find, when i can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk.
wait a minute! somebody's not laughing here. it's him!
... ably played by bill paxton.
point out your plot holes elsewhere!
i'm sorry. we don't play god here.
so whaddaya want here? uh, appendectomy, lipo, or the "sampler"? that's very popular.
all right, tell me when i hit the sweet spot.
all right, all right.
that's pretty dumb... but uh...
dad, how could you? we were connecting in such a meaningful way.
"lisa: i'm taking the coward's way out. but before i do, i just want you to know: being smart made me appreciate how amazing you really are." oh, dad.
homer, get up! up, up, up! oh no!
sorry, homie, but you promised to take me to the apron expo today.
no, "smapron."
and this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.
i'm a little disappointed. there were too many aprons.
somebody help him!
da-ad!
how's your back, homie?
naw, that's for the prisoners. you can complain all you want.
try to focus on something else. umm... you like jimi hendrix, right?
you kiddin'? look, he painted a unicorn in outer space. i'm askin' you, what's it breathin'?
ain't no air in space.
how's your back, dad?
oh, nothing... how would you feel if i did some volunteer work at the prison?
your spine is more twisted than sinbad's take on marriage.
oh, i'd love to. but, ah, to be honest, modern medicine has a lousy record of treating the back. we spend too much time on the front.
i'm gonna send you to my chiropractor.
hello, homer. i'm doctor steve. please lie down.
i'm just yankin' your chain. i'm jewish.
did you do those exercises he gave you?
dad! are you okay?
that trash can must have unkinked your back.
you remember jack... he's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
so, homer, you think you can fix my sciatica?
i'm limp. hey, it worked! my searing leg pain is now a gentle numbness.
simpson, you're not a licensed chiropractor. and you're stealing patients from me and dr. steffi!
careful, i'm frail.
excuse me, sir. is this el clínico magnífico?
we'd, uh, like to invest in your spinal adjustment device.
we'll need to take some photographs.
hey dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box.
i'll call poison control. fran, it's me. just a heads-up.
hey, where's my melon? and you are banned for life from all of my performances and tv specials.
ooh, it says here that special effects whiz tom savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!
how could you have it planned out? you just heard about the problem.
you two are not welcome.
thanks for the tip-off.
good evening. sorry... i-i had a really big dinner...
get out and take your sacajawea dollars with you. i'll give ya till "three." one... hey homer, who's the manatee?
nobody badmouths duff! uh, piece o' crap.
so many restaurants...
umm... i guess i'll, i'll have the chicken tandoori.
oh.
hmm. well, this autopsy coupon appears to be valid. what other funerary services may we provide for the pre-deceased?
sir, we prefer the term "casket" to "coffin." and "monument" to "tombstone." we have all the leading brands of anti-stink spray.
heh, heh, heh. look at 'im go.
ooh, bury me over here. pleeeease?
hear that? if you cheapskate me into hell, i'll haunt you good. imagine this when you're sittin' on the john:
o-kay, with mole insurance, your total comes to... seventeen thousand dollars.
or, you could just toss him in the woods and let the wolves carry him off. it's really up to you.
sir, if i may, think of it as an investment in extravagance. the mauso-palooza can be seen from space. it will consume as much cement as a regulation-size tennis court.
oh, i can't believe we went through all that, just to wind up with a tennis court.
you don't care what happens to me when i die.
practicing tennis.
you know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. i hear mel brooks has one. i mean, sir mel brooks.
and it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
hey, you got a tennis court.
will do.
match point.
that's game, set, and match to us. but the real winners here are marge's hors d'oeuvres.
i guess you could say, "i'm iraqi!"
especially bonnets.
hey, homer. here's a bloopie for ya.
you'll never guess what i heard in the supermarket today. i found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
i thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. instead, people make fun of our lousiness.
all of that is you. you've gotta take this more seriously.
what? we're not ready to compete!
get 'em off! get 'em off!
oh, that's okay. bart's doing fine. you just have another beer.
i don't know what this has to do with the civil war.
i am playing in the tournament.
i've got a partner.
oh, hello, homer.
uh, there's something i should tell you.
i'm bart's partner.
oh, i'm sorry, homie. we'll talk about it later, okay?
oh, homey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings.
i just wanted to win for once. please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. you remember the story of oedipus, don't you?
oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
i'm just saying you feel threatened by bart, but it's all in your head.
dad, i think you're overreacting.
goodbye.
are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?
and you're not doing it out of spite?
dad, i don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt mom.
oh, you little-- come on, bart.
telegram for lisa simpson.
dear lisa. psych. psych, psych, psych. signed, super-psych.
huh? ehh, whaddaya want? i'm not gonna do "a" material for charity. and after all, that is why we're here.
all we can do is play our very best.
now i'd like to introduce two of the tennis world's most unbeatable players, venus and serena williams.
that's our dad's seat.
you're dumping your own daughter?
our next match is marge and bart simpson...
...versus homer and lisa...
venus simpson? you're replacing me?
yes! i'm in.
you're andre. i'm serena.
me neither. i'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
after the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner.
i can't believe krusty's retiring. this is tragic!
i was at the flower shop.
thank you, folks. now, fasten your funny belts, as our own chimpendale's dancer gives you the full monkey!
time to blow up the clown...
and in 1984, portugal's carlos lopez becomes the oldest olympic marathon winner ever at age 38.
you got all your equipment, dad?
attention, runners. on your mark, get set, now get outta here before i change my mind.
well, thank you for lettin' me chill in your crib.
please, mom. my dream is to be a rock star.
don't be selfish, lisa.
what does it mean?
are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
cut it out! you're a grown man!
defuse it old school!
they called me "smelson"! haw haw.
are you sick of ordinary-shaped amusement parks?
it was all right, i guess.
squaresville sounds pretty cool.
come with me.
but you made it out of ham cubes.
hey, boat twenty-eight, stop splashing!
what kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
i'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
yaaayy!
hey, tough luck, pal. you can't fight the souvenir industry. we're too powerful.
great!
you idiot. they were beating out my shirt fire!
thanks again, dad.
bart's got a problem!
tommy.
they wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
yes, may i help you?
why are you doing zese things?
you see? zees is what i'm...
but we must have it. it is ze lifeblood of ze industry.
oh, homie, i love them. i can't thank you enough.
i tried to return my season ticket, but they wouldn't give me my money back. they said they wanted it.
that's where we keep the water heater.
that's a tractor.
sir, we can't give your friend a refund just because the team is losing.
spin that back to where it was.
no. i don't. get out of here. no, no, not that door!
it's not anything. it has no purpose.
no, no. there's no 'ohhhh.'
no, no, we would never abandon our loyal springfield fans. by the way, all this barging into rooms marked "private" must have made you thirsty. would you like a beer?
good grief.
all night. you were yelling at the swing.
dad, you were nuts.
he's right, folks. the only story here is the rich, smooth taste of duff.
there's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. bob dylan wrote songs. cesar chavez staged hunger strikes.
oh, homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. you eat while you brush your teeth. you're eating a huge sausage right now.
you're really not gonna eat anything?
dad, i'm so proud of you. if you need some inspiration, here's a book of mike farrell's core beliefs.
stop calling me that.
liars?
yeah!
oh, seymour!
yeah, duck man! over here!
the spirit of cesar chavez.
because you don't know what cesar chavez looks like.
to tell you not to give up.
well, homer. your hunger strike lasted twelve amazing days.
of course you are, hungry hungry homer. so why not break your fast with our brand new isotope dog supreme?
now, now, now, now see here, people... let's not be too hasty.
get him out of here.
that ad campaign may have crossed a line.
homer, you're still here? you should've left for work an hour ago!
yep. it's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?
yeah. the uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
no, i got it!
springfield baby-proofing?
dead tired of baby-proofers who don't provide a free estimate. let's start in the kitchen. now, pretend i'm a baby. goo goo. me wike to expwore.
you see how quickly your baby could've been drinking this... similac baby formula.
that's the price of the clipboard. here's your estimate.
she's not afraid of bunnies.
no, no, no. oh, homie!
i'm the one who told you that.
isn't that a little excessive? i mean, how are the buttons dangerous?
i'm a horrible mother.
oh, thank you. no more shiva-related pokings.
but we are hindu.
the safe-baby craze. it's sweeping springfield, thanks to one crusading parent.
the dream is over. shut her down, boys.
i have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. i call it "poindextrose".
oh, honey, we're so proud of you.
someone's gonna sleep well tonight.
i need this candy for school. candy class.
my teacher said i need cupcakes. cupcakes to learn.
i'm out of wine.
in the cart.
sir, please. i've already bagged it by color, and in order of each item's discovery by man.
hey, hey, watch what you're doin' there, sack monkey. you're bruisin' my duralog.
please. ow. stop. bag boys have feelings, too, you know.
strike! strike! strike!
mr. simpson, please. will you go home?
hey, the dog smells something!
homer, no! those were made in the sixties.
we make household poisons and christmas lights.
sir, with all due respect... an old box of cookies is not a legal contract.
sharp corners... mr. simpson, we've decided to make good on your vacation.
uh, yes?
i will come down for your bags.
ooh, look, everybody!
wait, rhinos don't come from eggs.
i know, but...
this is the earliest known fossil of a human being. it's over two million years old.
it's not the number of bones, sir, it's the...
oh, thank you. your ground is so comfortable.
this song has been going on for hours.
the left! go to the left!
wonder where this river goes.
oh, no! we're headed for victoria falls!
oh, no! it's eating us!
are we insane yet? are we insane yet? are we insane yet?
mount kilimanjaro?
hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas.
thank you. see, jojo, she likes it.
every day i get up at five-thirty, watch the chimps, eat a quick lunch of roots and water, then more chimp-watching. after dark i come home and think about chimps until it's time for bed.
possibly, but...
absolutely not! will you help me defend the refuge?
yes! 
buzz off.
hm, quite a promotion.
/ oh, he got overthrown!
breakfast!
meet linguo, the grammar robot. i built him all by myself. if you misuse language, he'll correct you.
i love beer.
this is why i can't have nice things.
they're for after dinner.
no!
stop it!
homer!
i'm sorry! i'm so sorry!
123 fake street. got it.
...and harry potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft. what the diddly-yo?!
we've gotta get to the hospital, homer!
homer, help!
well, i could cut off the other thumb for a sense of symmetry.
no problem. just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle brine. that'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
hey, ah, hey, ain't you gonna have a beer?
inflammable means flammable? what a country!
i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?
dad, no!
hang on, linguo. you'll be up and conjugating in no time.
my bad. i can't work my answering machine either. now i need a new informant. say, lisa, people trust you. how'd you like to be a snitch? the pay stinks, but-- oh.
hey, somebody done stoleded my wheels.
bad grammar overload. error! error!
it's all right, boys.
exactly.
thank you, homer.
it says i have cooties.
that was great. i can't believe she found a rhyme for hezekiah.
eh, they'll all go to hell. say how's your life going?
i can hear her, homer.
okay, well maybe another time. you know, i better go check into my hotel.
oh, who am i kidding? i'm not over maude at all.
always do.
homer, don't you have any respect?
wow, three pairs of shoes. someone had a fetish.
kinda.
you said we were doing this out of friendship.
you're right. maude designed a christian amusement park. oh, it must have been her final dream.
oh, bless you, sir. ah, gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene.
are you nuts?
darn teenagers with their beer bottles.
ohhh, i'm not very good at begging people for stuff.
well thanks, homer.
you can have these, ah, fireworks i confiscated. some chinese people claimed they were celebrating new year's in february.
this sawdust will soak up the puke from the rooller-cooster. it's willie's special blend.
homer, no! i can't exploit a divine manifestation.
oh, there's no explaining god's will, roddy. that's like explaining how an airplane flies.
you better stick your head in and see what's going on.
hello, gas company? how poisonous is your gas?... wow. but-- eh, but i'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... how could that be worse?... okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... i see. i've gotta close praiseland down. someone could get hurt.
hey, ned! i just read about your park in that horrible triple-a magazine.
i'm sure. so, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?
i know. we'll never see any of you again.
my turn, huh? let's see...
mm-hm.
willie tickles the twine for two! oi! oi!
oh my goodness, an untied shoelace. i'll just get down on one knee and retie that.
homer, i'm afraid you've torn out your anterior cruciate ligament.
it happened today.
you go, homer!
we've got to get you into surgery.
oh, he fell off the gurney. but it will take plenty of time and rehab before you can go back to work.
now homer, i want you to stay off that leg for two weeks.
now, homer, there are people right through that door that have it much worse than you.
so, the tables have turned. now you're the shut-in and i'm the hip, young dude. there goes my wagging finger.
hey, homer!
would you mind watching the kids? i'm kinda in a pickle here.
mr. simpson, can we have another jelly and candy sandwich?
daddy said it's rude to call grownups by their first name.
pokémon? pokémon? with the pokey and the mon and the...
well, sir, i never heard a preacher use the "m-f" word so many times. anyway, thanks again.
oh, roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center.
so you are running a day care center?
well, i sure would. it would give the boys a place to go after school.
is your knee really gross under there?
can i touch it?
it's healing over my hand.
yes, whatever, just take them!
ah, yes. how is your day care center doing?
i've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
uncle homer, will you sing that crazy song we love?
yeah. hey, homer, i thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better.
i contributed by not objecting too much.
anyway, this film crew... will shoot some behind-the-scenes footage of your amazing work.
it's already set up.
we're just restin' our eyes.
tell me about the "homer cares" program.
awww. did you make 'em yourself?
this year's winner of the "saint who walks among us" award...
... homer simpson!
three nines.
come to new papa.
we just spliced in some home movies. whaddaya think?
my polite indignation has no bounds.
where are we going, mr. simpson?
then you better turn.
yeah. / pretty much.
the teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
you're next, mr. simpson.
sir, it's a standard fee.
mornin', folks.
well, i s'pose i could spin ya a few more yarns... but first, who wants to give me a sponge bath? i'm filthy.
dad, you just killed a poor, defenseless buffalo!
she even changed her last name to "appleseed." and her family changed theirs to "buffelkill."
the buffalo are gone. i think you shot them all.
yeah, i suppose you could grind some pills into it.
and that was tom and huck's last adventure.
i believe i told three stories.
you know, i do four hundred sit-ups a day.
oh, not at all. i like when people say nice things about my body.
okay. i sense you live with much misery.
i sense i should not take a check.
get out.
wait a minute. this isn't cedars sinai. you've ruined me! oh, why didn't i see this coming?
gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens.
yeah, but a lot harder to catch. uh, go with the leprechaun.
well, okay, but hurry up.
...ya big fat ass!
ah, the cursed one. how's that curse i cursed you with, cursed-y , hm?
hold me close... kiss me i'm irish...
the best thing about a gypsy wedding is i'm not the hairiest woman here.
what? bart is dead!
dinner is served.
bravo, pierce!
uh-huh. absolutely. / yep. /
oh, oh. oh dear me. oh yesss. yum, yum, yum. homer, my dear fellow. you're carrying quite a bit of tension in your back fat, homer.
point one five.
you know, marge is quite a remarkable woman.
you're certainly a lucky man to have her.
machine, eh?
dad, that's the water softener!
homer, no!
oh, how magical!
she'll be killed!
oh-ho-ho. if our wampum wagon spots your kbbl party penguin, you'll win forty dollars!
hey, there's the wampum wagon!
yes they are, roy.
on the other hand, i was young once.
according to this, your father was driving you to school? then where was he when you stole the police car?
you abandoned your son to win forty dollars?
and that was more important than keeping your son out of trouble?
i'm familiar with b.o.c. but you have got a boy here who is crying out for adult supervision.
i hereby order you to be tethered to your son.
tethered. report to room five.
there we go. how's that?
sir, you are not a size four.
today we're going to talk about predicates and predicate nominatives.
mr. simpson, i'm trying to teach.
will you please just go back to sleep?
night terrors, ma'am.
wow, my first home run.
can i ask you something, dad?
the town keeps getting bigger. will there always be enough electricity?
uh, i don't think lenny's house has a steeple.
one beer, comin' up. hey, hey. no kids in the bar.
oh, the heat's been on since them bush girls were in here.
i'm cold and scared.
c'mon, dad. let's go.
all right. hand 'em over.
there's a new judge in town with a hard-nosed approach to juvenile crime: punish the parents.
granted. but you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for bart. he might even make the honor roll, if dad can control his night terrors.
c'mon, dad. i gotta go to the bathroom.
homer, just take him to the bathroom.
would you mind? i'm trying to do my homework.
oh, homie, no. we can't.
i don't want him to see us expressing our love.
the lady said no.
you shut up.
what'd you do that for?
ah!
that's right. it's me, judge harm, through the magic of fiber optics.
quiet, tubsy. you violated my order.
no!
quiet, little girl. you two need to wake up and smell the java. and the first step is to admit that you're bad parents.
just, just let me get-- 
not yet. no. today the judge wants you to bend over so people can spank you from their cars.
i just can't do that, homer. it's a matter of principle. and i need you to support me in this.
i want goggles, too.
you're using my table saw to violate a court order?
gee, i always like to help you, homer, but i don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. and it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as...
if that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious.
concentrate, homer.
we hate her, homer.
let's do this thing.
get away from that window! and help me with this banner.
let's get out of here. 
homer, no!
my house!
that quilt was made by my grandmother.
we promise.
what are you reading, homie?
that's odd. he's outside, digging.
there's no drugs out there.
yep.
go for it.
what's stopping you?
but morlocks are from the future.
yeah. how'd you know the chinese were spyin' on ya?
you take that back.
but, can you blame me? every day it's the same old routine. i serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and i never get one stinkin' tip.
ah, who am i kiddin'? i ain't smiled for real since i nailed that rat with the ice pick. ha, remember that?
ahh! how did i lose my passion for the job? when i was in bartending school, i thought i had the world by the jigger.
... and if anybody wants potato chips or anything fancy, tell 'em to go to hell.
hey, what are you doin'? i gotta pay for that!
all right, look, i-i gotta go.
hey homer, do you mind if i bring in some outside food?
hey, what happened to the music?
are you gonna be okay?
just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger.
yell out "i'll eat a booger."
hey, homer stop, stop! it's me! geez.
my professor said if i prettied up this dump, it would renew my zeal.
i am formico. the dean of design.
ah, ah, ah! my name must never be spoken.
wow, check out the new moe's.
uh, looks like a long wait to get in.
hoy. hoy! is your name on the list?
it's okay, cecil. they're vips.
ain't it trippy?
we don't serve duff no more. we got a malaysian beer that's better than duff... it's made outta soy sauce.
models?! ha. oh boy!
i'm trapped! this is creative design run amok!
eh, you'd be having a great time if you'd stayed in your dark spot.
is it? oh, well that's it. that's-- dagmar, julian, throw this bum out.
whatcha doin', dad?
this is pretty far to go just to spite moe.
i won't drink at moe's / homer's old garage is all i ne-ed / i won't drink at moe's...
that calls for another beer.
i thought this was gonna be your bar.
can we go to bed now?
how'd you get rem to play in your garage?
what the-- you can't open your own bar!
but it's illegal! you can't run a bar in a private residence.
ah, here we go. it also says, "a licensed hunting club must actively engage in the sport of hunting."
it's not fair, dad. why should an animal die just because you and moe are fighting?
do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
you do? then i like you, too. here, have a towelette.
you did it, moe!
dad, you shot moe!
exactly.
aw, i'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have thanksgiving dinner together in this bar.
i did. you owe rem an apology for, eco-fraud.
ah, here you go, pal.
fortune cookie.
oh... fortune means: geese cause problems.
every house has a bathroom.
well, with all due respect, sir, i suppose you could come up with better fortunes?
well?
this gentleman here can write better fortunes than all of you put together. show them.
i'm sorry, monty...
tell my young sweetheart here of our youthful exploits.
play along, chubsy. there's a pie in it for you.
well...
well done, young man. your youthful trendiness will come in handy throughout the courting process. because these days... where did you get that pie?
well, don't look too hip. you don't want that girl falling for you.
d-- oh, uh, constantly. when we're not being kicked out for our rowdy, youthful behavior! eh, pally?
put my hand on her knee.
i said her. and i said knee.
all right, you're dismissed. i'll take it from here.
did you hear that? that "excellent" was... excellent.
in time, in time. i need to speak with you in private. back in a moment, my dear. we have to, uh... uh... expel some urine.
isn't it wonderful? i'm head over heels in love.
no! i'm engaged now! my ring!
uh-un.
don't say that, baby. i'm gonna win you back if i have to pistol whip this guy all night.
let me guess. now you're going to start working him over with the brass knuckles. you are so predictable.
i don't like bothering people at home.
i know you've been through a lot, ma'am, but we need you to stand in front of the burning house and say "channel 6 is hot, hot, hot."
never forget, homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart.
i don't get it, simpson. i'm a bad boy.
spill it... ooo, burly, you're insatiable. burly. you're so rugged and manly...
fantasize, marge. fantasize about burly.
"dear burly, comma, i've never written to a registered trademark before. are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? in either case, i would love a signed photo. sincerely, marge simpson."
person-to-person?!
oh, my goodness...
playing a prankeroo, eh?
you're not going to believe it. that paper towel lumberjack is coming here! for dinner! tonight!
i will! 
now you've done it. you really humiliated mom.
i suggest dinner and a show.
i guess it was a pretty funny prank. i like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
hey, smart move, four-eyes. sittin' next to skeletor here makes you look like hercules.
when i snap my fingers, you will transform into... a... famous historian.
thank you. now you are... emily dickinson.
now, you are a young boy... ah, yourself, at twelve years old...
ah, yes, yes. um...
no dad, everyone's sick of that memory! try to remember back when you were twelve. something frightening must have happened.
and there's your whatchamacall repressed trauma. i mean, who likes getting muddy? it's terrible. okay, let's go to moe's now.
fine. crap all over my theory.
you found a corpse when you were twelve? no wonder you've been so traumatized.
oh... oh, okay. well, uh, i'll see ya.
stop saying that, dad.
maybe we should come back in the daytime.
if there's a body in here, we'll drag it up. ah heck, it's just an old shopping cart.
but i did not murder him. and i can prove it... with this film.
ha, busted!
homer, shouldn't we give that skull to mr. smithers?
oh. well, you wanna take a look at it anyways, uh just for ha-has?
you know it is.
hey dad, will you help me build this model rocket?
i didn't know your dad was so interested in science.
uh, he didn't say science... he said "pie pants."
wow, did you see that yaw control?
well, then, could you stop calling us nerds?
oh, that's sensible.
dad, the rocket's off course!
this is the worst thing you've ever done.
why does jesus have a lasso?
that's it!
oh no...
mom, dad, my spiritual quest is over...
i'm a buddhist.
time to begin operation xmas-remind of-how good is. just do it. do it. do it now!
well, santa can take it back because i'm not ruled by material desi-- is that a pony?
yeah, i wanted to spend christmas with you guys.
uh huh.
oh. we'd better stay inside. at least until the squirrels stop melting.
he smelled like puke!
that's it, baby. welcome to marvin gardens.
you're a little light here, dad.
well, i'd like to trust you, homer. but you've been in jail three times.
who else is gonna take care of her? dad?
heh. too bad real women don't come with these, huh? 
take it back! take it back!
hello, i'm gabriel.
no, that's my pager. i'm a social worker. i'm here to help you stop fighting and become a family again.
homer, i am not an angel!
homer, your problem is quite simple. you're a drunken, childish buffoon.
it's your fault, homer. but i've got an exercise that will help all of you break out of the roles you're stuck in. who feels like lunch?
you'll just have to cooperate.
we've got to do something, but what?
look, we can't fall into old patterns. we've gotta think of a plan.
fine, i'll talk like this.
give them the food!
we are family!
well, i think you all did great. you broke out of your normal roles to accomplish something as a family. i've really earned my wings.
you know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger.
homer and ned, you may now kiss your brides.
you and ned married a couple floozies?
if i had known there were loose women in las vegas, i would never have let you go.
get out, homer.
now, now, momma's gonna make you a snack.
why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
bigamy.
you insensitive jerk! maybe this family would be better off without you!
why don't you just take britney beers and get outta here!
gee, homer. your new wife is great. her lips look like night-crawlers.
wowww.
oh, sure. he paid for the hour.
why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
it was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.
all right. outside.
wow, that's the best book i've ever seen!
francis of assisi .
only on mars.
three years.
uh, technically, the cobra would get the record. he's the one playing.
mr. simpson, there are thousands of people like you with no discernible talent.
all the individual records were set by crackpots who half-killed themselves. the only way someone new can get in the book is with some kind of group stunt.
like that town that made the world's largest omelet.
/ what's he talking about?
i haven't seen this much flesh since elke sommers' hot-tub party. seriously, elke's great. always there for sick kids. doin' great things.
everyone, welcome to the duff book of world records: springfield is the world's fattest town!
haw haw.
you kids do eat a lot of sugar. but at least homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit.
if you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture.
what are you talking about? is that dinner?
why didn't you just turn off the oven?
silence! i rule in favor of marge simpson.
and, thanks to marge's simpson's damning evidence... i hereby ban all sugar products from springfield -- forever!
mr. simpson, you are licking blood and vapo-rub.
there is a small group committed to bringing sugar back to this town. by any means necessary.
gentlemen, i have found the final member of our cabal.
homer, we need you to help us smuggle in sugar from south of the border.
get a grip, simpson. you're doing fine. now, do you have your map?
okay man, there's the sugar. now you give us the money.
well, we're almost home.
hold it right there. surrender or prepare to be sunk.
yeah.
good work, simpson.
oh, all right. but take maggie with you. mm. i guess you just can't use the law to nag. maybe i should just stop trying to change the world.
that's the best one!
uh-oh, the professor said not to let him get a boner.
homer, you're going to get in trouble.
litter is my most treacherous foe. i would like to eat its children.
homer, you've suffered a broken jaw.
mm, thank you. this has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
homer, your breath smells terrible. i'll have to take off my shoes to cover the odor.
hello? yeah, i'd like to arrange for an escort please. to where? how 'bout "orgasmville"? hello? hello? uh, hey, how ya doin'?
i'm an alcoholic. homer, will you appear on my show?
he did such crazy things -- roll clip.
i'll take one.
do you promise not to wevive your weckless, weckless ways?
please, homie? no more craziness -- for me?
we're rehearsing a play.
well, i'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
this place is so dull. the nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
it's seven-thirty!
dad, you've gotta do something.
she could get hurt!
so many dings. 
a man on a donkey! never in my six weeks on the job have i seen the likes of this.
ooooh.
let's approach with caution!
pretty much. yeah.
oho! trouble in paradise.
yes, i do have everything. but yet i often wonder what life with marge would have been like.
homer, i will give you one million dollars to let me spend a weekend alone with your wife.
what?
no way, no how! i'll get used to the snoring, just like i got used to saying "courtney cox-arquette". besides, i like some of the noises you make in bed.
are you snoring while you're awake?
and you get more sprawl space on the bed.
yeah, i can't get artie out of my head. he's like a spy in the house of moe.
you're not on the guest list, simpson. orders of prom king ziff. and have you been drinking?
ah, well if it makes you feel any better, he's probably doin' her right now. oh yeah, make me the bad guy.
sounds like a plan.
marge, if you're watching this, then it means i've figured out how to work the camera. last night i crashed a certain fake prom. that's right, artie ziff's fake prom. homer was there?
but i can explain!
i'll put you on rig thirteen, as soon as they burn off the corpses.
looks like we're goners. oh well, circle of life.
ain't ya comin', homer?
but, homer...
we can't take his money.
and our marriage, with his latest invention -- the snore converter. goodnight, homie.
for god's sake, homer. give them back their flame!
you can always find your favorite shows next month.
hello, and thank you for coming to our fund-raiser. i'm headmaster st. john van hookstratten.
monkeys point.
no, i belong here! pleeeaaase!
i will not be a gamecock!
it's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.
that car's as big as all outdoors.
homer, i see your daughter is one of those whale-kissing, dukakis-hugging moon maidens.
i just want my daughter to be happy. plus you eat the pretzels i drop on the floor.
oh, that's just lara flynn boyle.
and where were you?
...so to win greta back, i have to go to toronto.
maggie, what do you think?
oh, you'll win her back, eh. and b, we're closing in five minutes.
the geek shall inherit the earth.
i don't know, dad. what if she's still mad at me?
but she might say no.
a crazy dog's trying to kill me!
so bart, when does the killing start?
i guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
buck gave it to me. he's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. i wanna grow up to be just like him.
aw, homie, you'll always be my western hero.
i can't wait till i get good. buck's here! dad, why are you wearing that?
gee buck, your old films are as violent as today's!
sir you cannot pee / unless you are an employee...
he's drunk!
did i forget to mention i'm an alcoholic?
that is just grotesque.
eh, we could try it.
i'm sorry i let your son down, but i'm too old to change. seventy-six.
buck, if you walk out that door, you'll be branded a quitter forever.
ah, please, everyone, stay away. we don't want anyone to be a hero. a hero. a hero!
are you crazy? i'm a movie cowboy. and you're no howard hawks.
buck, you're my hero again.
well, there's krusty, itchy, scratchy, poochie, america's firefighters and then you, dad.
honey, i've got some bad news for you.
honey...
homer, your father's dead!
it's grampa's smell. "old old spice."
but you were very open with your feelings.
me? i ain't dead. it was stimson down the hall. so much for mister "i can button my own shirt."
b-6.
this game makes no sense.
i wanna drive again!
well, you're no angel behind the wheel. what about your d.u.i.?
fine, i'm dead.
woo hoo! and i want driving gloves!
what's the scoop, milkshakes? i got me a date with zelda, so i need the car.
why don't we double date? then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
dude sure got his comeuppance.
oh, zelda.
oh, everybody trusts lisa. precious little lisa, apple of her daddy's eye.
grampa, i gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie.
he used to be such an angel. maybe you should give him another chance.
he is your dad.
death race?
first he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. your father's out of control.
yay!
now, i'd like my son to come up here. son, can you forgive an old fool?
bill... bill... bill. homer, you got a letter. hm. it's from the library.
here's the book... "classics for children?"
no dad. it's an epic tale from ancient greece.
dad, i loved it, too, but it was seven years ago.
hi-o-diddily-ysseus!
i'll say. i'd really like to go out and get the mail.
odysseus, do not forget to thank the gods for our victory with an appropriate animal sacrifice.
you gonna be askin' that the whole trip?
the feta is cheesy / the sirens are easy...
oh, where could your father be?
didn't you eat enough of your friends?
yes, i've been saying that for hours.
you're my la-dy / of the mor-ning... /
this is the face that launched a thousand ships. the other way!
brave odysseus, it has been twenty long years. regale me with tales of your adventures.
it's never joan van ark.
victory.
don't burn her! she's just an innocent child!
cool. does he get to marry his mom?
could that fat ghost be telling the truth? first i've got to get uncle claudius to confess, then i've gotta kill him.
are you crazy? i can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
now that's what i call a "moon shot."
our phone bill is four hundred dollars! they charged us for a call to brazil.
no sir, i didn't.
homer! they must have made a mistake. we'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
we've been charged for calls to brazil that we didn't make.
homer!
why must you fight with every utility?
homer, we were cleaning out a cooling duct at the plant and found a box of old taco shells!
oh we tried. but a recording said you were a bunch of deadbeats.
what call to brazil?
you made that call? but you're the good one.
oh, aren't you sweet? sharing your allowance with a poor brazilian boy.
he's so adorable. can we have another baby?
not if we buy our tickets on the internet. it's really cheap if we change planes in phoenix, honolulu, sun city, and east st. louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now.
except antarctica.
okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer.
that's right.
no dad, it's just the weather.
yes.
ay caramba, que mujer tonta! veinte horas estudiar por nada!
look, it's the giant statue of christ on corcovado.
boy, they sure love soccer here.
how to loot brazil?
look, the room came with a fruit hat.
i'm chiquita banana / and i'm here to say...
yeah, check out the rats.
we're never gonna find him.
we nuns cannot fly.
you know i'm a vegetarian.
ah, si?
excuse me, americans...
i feel so european.
here you go.
my american friend, i'm afraid that this is a kidnapping.
i suppose.
i'm afraid you don't appreciate the seriousness of the situation.
all right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?
that's baby corn.
i gotta admit, i-i'm kinda nervous, here. we haven't seen barney since they enveloped him.
homer, i'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom.
i'm sleeping on the couch.
caw! caw! caw!
don't be mad at the crows, homer. they weren't trying to blind you. they were just trying to drink your sweet, sweet eye juices.
well, there is a medication, although it's a little... controversial.
i'm talkin' about medicinal marijuana. prescription pot. texas t-h-c.
smell any drugs, sgt. scraps?
but homer, you can't let a single bad experience scare you away from drugs.
it smells like the art teacher's office.
homer, you're doing drugs! and now i'm guilty of possession! i could go to prison! unless i testify against you...
honey, i like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. hang on, i've got call waiting. hello?
dad, i thought you didn't like her saxophone.
dad, it's one a.m. and i'm out of saliva.
hidilly-hey, homer!
well, sir, of course he could... but then again... wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle.
well, luckily, i've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers.
i guess that could be arranged. ...the grace of the lord jesus be with god's people. the end.
well, i know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana.
i told you, i pissed it away. oh, don't make that face. yes, that's the one! smithers, i need someone who laughs at all my jokes. you know, honest feedback.
well, you're a happy homer. what's your name, young man?
oh smithers, i would have said anything to get your stem cells. now, welcome aboard.
where did you get that suit?
you mutton heads, this is why we can never hold down a job!
whoa-ho-ho-ho. hey, "shemp" is "hemp" spelled backwards.
homie, i don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?
this just in: the marijuana re-criminalization initiative took another step forward today as supporters collected the final signatures required to place it on the ballot for next tuesday's election.
/ jobs? / what?
/ yes! yes!
what are we gonna do?
homie, you don't need drugs anymore. your eyes are all better.
as long as you're doin' things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house.
yeah, i can still crash here, right?
remember when i dropped my keys and, and you thought the phone was ringin'?
what's the matter, homer? you're drunk but you're not like sloppy drunk.
why are you keeping that thing?
ahoy-hoy, executive v.p. i'm putting the final touches on my speech to the investors and i need your generous guffaws.
oh, i'm drenched with sweat. i'm going to take a bathiola. when i come back, you'd better be laughing.
this suit used to belong to judy garland. ah, we could sing a song if you don't mind being mickey rooney.
the investors' meeting is in twenty minutes.
mr. burns, a two-part question: one, when will you see a profit again? and two, what's that red stuff coming out of your ear?
yes, i regained consciousness during my big dance number. those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber.
what are you doing here anyway?
wow, tell me some more.
now, where were we?
yeah. hop in, homer.
now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on.
no, it's me, krusty. and you're at the springfield friars club! where tonight we're roasting you, homer simpson!
hell no.
excellent.
now everyone knows homer loves his family...
hm, all i need is one classic character...
hey...
don't you hate carpet stores that charge extra for the under-padding?
oh, what a day. maybe the headlines will cheer me up. that's opinion, not news!
you heard the freak!
how'd you like to be played by john goodman?
dad, i'm no fan of bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger.
no, you're angry. look, you're punching the cat right now.
if you ask me, you should give up fatty foods.
did it again! hm. where in the hell is that soothing music coming from? homer? what's going on?
come on, angry dad. get angry! don't make me do a clip show!
okay.
you're not welcome.
ha, ha, you love a boy.
clean up in all the aisles. welcome, steady customer. i see you are ready for the civil war reenactment.
here you go.
the squishee lady!
go ahead.
take a penny, leave a penny. hey, she called me handsome!
come on, guys. we're gonna be late.
hey, you're right. i was afraid it would start me drinking again, but it didn't.
the south will boogie again!
ah, well, then, you're definitely not going to like my steam-powered super spider! with the stepping and the squishing and the webs made of ny-lon! oh the ny-lon has been released.
are you sure you can get your deposit back? it's in pretty bad shape.
how did you find out?
no, no, no, let's just keep playing. what's the score?
we have to do something to save that marriage. maybe i should just tell manjula. or you could talk to apu...
what would that accomplish?
i know, i know, there will be forty-seven bottles of beer on the wall. yes. homer, you did not bring me here for this. what is it that you want to tell me?
is there something you want to tell me?
it's true. it only happened once, but i am so ashamed. i am scum.
oh, i always thought karma was baloney, but not anymore.
i just wish there was something we could do... oh. oh, homer, are you thinking what i'm thinking?
you can run, but you can't glide!
tonight, we invite both manjula and apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming.
i keep telling you. off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. but if we remind apu and manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems.
hey pally, uh... where do you want the fudge mahal?
i know a great nametag place. they do fabulous work.
well, we had fun.
ooh, a challenge!
not bad, eh?
eliza, where the devil are my slippers?
"my fair lady," performed with all-octuplet cast... done.
thank you very much, you big fat blabbermouth. i-- sorry, sorry, it's been a rough month.
my little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.
i'm more than okay!... ich bin ein... gymnast!
whoa! party house.
duh.
doogie howser went to college when he was my age.
i put those "cathys" on the fridge for you. i don't even like them. they've gotten so smutty.
homer, cathy is a woman.
what are you doing?
oh, i cannot listen to this again.
yeah, you must be some kind of marriage super-genius. how 'bout a few tips?
oh, i can't wait to see my surprise!
that caterpillar is screaming.
"screamapillar care tips." wow, look at all this stuff. "without constant reassurance, it will die. it's sexually attracted to fire..."
what does he want now?
put him down, boy! put him down!
why don't i hear any screaming?
didn't these meals used to have a cobbler?
you smell like cobbler.
oh, don't be such a nervous purvis. that's not a real skeleton, it's a halloween costume.
oh, don't be silly. i just use that to chop through those tough meals-on-wheels steaks. oh, i couldn't possibly eat all this. please join me.
before you go, would you mind opening this jar of butter pickles?
oh my, you're as strong as you are handsome.
aren't you a wonder! can i call you the next time i need a muscular he-man?
freshen your drinks, ladies?
that man took my diamond necklace.
oh my gosh, she's dead.
so let me get this straight. this mysterious "man with braces" just stabbed the old lady and disappeared?
i found her will, chief. it was just changed to leave the simpsons fifty thousand dollars.
no, nah, it never does.
yeah, if dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?
well, we've all got that voice in our heads telling us to kill. you just have to drown it out. i've been working on the railroad / all the live long day... yeah, that's better.
right away, sir. i-i-i don't want no trouble.
go away! wait, wait! that's a suggestion, not a threat! homer!
i insist on searching every inch of this home personally.
oh homer, what are we going to do?
i can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
i'm also your host. now let's meet a ghost!
it's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
homie, i'm sorry. i can't. i just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. the kids growing up, grandchildren...
my love. you saved my life.
you're on "frame-up"!
only me, carmen electra!
frame up is fox's latest hit! right after "no pants island" and "fart date."
we were in the green room. i had so much shrimp!
hey hey! hey hey! hey hey! hey hey! hey...
dad, no. we're trying to conserve energy.
jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell ro...
dad, it's a blackout.
what if i just burn down a...
can't i at least incite further...
can i have a beer?
i don't care what they say. i won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.
homer, this is all your fault. if you hadn't plugged in your dancing santa, none of this would have happened.
mom, dad, someone stole my malibu stacy collection!
oh, forget it. they couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing.
dad, that's bart.
yeah.
maybe.
dude... i need a new cap.
i think they demean women.
well, you'll be happy to know malibu stacey's fine. i really appreciate what you did, dad.
you said you'd do something, and you followed through on it.
oh, that's it.
homer, you are so brave. if anyone deserves to take a penny, it is you.
well, who would my partner be?
him? no way!
well, nice work, inspector find-it. did you catch the thief?
well, i sure didn't.
a monster!
help me, springshield!
friend?
that commercial is very effective.
homie, to honor springfield's newest hero, i made you your favorite dinner. all three courses are dessert.
you can let me go, but i'll just keep exposing myself at the mall.
dad, make him stop!
hurry up, boys. we gotta get these "toy poodles" to the pet shop.
i'm with you, homer.
sorry homer. i'm a coward now, like all recovering alcoholics.
homie, please. why don't you just leave town?
we could come with you.
any last words, simpson?
oh homie, i'm so glad you're alive!
well then, who shot all the gangsters?
hm. time to check in on our little sweetie pie.
i've got a whole list of things for you to do today. my favorite is number three!
those were for the church breakfast.
hammocks! get your hammocks!
the price is ten dollars, but i must warn you, this is no ordinary hammock. its webbing is a mesh of comfort... and evil.
chores? me need clone.
nuh-uh.
why you little...
yay!
no problem! discover okay?
homie, i must say you have the energy of twenty men lately.
i do!
dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?
good god, we're doomed!
thank you, general. that's a big relief. the horde is almost dead! there's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning.
...twenty eight, twenty nine... there's one missing.
break into the bank and snatch that dough... please don't hurt our family.
pardon the grabbing, but i've perfected a device that could save us all... a time machine. we can go back to the past and save our guns.
...poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator...
hey everyone, that's us!
dad, what are you doing?
now he may try to slobber on your crotch.
homer, someone's in trouble!
homie, something very creepy is going on here.
i think i'm going to do a little sleuthing.
hate to be a needy neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?
oh, c'mon homer. all i'm asking is for you to yank my teats and harvest my milk.
oooh, that's nice. you're actually quite gentle when you want to be.
shhh. hey.
hey dad, check it out!
we were just playing.
let's eat maggie.
sure, check in the fridge. wait a minute. i'm at work. ya gotta pay for it.
i'm afraid so.
yuh-huh.
are you gonna buy those toads or just lick 'em?
thanks for the donation, mr. simpson. do you feel okay?
homer, i'm so sorry. have a free beer.
homer, can you say the alphabet backwards?
hey, i'm worried.
ah, rats.
where to, pal?
homie, it's five p.m. we're having dinner.
no, it was the night you got loaded at moe's and the car had to be towed home.
it's true. i couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. i had to tell mr. burns you had violent diarrhea.
there's no light rail in springfield.
i will, dad.
another proud moment for the simpsons.
oh, you big fooler. pretending not to remember so you could surprise us.
then there's those other days. where you just wish you never got married or had kids. one minute, you're a carefree teenager with dreams of being a rock star, or a photographer for playboy... then bam, some babe gets her claws in ya...and boom, you got a buncha kids that always need love. so whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye...
so i'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
have you always resented us, dad?
sorry we ruined your life, homer.
a place where you'll never be bothered by your family again. get out of the car, homer.
rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!
we had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point.
and even though you knew i ratted you out to the irs, you never busted me on it.
i don't know, but it's starting to get dark.
how ya doin'?
welcome to rock 'n' roll fantasy camp, where you'll experience the complete rock 'n' roll lifestyle, without the lawsuits and std's.
now you're all here for one reason...
you took pills you found on the floor?
but there's lots of other fun instruments, like bass. come on, who'd like to be a bass player?
my image!
i'm telling mr. jagger.
fire! / yes! / all right! fire! / hey!
setzer.
what is it, homer?
we've gotta start using a cheaper oatmeal.
lyrics are the hardest part of songwriting. but when you come up with something meaningful and heartfelt...
will you stop saying that?
you just want mindless generic rock?
gettin' away from the gig can be a matter of life and death, so you gotta be in great physical shape. okay, follow me! paparazzi to the left!
uh, you rock, homer.
that was great, homie.
camp is over, homer.
i'll take that.
dad, you knew this day was coming.
stop kicking me, dad!
no, i'm fine.
cheer up, homer. it's only rock 'n' roll camp.
for serious, homer.
sir, you can't...
wow homer, i ain't had front row seats since my moonie wedding.
i'm so proud of you, homie. it's like you're kid rock and i'm pamela anderson lee rock.
there you are. we thought we were going to have to go on without you.
uh, homer, you didn't think you were gonna be playing with--
look, sorry if there's been a misunderstanding, homer. we really just need you to tap the mics and say "test, test."
i'm his groupie! am i saying that right, "groupie?"
hey, he's not rocking out at all.
not on my shift.
did you know it was going to turn into a riot, dad?
did they ever find tom petty's toe?
we're doing a gig tomorrow to benefit the victims of tonight's gig, and we'd consider it an honor if you'd join us.
are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, dad?
mr. simpson, this zone is for school buses only.
a year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.
get back, honky cat! those systems are too expensive.
and the winner by a nose is "no risk"!
okay, now all we have to do is install your satellite dish. can you be home from eight am monday morning, through june?
boy, that's jim dandy roof candy! i'd love to come over some time and watch that church channel.
cool! it's the nbc news feed!
it's wednesday night!
why don't you turn off the tv and join us for dessert? i made a pie.
would you like some ice cream with that?
got it.
i'm so sorry. lisa's a very special little girl, and we'll spare no expense in finding her.
the plastic casing from the tip of bart's shoelace! a mother knows!
oh my special little guys. you're okay, you're okay!
harry truman triumphs by two million votes.
i win, dad. that means i get to choose today's father-daughter activity!
we're building homes for the homeless.
dad, what is that?
dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring.
this is a band-aid wrapped in tin foil.
well, he's not much to look at...but he is a good father...hel-lo, ring tan line! he's new on the market!
well, i've read enough articles about flirting to know it when i see it.
sometimes i worry you might think about other women.
that doesn't sound very convincing.
not feeling well. going to bed. dinner and breakfast are on the table.
homer, let me explain something--
now, don't get too used to these. that awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days.
whatever bart is saying is a lie. mom! what happened? your endowment's bigger than harvard's.
mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?
hooray!
kiki highsmith, highsmith modeling. honey, i like your look.
that's not why i'm here. i can offer your wife a lot of modeling work. trade shows to start, then who knows?
that's great, mom. but don't forget... i got krusty in hot water / now i've got to help him out / da da da...
oh, i don't get a song? mom got a song.
lisa learned a lesson! lisa learned a lesson!
i finally feel like me again. you're not disappointed, are you?
anyway, you're the only man i want ogling me.
oh, homie.
marge let her jugs out...
who let her jugs out...?
yes, if he's smart, he'll hold out for millions.
i don't know. work the stomach. mm... that takes me back.
this is a joke. you'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood.
it's a hockey game!
this sucks. how come lisa gets something and i don't?
your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.
why do you always hire the cheapest guy?
but where will we live?
sorry, folks. every hotel room in town is booked.
i do not want another lecture from a german backpacker about how we don't appreciate the national park system.
wow, lenny. your apartment is stunning.
come on, guys, you gotta stay. tonight's the big cock fight. ah-- we can eat the loser...
oh yeah, the gimmick is, it's a house from 1895. and you gotta do everything like they did back then.
you could save mckinley.
they go to pieces over nothing. they're perfect for reality tv.
oh man, i can't wear this. i look like buster brown, whoever that is.
hey, you should see how much trouble dad's having shaving with a straight razor.
well, okay. blow out that lamp and i'll take off my victorian undergarments.
no!
this has been the worst week of my life. i miss my toys, my video games... "mutt 'n' jeff" comics are not funny. they're gay, i get it.
yeah, i can't wait to see which one of 'em dies first.
with all this hard work, i'm too tired to worry about the world. and soon i will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!
mr. simpson, your contract allows us to do anything we want to you.
uh-huh, that's what we used.
oh no, everything's ruined. our good bellows... our stereopticon... squiggy! homer, your strop! your strop!
we're not allowed to interfere with the reality of the show, which reminds me... burn the leftovers! leave nothing!
psst! psst!
but now we're going to escape. we're going to overpower your crew and return to civilization.
and yet i've learned nothing.
no, homer, no! that's our only way home!
i think i'm gonna be sick.
yeah. if we read books we could form a club.
hey dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?
three minutes forty seconds -- a new personal best! maggie? no one will ever know.
help, please! someone throw me a stick!
ha, ha, ha. go ahead, look. the whole world already saw it in "nudist camp commandant." i wore nothing!
who ordered the steamed gentile?
don't worry, us pigs will catch this killer. now mr. simpson, is it possible you're living a double or triple life that your wife doesn't know about?
dad, i can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own.
fair enough. but now that we know what it can do, there's no need to... mother f...!
homer, think carefully. of all the people you have known, who might have reason to do you ill?
the late frank grimes...
ah. homer, in order to identify your assailant, i must follow you through the course of a normal day. just do what you usually do and the killer will reveal himself.
this is a normal day?
welcome to your springfield mardi gras headquarters. cast your vote now for this year's king!
our time is passing, old friend.
but your car was built in croatia. it's made from old soviet tanks.
homer please, the last thing you need is more enemies.
the trap is set. the killer will think this dummy is you, out for an evening stroll. now we lie in wait, like hungry cassius for noble caesar.
odds bodkins! 
thank you, lord.
i'd just come up behind him with a knife and slit his throat real quick-like.
listen homer, i don't know who your killer is, but i do know he'll strike again. your only hope is to stay completely out of sight.
homer simpson?
honey, the king of mardi gras has to ride around on a float all day. you'll be a sitting duck.
homer, it's a trap. you only won because somebody stuffed the ballot box with these.
but i'm afraid you'll get hurt.
today's tuesday and you've had six beers.
a mechanic...? my god, that's it! homer, you must get off that float! the brake line has been cut!
hey, how 'bout some beads?
i've saved a life... and it feels wonderful. and yet, i could just as easily drop you to your death.
everything going dark... like duff stout, the beer that made ireland famous. i love you, doris! i...
jesus is our only king.
frank grimes, junior.
don't you remember? your ape-like incompetence drove my father insane.
what's this? "extremely high voltage". well, i don't need safety gloves, because i'm homer simp--
dad! i figured it out! the murderer is...
dad, i'm really glad you're still alive.
well... i guess i've... dear god... grown accustomed to your face. i've grown accustomed to his face / and dreams of gouging out his eyes / i've grown accustomed to my hate / my plans to lacerate... to dis-embowel / to hear him howl. the very reason that i live / is plotting how to watch him die...
but i'm not tired!
and you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
nope.
sorry, grampa.
grampa, you're not even going.
i get to tamp the powder!
this woman carried me for nine and a half months. i was out for two weeks, then went back in.
i believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.
so many categories... gym teacher of the year, substitute teacher of the year, most wheelchair-accessible school award?
shut up!
julio estudiante...an inner-city math teacher who taught teenage gang members that differential equations are more powerful than bullets.
i love happy endings.
step away from the wall. step away from the wall.
mom, dad, my birthday's coming up, and girltech turbo diaries are in stores now.
just buy me the friggin' toy.
dad, you can't eat all those free samples. we've got to get lisa's present.
dad, you ate all the free samples. now you're eating men's slacks.
i'm anatomically correct! go ahead, take a peek. i wonder what mommy's medicine tastes like!
shop o' the mornin', homer! just call me "mall" flanders.
sounds like fun! let's party!
i wonder what this could be?
you were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
i don't like mcnuggets, i'm a vegetarian!
dad! that information is all wrong! maggie's a baby, not my best friend! you don't know anything about me!
i don't think so.
dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. it's too late.
yeah, at least you ain't aging six years for every one 'cause of your cow heart.
he found out who was cobbling shoes for me at night. turns out i have severe schizophrenia.
no, look lower.
let me guess. it's about a girl.
it's always a dame. usually with gams that don't quit. till they get to the shoes. and then they're only napping.
okay, i'll get a line on your kid. i charge fifty bucks a day. plus expenses.
chunky... lover... 53?
at aol.
is that miles davis' "birth of the cool?"
so you know one thing about me. big deal.
well, maybe.
dad, today was so great. the animal rights protest, a visit to the museum of sadness and oppression...
how'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? did mom help you?
what report?
you read the "loves his daughter" by yourself?
it's itemized.
yeah, but if i'd eaten the whole thing, it would've been free.
early on i was working under the theory that your daughter was a werewolf. it didn't pan out.
you'll regret the day you crossed dexter colt.
blackening our hair was a great idea, dad. i look just like a powerpuff girl.
lady penelope ariel-ponyweather.
your real name?
thank you. sign here, mr. uppercut.
uh, "a." and i'd like to add that proposition "hug lisa for me" has my full support.
aw... life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, dad. i feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been.
what? why?
why did you do that?
all right simpsons, the jig is up! we know you're in there!
i don't wanna eat from the trash.
they must have come from over there. those are the test animals! the detective must have sold them to the circus.
how ya doin'.
how did she find us?
i can't see!
hey dad, will you read me a bedtime story?
yeah! everything must go. even the painting of my nana. this was done on her wedding day. or should i say "deading day."
do you need some assistance picking over the tattered remains of my life?
what's there is there.
right this way. my first weight set.
they know you are talking about them.
sure, i'll carry you in this giant snuggli. i used it to carry rob schneider in the movie "my baby is an ugly man."
why is it ned flanders?
all right, just to the mailbox and back.
two, three, two...
ten, ten, ten, ten...
twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
oh my goodness, it looks just like the kwik-e-mart!
i'm a magazine rack.
what if she doesn't?
the air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.
no way.
stop it, please! i'm trying to eat. and all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
dad, do you plan to get in shape?
i got all the way out to the tree before i realized i'd left the house. i'm stronger than i've ever been! i don't have to go back inside. i'm not afraid!
not any more! you've just been marge-inalized!
hey, hot stuff. i've got a competition tomorrow. i could use a good-luck snuggle.
huh? why didn't mom make our lunch?
i'm tired of her criticizing my saggy glutes.
so then i pop my delts, clench and bam! not a dry eye in the house.
and that's why i didn't win!
you know, i really do miss being a lady.
mm-hmm.
dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a wnba game.
fine, i'll go back to being bored.
row 12...
... seat 16!
i'm sorry sir, your car is still blocked in...
that cuts the mustard with me.
what are you doing?
that's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
well, whatever i've got i owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. plus a little prayer now and then.
and now "ken burns," a documentary by ken burns about the life of ken burns.
i've never actually been to a baseball game. the fresh air gives me hives.
you're watching monkey olympics on fox!
she's throwing her diaper at the judges!
setting up a prayer station, eh, homer?
homer, god isn't some kind of holy concierge. you can't keep bugging him for every little thing.
i'll just call a plumber.
you know, most people pray silently.
your pipes have more roots than the list of all-time top-rated tv shows.
homer, we can't sue the church. they'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin.
homer, please don't sue the church. i'm asking you as your friend and neighbor.
we're very sorry for the victim's injury. but as this tape demonstrates, mr. simpson is accident prone.
okey-doke. we find for mr. simpson in the sum of one million dollars.
homer, for the last time... please give the church back. that is gonna drive me nuts.
and there are so many places to cloister myself!
well, the court has spoken, so... here you go. the baptismal font tends to run, you have to jiggle the handle. oh, and wednesday is garbage day.
dad, there's a bunch of people in the community outreach center.
so where's marge?
homer aren't you afraid you might be, i don't know, incurring god's wrath?
see, i don't know that he is. in the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt.
let us pray. dear lord, please spare this sinful town. they were misled by a demon in blue pants.
how could you make me baby stink breath and not even tell me?
your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a...
of course, the stock market's been down lately. but there must be some sort...
you spent all the money i earned?!
mom, i am sick of the way he treats me. he disrespects me and i'm just supposed to accept it?
i heard a wonderful saying today: "forgive and forget."
good point, dad. what would jesus do?
i'm here to serve you with a subpoena.
yes.
yes, i want to be emancipated.
mom, you've always been cool to me. but homer is a lousy dad and i'm not gonna take it anymore.
mr. simpson. your son alleges that you have an anger management problem...
all rise for the verdict.
no judge would send a pre-teen out on his own...
that boy's about as safe living with you as a crawdad in a gumbo shack. bart simpson, i declare you emancipated! further, i hereby garnish homer's wages until bart is fully repaid.
that means half your paycheck goes to bart!
sorry mom. i gotta go.
darn it! i keep pouring juice for five.
i think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.
hi guys... dad.
thanks dad, that means a lot to me.
just a reminder: if you're getting bogus returns on your investments...contact goldman sachs, the skewwwed financial planners. up next on the half-pipe, boarding legend tony hawk.
an extreme word?
i didn't say extreme to the max.
i'll lose millions in endorsements, but, okay. this board represents the ultimate in poser technology. it gives people the illusion they have talent.
just lock your feet in and the board does all the work.
now the portion of our event where champion tony hawk may be challenged by any unknown member of the audience.
dad, how drunk are you?
dad, you don't understand. this was never about being cool. it was about you not caring how i felt.
homer, you're heading for a parental face plant. do a 180 emotional ollie. 
mr. simpson, i like the way you handled yourself on that board. would you like to do a commercial for us?
excellent. i represent viagrogaine, the topical rub for bald, impotent men.
ooh, a new hamburger sandwich.
dude, take it easy on the fatty foods. you're running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart.
it was so exciting -- i actually got applause for being smart!
hey, hey the ribwich is back!
try the sauce -- i'm soaked in it!
and yet my children think i'm a failure.
sir, are you all right?
oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!
really? it won't be the same without you, dad.
dude. if you still want the ribwich, they're testing it in other markets. check out the tour schedule.
that's what we do. we're ribheads.
welcome to the games of the 34th spellympiad. i'm george plimpton, founder of the paris review. i also played the evil dean in "boner academy."
well, i'm just happy you guys all came up here to calgary with me.
dad, this is my moment in the sun. how can you miss it to be with a sandwich?
lisa, may i see you privately for a moment?
hey man, can you turn me on?
people, we went through something magical together -- and it's not important who got rich off of whom, or who was exposed to tainted what. and because you believed in my dream, i want you to fight over the last ribwich ever made. here.
i give-a you the lease-a to my car.
intransigence. "i..."
dad, you do care!
hold your horses. i was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.
oh, what a magical evening. the moonlight, the music, the water...
poor ned. this is his first jellyfish festival alone.
psst! homer!
no, it's sara sloane. i have a date with her tonight.
yep. why would that twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
well sir, that's very encouraging but i can't date a movie star. i'm no arthur miller or lyle lovett.
now she's dating mr. flanders. that's so romantic!
why, those guys are such leeches.
this is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. i better talk this over with the big man. homer, sara wants us to have s-e-x.
well, i'm not sure i want to do it. i mean "who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?" you know, the cow being me.
i bet we woulda lasted twice that long.
i need a quarter for the bus.
i got lisa's plankton kebabs!
how much longer is this going to go on?
dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?
i never thought i would say this, but i think we have to move.
occasionally, you might hear a faint roar...
it's a good offer. i advise you to take it.
why don't we go to our congressman?
quick! someone perform cpr.
that's ccr!
congressman wilcox was laid to rest today. a special election will be held next month to fill his vacant seat.
how can you say that?
because i was thinking about the american family! one family in particular, who was stepped on by the government and had nowhere else to turn.
i'm talking about the simpsons.
you said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. and now they're worse than ever.
dad, this is a kid's menu where you help yogi bear get to the washington monument.
we've gotta do something to help him.
excuse me, i think i can help. i've been working in this town for a long time, and well, i know how to get things done.
now homer, that southern congressman is your biggest obstacle. your job is to drink him under the table so he misses the vote. you think you can do it?
how 'bout a drinkin' contest, boy? right after i vote on the latest bill.
at last those planes are flying where they belong.
what about you and mom?
oh, okay.
who's naïve?
homie, i'm sorry... you know i usually bring my a-game to the bedroom... but tonight i just can't throw the heat.
you're so cute when you're begging for sex, but i'm just too tired.
game over.
welcome to "how to strip for your wife".
that oil was for the entire class! homer, take this quarter, call your mother and tell her you're never going to be a stripper.
you there, the greasy, naked bald man!
what would you say if i offered you the secret of true success?
the trick is to blot the oil. wiping just pushes it around.
friends, there's a force that runs through the universe. we used to call that force "god." we now call it "megatronics: the forty-eight tips to corporate success."
do you want to be the ultimate you?
do you want to yodel at the top of the corporate mountain?
will you write me a check made out to "cash?"
what's that ruckus?
uh-oh, that's toxic waste!
oh, have you now? well huzzah, huzzah. i'll just throw back my legs and pollute my britches with delight.
and what book is that? the ape who wanted a big bonus? stop wasting my time, you corn-fed man-cow. would you mind?
oh, homie. don't let it get you down. so mr. burns doesn't take you seriously? big whoop! who gives a doodle? whoopie ding dong doo!
who's this burns guy? somebody you work with?
well, if this guy's ridin' your rump, why don't you slap him some payback?
or give him some face time with sweet lady brick.
the owner of the plant is gone. all that's left is this little mirror he used to amuse himself. hello, pretty boy. that's quite a beak on you. who wants a kiss? who wants a kiss?
good lord! that canary was supposed to be my pigeon. i need to find a patsy quick!
yes, yes, hello. now, i need to find a patsy.
you're quite the friendly fellow, but right now i'm looking for a patsy.
finally, i would like to add to any nuclear inspectors in the crowd, that the titular head of the power plant is now mr. homer j. simpson.
that man's mad. smithers, get this bedlamite an alienist!
so, the caterpillar has emerged from its cocoon as a shark with a gun for a mouth. i only have one thing to say to that... bravo.
we clashed lances on the champs de mars, and i have been bested. the plant is yours. treat her well.
hey-ey-ey, goodbye!
oh, i don't think he was going that way.
dad, please. you're the head of a major corporation.
dad, have you looked at this earnings report?
this is your vacation.
homer i'll go over the year-end profit forecast if you'll stop looking at my boobs.
i got a gold star at school today, for my exposé on toxins in gold-star adhesive.
homie, i know you've got a lot of work to do. but this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family.
hey dad, you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight.
i don't wanna do that.
homie?
knock, knock.
scream all you like, no one will hear you!
keep begging. you're just wasting precious oxygen! brick by brick, i seal his doom.
hey dad, pitch to me!
hey! you nearly hit me on the head!
nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. all that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.
dad, my life lacks direction!
oh dad, look at this one!
we certainly do.
why did you say that? are you implying that i'm dumb?
dad, that's a moth.
dad, that's a kaleidoscope.
uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
boy, this light has really screwed up the animals.
live from new york it's saturday night!
palm recognized. access granted!
it worked -- i got my sky back! dad, look!
i wonder what mom came up with for this week's 'family wednesday.'
dad, we weren't playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking.
i'm in.
does anyone have any swan heads? i've got nothing but necks.
ooh, look how late it is. let's get you kids some coffee. homer, no scissors!
oh, i guess he's done with all the fun stuff.
i can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.
ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. but it looks like you're missin' a piece.
welcome to moe's. home of the finest bar crystal in springfield. i shouldn't have cheaped out on the shelf.
young man, you've ingested a dangerous amount of alcohol.
i found the missing puzzle piece. it was under maggie's eyelid!
it's james taylor!
ing...
bird...
homie, what's wrong?
oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?
homer, i'm sorry you saw that, but i was very upset that night.
well, i love you, of course. but a lot of things you do still drive me crazy.
a little bit, yeah.
you made your own breakfast? looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
well, there are a lot of beer cans around here.
homer, let it go. it's not always going to be perfect. we've been married for ten years.
well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
but you're not gonna get divorced like milhouse's parents, are you?
welcome to my place. i just have a few rules. if you see a necktie on the doorknob, i'm with a lady.
uh, homer, i think you want your house, next door.
hello, simpson.
homer, before you move in, you should know that julio and i have an active social life.
homer, what grady is saying is that, how can i put this? we might have a cocktails, say, where all the guests are male.
that's right, homer. we're gay.
i despise the springfield shopper. what is that? all the headlines are jokes. uch, where'd you buy this? from the guy on the exit ramp? this is disgusting.
it's either him or that girl who put "mother earth" as a reference. and with a male roommate, we can walk around naked.
that will be one hundred dollars.
your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
hey, i love watching you guys fight. it's my earliest memory.
oh, it shows! i haven't had a strangle that smooth since i was four.
yes, homie?
so, how was your visit home?
so, it's over between you two.
homie, i tried to tell you how i feel, but i can't find the right words. maybe he can.
homer, marge wrote me about what happened. and as soon as her check cleared, i was on the first reasonably-priced flight here.
yes.
they were pretty much the same, homer.
homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?
dad!
well, we've got the cure for that. margaritas!
homer, weren't you supposed to meet your wife half an hour ago?
now, for ye knights' and wenches' delectation, i have some royal proclamations. we welcome cub scout troop number 102, we wish a happy birthday to karen, and congratulations to marge and homer simpson on their reconciliation dinner.
oh homer, a guy as cool and special as you will have no trouble. believe me.
that was a close call. we took this much out of you. but it's still not as bad as the first time i treated you for alcohol poisoning.
destroyed your marriage? why, i've never seen a woman look so devoted. let's look at the tape.
and i still do.
well, you'll never have to.
homie, what are you thinking?
not true! but you are welcome to sing the many beloved public domain carols such as o tannenbaum, good king wenceslas, jesu joy of man's desiring--
well, the bible says it's fun to do stuff together. there's a stranger in the manger and his name is love take it, homer! oh, i got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus.
f-l-a-n-r-d-s!
yeah, he wishes.
no thanks. but i would like to sing it with you and produce it.
e-r-s!
f-l-a!
d-e-r!
you don't have to move your feet / just hate flanders to the disco beat...
i am so sick of that song!
why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?
i still think you should have left that at the motel.
balloon ride, wax museum, the denzel washington monument, colonial phoenix, hey, dude ranch! and there's no radio or tv, so we won't have to hear your song!
"on this battleground in 1881, fifty-six indians lost their lives and four brave americans lost their hats."
i'll show you how they get on a horse where i come from. daddy, i need upsies!
would you like to be photographed in my great-grandfather's headdress? he unified the nations of the western plains. five dollars, or three for twelve.
unfortunately, the beaver is also our god. in retrospect it was a poor choice.
eight.
four.
i'll save you!
oh no! they're making beautiful music together!
they took the bait. let's go.
drink deep from these cups. the bear urine will make you strong. actually, it's fresca.
homer, those are elk.
lisa, welcome to love. it's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. but then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts.
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?
hey, you passed the lumberyard.
isn't this dangerous?
i'm impressed that you drew up blueprints, but these are for a go-kart track.
you said his name two seconds ago.
gotcha.
oh, that's it. you are going down.
the amish are so industrious. not like those shiftless mennonites.
/ help!
homie, get out of that treehouse!
our little hero sure likes kahlua and cream.
mr. simpson, how long have you been a cat person?
seems like you're quite the animal lover. do you have any other pets? a dog perhaps?
stop it, homer, that's inhumane! use the choke chain!
according to this contract, we have to change his name to "suds mcduff."
it also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the duff corporate jet.
dad, five minutes ago you hated him.
...eight, nine, ten wads of cash. your dog has sent duff beer sales through the roof.
oh really? well this tape says different.
dad, you can't let him take our dog!
look, to get our dog back, we need a plan.
this stunt cost fifty million dollars!
and you've been bitching about it for thirty years.
don't send a duff dog to do a duffman's job. hold on, sir. soon you'll be filling your lungs with duff, duff lite, or new duff blue -- tap into the peppermint glacier. are you there, god? it's me, duffman.
all we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
uh-oh, dad. i think he peed on the rug.
i think he left a "big hug" in your lunch box.
that cat saved your life.
dad, you ate the last can of tuna.
okay, five more minutes and i'm chewing my hand off.
homie, where have you been? i've been calling all over for you!
he's editor-in-chimp!
lindsay naegle -- veriqual cellular. and i can offer you a whole range of cellular solutions.
i insist on it.
why don't you get one of those hands-free phones? it's the next best thing to paying attention to the road.
of course we have headsets. but you would be mad to stop there. tell me -- what is currently plugged into your car's cigarette lighter?
i guess i'll have to do all your driving chores. that's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.
why can't you use the local dry cleaner?
dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. why don't you take public transportation?
way to go, dad!
good for you, dad. could you get me some syrup?
we don't have time for choking!
i'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, i'm a full-time family chauffeur!
to hell with the livery commission!
we're playing dominoes.
why, you're the first one here! please accept this free ticket to the 1939 world's fair.
stop saying things!
hey, i'd like that. i can't. i have to go pick up grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station.
you shake me from my booty to my 'fro...
bite us.
hi homer. i'm actor steve buscemi.
you can't walk to turkmenistan!
i am so sorry, homie. how is your crushed pelvis?
i don't know what happened. i saw you and i went for the brake but i hit the accelerator!
that's okay. i can handle it. homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?
i'm sorry! i'm sorry!
gee, everything always works out for you. oh my god! let me help you up!
what? that's crazy.
that's ridiculous. i don't like you. i mean hate you, hate you, hate you! i hate you!
maybe we should see a counselor.
that's okay, take your time. all right, before you came in, i asked you each to make a list of the people that are most important to you. homer, you first.
that's us in a nutshell. i care so much about you, homer, but i'm not even on your list. excuse me.
all right. i have an answer. you must perform for her one completely unselfish gesture.
yeah, full custody, that's exactly what i... you're an idiot. you gotta knock her off her feet with something utterly romantic... something that says i care about you.
romantic dinner.
you wanna know how to make a peach crumble? kick it in the groin. ha, anyway, what's goin' on?
hey, me too. i could whip up my famous poulet au vin avec champignons à la carl.
oh homie, you got everyone in springfield here for me!
you hooked up in high school / now you've come so far / then you started to hate him / and hit him with your car.
i love you, too.
except a place to live and free food.
i want to thank you all so much.
vite! vite!
ned, i am so sorry.
i am so tired of that tautology.
you are so right, ned. there won't be a single minute where bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... homer, get over here!
you won't be seeing milhouse for a while. something about that boy just shakes up your soda. ooh, this looks interesting: the pre-teen braves.
dad, maybe you could lead bart's tribe.
ideally no, but...
i am "burger with fries." man, is that uninspired.
i smell smoke.
well, thank you. i'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible pre-teen brave experience.
the great spirit blessed us with beauty and abundance. the land gave birth to the trees, the animals frolicked in the waters, and the wind was so gentle it would tie your shoes for you. but that harmony has been shattered. and now the land weeps.
"we will crush you and smother your dreams. yours in christ, the cavalry kids."
oh, the indignity!
at least we made a lot of people sick.
it's on the back of our vests.
vip? that's us!
c'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the sumatran century flower.
because i know every time you say "pick a number from one to ten," it's always seven.
no, there were twelve.
the venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...
my baby!
well, this is it. the last call for moe. god. god, god... whaaa--?
ain't she adorable.
well, i have so much free time now that moe's our babysitter.
i can help you.
yeah, sure he was, nahasapasa-imraisin'apervert.
i peed my pants.
i had to. it's so weird watching the video and not getting any sound.
hey, you never cared about maggie 'til i started paying attention to her. last night at the bar you called her "raquel."
is that uh, "get out" like leave, or "get out" as in: "get out. you banged bridget fonda?"
now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender.
maggie's gone!
listen, i think we might have to make a trip to little italy.
maggie's right in the middle of that italian-american-mexican standoff!
no. you've got a family. i'm the guy with nothin' and no one. no, no, don't try to stop me.
thanks, moe. i'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper.
you thieving hussy! 
will everyone please stop fighting and burning!
i am death!
your time is up, bart simpson.
i guess so.
homer, it's trash day. will you just take him out to the curb?
dad, you've become the new grim reaper!
where's the regular guy? where's doug?
dad, were all those people on the list?
no!
all right.
thanks for not killing me, homie. here's an extra pork chop.
this is professor john frink, isn't it?
and i thought halle berry went nuts during her acceptance speech.
i thought our mysterious pranksters might be here tonight, so i covered the meeting hall with ultraviolet powder. behold the perpetrators!
why is bart so tall? and shaggy?
what happens if i press this button?
sorry, sorry, sorry!
don't go inside -- it's a trap!
the irrepressible hundred-year-old sky diver will be buried as soon as his body is found. now, it's time for the channel six "oops patrol!" this week one eagle-eyed viewer spotted this hilarious headline. mayor unveils erection to cheering crowd. this week's "oops patrol" t-shirt goes to...
it could always be a little better.
homer! win your own t-shirt! 
dad, the word's "desert." and those farmers are suffering!
don't drag me down with you, old man.
you always go with your gut. this time, why don't you listen to your brain?
no.
this is boring. can't we go home? this overpass smells like urine.
fresh urine.
homer, you're hugging a bum.
sorry about all the cloak and dagger homer, but the government is still after me for what i did in the sixties. they're probably tapping your phones and reading your mail.
to reach you, i called up my friends in the liberal media and planted that story about the giant pizza.
i saw this macaroni pencil-holder homer made me, and i realized how much i missed him.
not for someone who tips nine per cent.
i'm sorry, my wife left me this morning.
you gotta say somethin', she's lookin' at twenty years. and my legal license expires in fifteen minutes.
and peggy in the coffee shop, what a pistol. a mere nod in her direction and the refill was in the mug. the jets in the whirlpool anticipated my every move. when it was working. and three dollars for a local call? they should be the ones on trial!
oh, baby! now you're free to come back to me!
i read a book that said women like jerks.
homer, this really isn't necessary.
oh well, you snooze you lose. but uh, can i have my photo albums back?
dad, i'm just as sad as you are. what happened to grandma is an outrage.
she was acquitted. then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
well, they're transferring grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. i say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!
homer! what on earth are you doing?
homer, get out now and no one will ever know you were involved.
if you stay here, you'll be abandoning your family the way i abandoned you.
pipe down, jules verne.
homer, it's two in the morning.
i really shouldn't be here -- i have a problem with games of chance. i played candyland with maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
that was always on too late for me.
and the winner is, seventeen!
i'll be bringin' sparkplugs to chuck at people i don't like. like you!
i can't believe nelson is more popular than me.
no, i'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options...
where did you get that tutu?
lisa, you look so successful. like you're the wife of a businessman.
lis, skinner is using you. like a pawn on his unholy chess set.
they made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.
would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?
well, i guess this story has a happy ending after all. just like my last massage.
okay, let me take figure skating.
well, what can i be?
okay.
the best you'll ever have.
no one's touching the hors d'oeuvres.
well... someday i'd like to go on a nice vacation.
yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and i don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon.
well... okay. for mom, i'll do it. where should we go?
because i want to encourage all the world to come see the beauty of twenty-first century britain.
there's so much to see here: parliament, stratford-on-avon, the white cliffs of dover... oh, and you americans love castles -- there's a huge one in edinburgh, the city where i was born.
i'd love to, but i'm late for an appointment. i'm greeting a lovely dutch couple at gate 23. cheerio.
actually, i'm not a butler. i had already hired this cab when you got in, but the more the merrier and all that.
did you spend an unforgettable night with a soldier from the u.s. army in 1944? you did? was he from the first infantry division? he was? and was he a gentle caring lover? he was? sorry i bothered you. i don't know if i'm ever gonna find her.
now completely free of "mad fish disease."
you punched out three people on the street.
do you understand any part of what you just said?
it's a bet, lord daftwager.
thank you, my dear. please take these free tickets to my play.
we thespians believe it's bad luck to mention the name of this particular play out loud.
quiet, you blundering fool. you'll curse us all!
mom, you said macbeth!
homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. this is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever.
turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning...
we'll deal with him, your majesty.
changing of the guard!
what difference could it make? he hit the friggin' queen! i guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.
i'm a man!
i haven't had an easy life. i've seen my country ravaged by war, my family torn by tragedy and then, as i was innocently making my way to the shops to buy light bulbs, i was blindsided by this great lumbering brute.
poke the monster with a stick! tuppence a jab! c'mon, queue up, lads.
we found a secret tunnel out of the tower. it was used by sir walter raleigh!
smash it on, don't worry it. let the pike do the work.
push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.
englishwomen don't pump gas naked!
mummy, he's everything you said he was.
i picked mom a bouquet of erigeron elatiors. daisies. flowers.
lis, your stupid present will only last a week. mine will sit in a closet for years.
mighty yamses, we are weary of building your food pyramid. let my pickles go!
grampa! you have a job?
oh look, jaclyn smith has her own line of axe heads!
endorsed by the american carny association.
"kitchen carnival?" i love it! thank you, homie.
what is that?!
homer, are you spooning that snack?
i think you should get rid of her. then we can be together... forever!
dad, you got attacked by a bear?!
yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day.
you can strangle bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation.
i'm an intensive care bear.
all right. that's enough, fraidy sue. here's what you gotta do: find that bear what whupped you, and whup him back.
mr. simpson, if you want to find that bear that attacked you, use this. it tracks an electronic tag i stuck in the bear's ear. it's the same technology they use to keep tabs on gary busey.
oh, dear lord.
homer, there's no rear on that thing.
dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. that's the whole point of moby dick.
you're not going, and that's final.
or dead.
you're sneakin' out to fight that bear. i wanna go too.
why don't you take a bath in the river? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.
a killer bear is on the loose in springfield forest, and local laughingstock homer simpson is missing and presumed mauled.
a bounty has been placed on the rogue bear in the amount of ten thousand dollars.
well, i'm proud of you, homie. you set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.
no. okay.
maggie's locked inside!
i tried the coat hanger again. i don't understand why we only try ideas once.
oh well, i'm glad you think they're cute, 'cause they're your problem now.
three hundred and fifty dollars an hour.
...and so utterly repellant he...
now tonight's guest host... the ultimate place-holder... homer simpson!
dad, you have to say something. something meaningful!
uh, listen homer. i'd like to raise an issue.
about that, you know i've been with the show from the beginning and i was uh... i was wondering if i could get a small cost-of-living raise?
that light's a little bright. do you think they could move it?
ah, simpson, i hate to bother you when you're eating, but you're always eating. will you sign an autograph for my boy?
it's great, dad. you have tremendous power. and now it's time to put it to use.
i say live fast, die young, and leave a big fat corpse.
now, wait a minute. dirty words you can spell on your calculator is a very important subject. boobs. just like what girls got.
dad, you blew it. you listened to lisa. and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience.
come on, homie. we'll go to the "make your own sundae" place.
... ha.mo.shel be.khol-a.sher-lo sim-na yad.kha ta.khat ...
they're not getting married!
happy thanksgiving from the entire channel six family, including kent brockman, who's contractually permitted to replace himself with a cardboard cutout. the real kent is in a rehab clinic. we all wish him the best -- again.
and the first season of magnum p.i. with commentary by john hillerman. apparently, working in hawaii was a pleasure.
i think it's homer.
homer, you're the most selfish man i know.
all right, everyone. it's time for your christmas "boni." everyone gets a five dollar cafeteria voucher...and for your boy, a confectioner's card featuring a current baseballer. it's that rookie from the new york nine.
this is offensive to christians and prunes.
you have excellent taste. this is our finest talking astrolabe. it also comes with a notepad and a pen that works upside down.
today is the birthday of comedienne margaret cho.
can we get our big christmas tree now?
colombia's main export is coffee.
isn't it kind of dry?
what's that?
you wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!
you just don't get it, do you? christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself.
you can sleep on the couch tonight.
and now back to "mr. mcgrew's christmas carol."
i can't find my way back to the home.
i don't need love, i have money. sweet, sweet money!
spirit, surely there is some time to reform my selfish ways.
nooooooo!
dad? are you okay?
that last one looked kinda good.
you've made that promise before.
well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans.
these pants smell worse than my old pants.
oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. and tears are the sweetest sauce.
oh, very nice, ned. but i'm afraid you're a distant second this week.
that was led zeppelin.
homie, i'm so proud -- you changed more than i could imagined! you're even covering your mouth when you burp.
those are my feet.
you just tweezered my wang.
dad, you don't have to out-do mr. flanders. just remember the spirit of the season.
actually, most people now feel christmas has gotten too materialistic. in fact, as a buddhist, i believe people would be a lot happier without presents.
your behavior, it's like, it's like, not sanctioned by any governing body. you're like, wild.
stop! friends, what homer did was wrong. but i've been thinking -- maybe i was just as wrong to give you those gifts.
stop that! you can't pray on city property.
amen.
i got the roofi tickets! i got them fair and square and i kept my dignity. not like janey's mom.
that ad makes me look like a criminal.
that wasn't me!
three!
you're my rock, homie.
awww...
what are you going to do?
i always keep one near the bed for you.
it says "yes on two thirty-two". we want no on two thirty-two, yes on two forty-two.
they say "yes no two forty-two". and it's the night before the election and you haven't handed them out! i need to be alone right now.
can i bring my laser pointer?
i got it! bart, i got it! i ran here as fast as i...
it's no! his old bike is fine!
i see. so if my old bike didn't work, i would automatically get a new one?
i know how you feel, lis. no kid wants to outlive their pet.
can i, for true?
dad, no! think of the bike.
yeah, great workmanship.
haw haw! your dad's not handy!
face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. but you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. that's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news.
hey, it didn't fall apart. smash this six pack! awesome! i gotta tell milhouse.
oh, lisa. honey, it's okay. you're a buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life.
c'mon, homer. how long does it take to go to the bathroom? huh? dear bart...
what's this? knockahomer has dropped his hammer.
dad, what are all those cuts?
dad, it was so great -- knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!
this robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. i can't believe you've never seen him fight.
well, the next match is saturday. can you come then?
you guys are just in time. my dad's about to tell me something important about our robot.
don't worry, i'll raise him like the mean streets raised me.
my job was to keep lisa's hope alive. but instead, she's really depressed.
business, what business?
so, you fought all those robots?
that is so cool!
yeah! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! i am the luckiest kid in the world.
that robot has given birth to a man!
go! go! go! now's your chance!
why did you make it do that?
well, you did disappear a lot, but i have gone whole summers without seeing you.
i could also deep-fry the bag.
consider yourself fired!
okay, here's how it goes: buyers never tell you what they're willing to spend. and when they talk privately, we spy on them through this one-way mirror.
let's get outta here. i'm not shaking that guy's hand.
buy me! buy me! buy me! buy me!
don't you need training for that?
not if i pump your heart full of morphine first!
tonight? but i was hoping you could watch the kids while i work on my novel.
homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call.
i'm writing a novel!
for the third time, the hospital. you're an ambulance, not a taxi!
why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
oh homie, i've had the most exciting day...
i suppose i better. your father's a very private person.
homie, i finished my novel.
it's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
it's double-spaced.
did you read the book?
did you like it?
oh that's wonderful. and the characters didn't bother you at all?
and you're fine with me trying to get it published?
oh mr. homer, anything for a cuckolded boob, i mean, loyal customer.
nothing, nothing. it just seems your wife has an "active imagination."
you'll see when you read your wife's book.
if you do you'll see she lusts for flanders.
you told me you liked it! you didn't read it at all! you lied to me!
well... there is a place called nantucket.
it was only my imagination.
dear lord, please make homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts i had about the girl on the raisin box.
advice? just call me ann flanders!
...and a backrub can just be a backrub. it doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
oh, homie! you're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book.
that's the best review i've gotten. seriously. these reviews are terrible.
mom, that sounds a lot like the movie "amadeus," which was historically inaccurate. mozart worked hard on his music... salieri was a respected composer...
we suck!
attention american bar devils: it's our anniversary! free drinks for everyone!
what did you plan to get your wife, homer?
oh, you poor soul. you think that rat is a remote.
why are your clothes so dirty? and why do you smell like liquor? have you been clubbing? homie, they're beautiful. that chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! i feel a swoon coming on... here it is!
oh, you poor man. you smell worse than you did last time.
hey buddy, that's nice sign work. your penmanship is clear yet sad.
well, there are six schools of begging -- bad musician, messed-up vet, cripple, fake cripple, religious zealot, and crazy guy. i think you would do well with "crazy guy."
homie, i'd like to know what you've been doing after work.
i also found this in your drawer.
are these diamondique?
cubic diamondium?
dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
we finally have something to put in the wall safe. hostess twinkies?
kids? go ride bikes for a while, huh.
you're panhandling! i should have known from that panhandling sign! plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
homer, i don't need fancy things. and even if i did, this is the wrong way to get them. and to remind you of what you've done, i'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions.
nothing.
what're you talkin' about?
didn't have to, i'm a dude.
hey, my-my pants aren't down!
what's all that racket?!
what's going on?
it used to be the "leaning tower of pizza." they just painted the tower brown.
it's application day at miss wickerbottom's pre-nursery school.
you know, marge makes a good point -- competitive schools aren't for every baby.
i will hire a collection agency.
my baby has no future!
grocers don't make that much.
maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. c'mon.
well, congratulations. you're now as intelligent as a pig. let's see if you can move up to dolphin -- how many people in your family?
yes, thank you.
maggie, i can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over! look at these courses you'll be taking. "advanced peek-a-boo". 'got your nose' and other lies...
well, then... find a new identity.
all right, if i'm second rate as the smart kid, i'll find a new raison d'être.
this-is-huh-oh-muh-eh-er's-doc-tor. he's-too-sick-to-work-today.
i hope this typeface catches people's eye. it sure didn't move our old fondue set!
giant tongue.
maggie! the red button... hit the red button!
lisa! you're all right!
maggie, push the red button! you can do it. red!
uh-hmm.
i believe i can answer that.
she could be... at sweeping up hair.
but they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
sorry, pally, the dingleberries are sold out. but looking at you, i'm sure your kids are used to disappointment.
sold out... sorry... not a movie. the only movies starting now are "the re-deadening" and "teenage sex wager."
ah, two for "the re-deadening," please.
classic hollywood story -- the director saw my photo in a medical book.
oh yeah, there are lots of kids in it! they fall victim to a vicious--
mr. simpson, i'm scared.
homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you.
homie, that kojak is sexier than cannon and barnaby jones put together. i think he looks a little like you.
how about a little "interrogation?"
none other! i've been hiding in your attic -- living off the moisture i can suck from the rafters!
that's right. twice a week i get your email of the monkey peeing in his own mouth.
forgive me. i'm just so envious of the happiness you all have. can i please be part of it, just 'til i get back on my feet?
oh my. well, homer, maybe you should take him to moe's.
i fold. / me too. / i'm out. / i'm done.
very well. achem!
achem! flush. what have you got?
it's scum like you that undermine investor confidence.
you're the majority shareholder?
homer simpson, how do you respond to the charge that your company has betrayed the public trust?
you sir, are a moron. oh, for heaven's sakes!
hey dad, maybe this'll cheer you up. why you little... 
sorry you were wrongfully imprisoned, simpson.
homer, i believe that's lisa.
i have to admit, i'll miss having him around.
trebulon minor...?
kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? that's how i got the channel six weather girl to start wearing a bra.
we're gonna have to track randall curtis down and make him listen to us.
dad, that's our address.
well, northern california is wine country -- we could take a tour.
enjoy your tour, and take it easy on mr. curtis. your father and i will be across the street at the lush valley winery.
the doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter.
the mediterranean climate is reproduced by cool pacific winds, mixed with exhaust fumes from the highway.
mmm, it goes great with the jolly rancher i'm sucking on!
"fox broadcasting, 10201 west pico, building 203..."
well, i've been using it for laundry soap, but, okay. homie, you are so cute.
i don't talk like that.
well, you talk like marge, sorry i set the bed on fire. 
moe's tavern? that's your fun place, like me and the lamp store.
oh, my head! do you have to make such an unholy racket?
maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.
okay... and maybe you could cut back too.
i hope i can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
well, i don't want to be a "gloom-hilda." i guess one beer won't hurt. isn't that a little big?
have you ever walked on stilts? it's not that great.
are we home yet?
i can't believe i drove drunk.
where's your wife tonight, homer?
what? it's 'cause of her i put in a bidet. well, it's actually just a step ladder by the water fountain.
hey, look. i've been in the bartender business for a long time alright, i've heard it all.
what are you? you're like a monster! that's like the worst thing i ever heard anybody do to anybody. you should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up.
well, that's good too, i guess.
where's the package?
homer?
you let me believe that i'd done such a terrible thing?
of course.
yes, i really don't think you two should leave. he's a chronic alcoholic and you're in complete denial.
homie, i want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking.
well, that's no promise at all! it's important for me to see you take at least one step. then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
you really mean it?
the basement, sir.
homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. homer!
sir...other customers need to use that dressing room.
my baby boy is in jail! i'm the worst mom in the world.
you're a great mom. you were always there for bart with love and support. his acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
time's up!
so, why do you want to be a guard here?
keep away! keep away!
dad?!
his dad's a screw?
not so tough now, huh?
but he won't know where to go or what to eat.
i can't wait to lay my eggs in his brain.
oh bart, my troubled little lamb. you'll be in jail for so long. but i'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty.
we're having "make your own taco" night.
you're getting acid in the bed! i'm gonna sleep on the couch.
homer, this bachelor party seems to have peaked. would you please return my pants and/or underpants so i can go home?
grinch.
you know, homer, edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and i picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield.
homer, you're still talking to me!
principal skinner is having second thoughts? poor edna!
every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
spice up! spice up!
cowabunga one to fat load.
denied.
that cloud looks awesome. that rock looks awesome. my hands look awesome.
this is so sad.
drink or i'll die.
that was before i missed her smell, her warmth, her beautiful, beautiful penmanship!
really? you'll be my cyrano?
oh, that's so lovely. but it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!
homer, marge, if i could just speak to edna for a moment.
just why am i taking your advice?
there's no ring on that finger.
as tuned as we're gonna get in this humidity.
oh, but it can. i adore edna: she is near-mint and comes from a very limited edition -- females who will talk to me.
edna's with comic book guy? oh god, she's on the rebound! and you meet the worst guys on the rebound. it's how jackie got her "o"!
i wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
they're going into multi-purpose room b!
oh, it's very sweet, but i don't need... where's that coming from? a band in a closet! every girl's dream.
i do!
please don't make us go. if you make me get on that plane, i'll give myself diarrhea! i know how!
i'm only rotting on the right side.
like what? they'll do something with you that they hate?
the sweet love story that is older than the sea...
opinion noted. now if you don't mind, your father and i are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy.
homie, if i died, would you be sad?
homie, you know i'm usually good for a triple-x throw down, but between those kids and going to uncle tyrone's, we can't be alone.
you're never alone in this crapshack!
it's their hub. homie, look at them! honeymooners -- no kids, no worries.
not me, i do crunches.
what about uncle tyrone?
so we're upgrading you to first class.
this is so luxurious! i feel like i'm princess grace and princess di smashed together!
no!
seriously, with the new breast pumps, and diaper genies, and corporate flex-time, child-rearing oughta be a snap!
the kids tracked us down! our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
you're right, but where do we go?
homie, people in the other elevators can see us.
thank you, sir.
how 'bout the floor is made of lava? 
let me finish my sentence!
i don't know... homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?
what did those women expect? when you sign a contract with fox, you know you're gonna be betrayed and humiliated.
do you love that sooo-weet smell of farmer billy's bacon?
would you like to see how a pig goes from loving life to your fork and knife?
you'll see the hoof grinder! the marrow sluice! and of course, the five-story pig shredder, blessed by three popes. if you like bacon, you're gonna love it. and if you don't like bacon, well then the hell with you.
please, mr. simpson, please. i fear your smooches are premature. this is, in fact, a silver ticket.
"this silver ticket entitles you to judge the pig competition, at the springfield county fair."
this song is about a country i love -- you may have heard of it. it's called america.
i could please ms. barbra streisand / by spittin' on the flag / or stranglin' a bald eagle / on the cover of some mag / but i love this country / to me she has no sins / if you don't buy my record / then al qaeda wins!
one more felony assault, simpson, and you're goin' down. i didn't know i could fit in a bubble. i must be losin' weight.
shall we ever see springfield's costumed protector again?
i'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the pie man.
dad, i feel like i'm gonna throw up.
no, i think the expression is "peg."
sorry, no refunds. oh brother. why do we get all the weirdos here at the comic book store?
you can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
ooh, i'll bet he's ned flanders.
pie man, no! it's a trap!
shoot to kill!
dad?
dad, please. it's obvious you're pie man. we've been getting his mail for weeks.
you're not mild-mannered. you're often liquored-up and rude.
i want you to stop this, dad. before you get killed.
well, i know one thing you could do...
simpson, you're late, bald and stupid! i'm docking you a day's pay.
tell you what, homer -- you make one last hit, then you're out of the business forever. lisa would understand.
again?
simpson! you'll rue the day you took that pie tin, poked holes for eyes, and attached a rubber band around the back!
silence! or i'll chop you into suet for my murderous gerbils and hamsters. wait, i have a better idea. you'll work for me now.
do as i say or i'll tell the police. you'll do so much community service.
now open the folder. it contains your next victim.
oh, me too...
homie... are you the pie man?
girl scout cookies!
grow a spine on your own time, blimpo. just one second, sweetheart. now pie that brownie, fruitcake!
ga-ga. goo-goo. your assignment.
as springfield's youngest buddhist, i am deeply honored to introduce the dalai lama.
yeah, and homer's a dumbass! no offense, homer. ya dumbass.
dad, i think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to.
i know one person who believes you were the pie man, homie... me. i've known it all along.
'round and 'round the bottle twirls, i hope it stops on one of the girls. i hope you like the taste of ringworm medicine. 
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team?
your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
yes... and then your father broke my heart. and if i'd known he was you, i never would have married you!
granted.
i've kissed three girls.
you're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
oh, i'm sure it's a much nicer name than homer.
what did you say?
the perfect kiss!
but then your father showed his true colors.
ha ha! you said "dog doo"!
i can't believe i went five minutes without one of these dream sticks.
what, just 'cause she smooched you? was that special?
homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant.
no, homer.
no, homer.
homie, i know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. i guess it didn't mean that much to you.
i wish there was some way i could believe that.
oh, homie! you did care.
but now it can have a second meaning. oh, elvis.
well, that just leaves bart.
whoa, something's wrong! ah, ah, i can't hear!
i'm afraid the inoculation has swollen his ear holes shut! maybe this would be a good time to talk about side effects. the boy's hearing should clear up in a day. if it doesn't, call me in the bahamas. for now, he can express himself with this complimentary pen.
dad, he's deaf.
your child's behavior appalls me, not just as a principal, but as a veteran of america's only losing war.
goodbye, homer. i can't get drunk and vomit next to a guy i don't respect.
we've become pariahs! in the last two hours i've gotten one thousand hate spams.
we get it, mom.
dad, i am going on a talk show. i have to say something!
but i don't hate this country.
if by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, i do hate americans!
martha! play something to lighten the mood!
well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. check out all the left-wing celebrities.
homer, we've got to get outta here.
i know a way out.
i'm the last registered democrat. tax and spend! tax and spend! now, if you want to escape, you can do it during the prison talent show tomorrow night.
o beautiful / for spacious skies / for amber waves of grain...
my card here says "aclu" / now look what i'm going to do...
wait right here for our encore...
dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?
no.
swim toward san francisco!
there's a ship! we're saved!
the food is so delicious here. and these chanel suits are five for a dollar! i'm using a jacket as a napkin.
name?
from now on, you're the simps!
gee, i never noticed that before. he's got a tree in his eye!
you don't sell roadside corn.
well, at least some good came out of today.
i'll just pay the fine.
publish it myself? why not? i could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. i'd be a publisher, just like katherine graham!
thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of the red dress press, dad.
so, has your daughter always been such a righteous little rabble-rouser?
fascinating. do go on.
you saw right through me. well done! have some congratulatory drugs.
now, tell me more about your daughter. and speak into the lamp.
dad, how could you say these things?
take my wallet and leave me alone!
look at you go. type-ity type, type, type!
the homer times?
am i the only one here who's in horrible pain?
homer, what are you doing?
my, you look awfully pale. let's get you some fresh air.
just wriggle loose. i'll catch ya, li'l critter! what the family circus? a second premonition came to fruition. lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom? well i didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich.
country parmesan.
don't worry, sweetie. i am not going to kill your father.
homer, please, don't tempt the gods. i-i mean god! there's-there's one god! only one! well, sometimes there's three.
quit whackin' my barrel!
homer, stay away from the nuclear plant.
but you're gonna kill us all...
press... destruct... button. don't do it! don't do it! you'll kill everyone! do it! do it! kill everyone!
yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. the garage made it to heaven too!
homer simpson, it's time you got what's coming to you. your frisbee.
oh yeah. just stay away from the three bean salad.
prior to ingestion, the pill must be reduced by my amazing new shrink ray.
now, you must enter the subclavian vein!
dad, you should listen to him. he's a man of science and you can barely read!
why is my swimsuit so revealing?
where'd you get that rib?
and white blood cells are attacking my clothes! although i must admit, they know where to stop.
don't worry. we'll be fine!
oh, i feel full enough as it is.
cheer up, my chubby inner child. i've got a feeling everything's going to work out fine. because i've got you under my skin...
it's so beautiful and modern. ooh, a sub-zero fridge...
this is the kitchen i've always wanted. ooh, a bread maker-maker!
homie, when i married you, i knew we wouldn't live in luxury.
but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
maybe you should turn off the power.
don't demolish along the way!
playdude magazines? have you been hiding bosom rags from me?
these magazines are from before we were married. maybe you should throw them away.
i'm not wearing any clothes. so why don't i just splay myself on a pool table!
okay, here's your precious articles.
i think you used too much plaster.
i never stopped telling you.
that's all right, mrs. simpson. many husbands feel emasculated when their wife must turn to a professional to satisfy her remodeling needs.
what's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?
bart, can you come in here for a second?
it's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!
listen here, simpson. your son has been exposing our kids to adult themes, unabashed dictionaries, and the lesser short fiction of john cheever!
ralphie wants to go on the pill!
i can't believe my mom would cheat.
oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul.
yes.
whoa, easy there, pardner. 
blood for creme! blood for creme!
bachelors are always squeezin' stuff!
i'm just spreadin' the playdude philosophy. hi-fi's, norman mailer, gettin' some...
uh... toys?
oh yeah.
because we're poor?
thanks, honey, for saving me from myself.
b.f.d. i've had your scrambled eggs, homer. the secret ingredient is whiskey.
dad, the kids at school said my butt's big.
check it out, homes. you said if i ever got a hundred on a test, you'd throw me a party. there's my hundred -- where's my party?
homer, the capital of kentucky is frankfort.
see, it's all legit. now make with the party.
people, please. it's a school night.
duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ...
next on abc, who's dropping by to see george lopez? we pray it's you!
i never meant to leave you, nelson. but uh, something awful happened when i went to the store.
i wish it were that simple. i really do.
sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
i guess. but there's a long way to go.
i'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
that was you.
perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.
it's a media circus!
a media circus.
i didn't think anyone successful came from springfield.
technically he was born in shelbyville.
mayah quimby is my er ah, fathah. give me one million dollahs!
homer simpson.
i remember you from high school. you barfed in my tuba.
homer.
you know, chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place.
homer, why do you always have to show that to company?
homer, what are you doing?
did you just swallow another bone?
chloe has such an amazing life. i wonder what would have happened if i'd stuck with journalism.
yeah, i guess.
that's a sweet thought, homie.
no one's fighting over you!
what did i do?
i don't see lisa in any of the seminars!
she's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? that's it! she is off the christmas card list.
booo!
we've gotta go now!
anybody i know.
mom, i wanna be just like you. i mean the lava part, not saving lisa.
...hind the 'fridgerator...
i'm not gonna grow up!
i thought it was chocolate milk!
well, i like t-shirts with a nice joke, like "support our troops."
ooh!
you're suspended without pay! take your clacking balls and go. and on your way out, remove all the fillings you got under our dental plan.
the change magician will change your life... for the better! results may vary. machine does not actually sort change. order today!
how much?
here's fifty.
some of us have to get up for work tomorrow.
yeah. well, enjoy the autumn of your years, jerk.
your bill, sir.
dad, the bill's only a hundred.
homer, use your inside voice.
...or find inclusion in the tribe by caring for vulnerable young cubs.
great! will you play malibu stacy with me?
done and done. i'm going to the organic market!
i can't run, i'm wearing flip-flops!
it's my entry for the all-school science fair. it shows the history of nuclear physics, from marie curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor.
a robot?! last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. i don't have a chance now.
well, we're supposed to do this without parental help.
dad?...
dad, what did you do?
yes...
dad, that could explode!
goose gladwell ripped me off and there's nothin' i can do about it. i'm just a stupid kid.
and homer, i can see you need me more than ever.
but there's spiders in the boxes.
i must warn you, sir, i was a green beret in vietnam. the things i saw there are what made me crazy.
okay, okay. here's all the money i've got.
thanks, dad.
are you sure that thing could really explode?
on the plus side, this rope is mighty soft. hm, touch it, kids.
i'm your supervisor!
since the dawn of aviation, man has built museums dedicated to the history of flight, and created audio-visual materials to orient visitors to those museums. from the hand-drawn flip book at the wright brothers' museum... to the imax movie at cape canaveral... aviation museum audio-visual materials have taken patrons and docents alike on a rocket ride to comprehension. this is the story of those materials.
here we have a vintage film of the original springfield wing walkers, including our own agnes skinner.
i flew it at an altitude of six feet for a distance of four-and-a-half feet. then we discovered rain makes it catch fire. then the führer fired me.
is your sense of outrage dulled?
now that mr. burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases.
that show's gone off the air.
uh-huh.
i've got the answer!
oh thank god it's the right place. i burst into four homes before this one. now listen. all the drugs we want are right across the border. i have a friend who'll help us.
a-lo-ha!
my dad, the drug mule.
help me out, homer. my little roddy needs his insulin. breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing.
if you let us come, i will give you ten minutes alone with my squishee machine, do what you will.
well where's your super-team now?
but the infinite beauty-- / but the bible says--
your jacket, señor. thank god we did not stitch your name over the breast.
i just wish we could make one last big score. but we could never drive past the border patrol.
smuggle drugs in a plane? that'll never work!
i've got everything you need.
well, i've always wanted to see a man with the i.q. of a child executed by the state. we don't get that up here.
we're losing altitude. time to dump all unnecessary weight.
it's no use. we've got to make an emergency landing.
now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage.
a roll, sir?
oatmeal?
how rude! what do i have to do to enjoy a sunday brunch with my secret other family?
i wouldn't drink that. from the looks of this place, it might kill you.
hey, a beer's a beer.
do whatever you have to do to save moe's. i love my homie.
thanks, homer. no one's ever trusted me before -- except for that one guy who shouldn't have.
homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement.
you gave the money to moe? how's he gonna pay us back?
well, maybe i'll go to moe's too, seeing as i'm now part owner.
i would like it. you never come to my mother's.
i'm here protecting our investment. i'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
and they seem awfully chummy.
i'm not inferring anything. you infer. i imply.
boy, what a night! moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush. here, watch. get lost, rummy!
i know, i used to think of moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. but now that i've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded.
hey, also, i wanna....
howdy, partner! why don't you sit next to us?
uh yeah, how ya doin' there, homer? did you ever pass that g.i. joe you swallowed?
oh, marge told me. we share everything.
homer, it's time you learned the sad truth.
although there's no physical intimacy, there's a deep spiritual connection that threatens to destroy your marriage.
engage her feelings, become her friend... ooh, get her a life magazine from the week she was born. i'll always treasure mine.
oh, i'm too tired to talk.
cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!
where's mom going with uncle moe?
well, if hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport.
simpson, you were going a hundred in a twenty-five zone. and you're not gonna flirt your way outta this one.
homer! how'd you get in here?
you don't deserve her! you know nothin' about marge -- what's her favorite food?
he's right.
shut it! shut it!
homer, i made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. and besides... i love you. you're my homie-womie-romie-domie...
love love will keep us together
you'd better stop
i said stop
step right up, and bid on items donated by local businesses!
first up is this video camera.
sold!
fat wad! i love it!
five-time rushing leader, two-time mvp and star of a disney channel movie. i played the gentle giant, "stay-off-drugs-ia".
i wanna buy the rights to that dance for a thousand dollars!
my workman-like touchdowns never make the highlight reel. but if i add your shameless shenanigans, i'll be on espn every night!
you damn straight. and i'll buy any other dances you got too.
"the view, sir." then show ass. got it.
looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.
homer, this is lebron james. the fans love my dunks, but they hate my dancin'.
homer, you know that's when i play with neighborhood dogs!
homer simpson, we work for the commissioner of football. and he wants to see you.
here's why we called you in: we want you to produce this year's super bowl halftime show!
fine. do it for free.
fine. pay us.
i now pronounce you pac man and wife.
oh homie, don't worry. i'm sure you'll come up with a great idea.
we're ready for rehearsal, mr. simpson. so, what do we do?
yeah. i made a great film, but i'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. i'm like michael moore, except i'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and god loves me. i just wish i could find some way to spread my message.
wait a minute -- you've got a medium and i've got a message. maybe god brought us together for a reason.
frank went to the men's room. i'm joe.
not in here, i don't.
you see? you see?
but i like to stand for good sportsmanship.
and with time running out, the seminoles are on the warpath!
stay tuned for sitcom sunday-
i think he swallowed the remote.
dad, can i go to a rap concert? tickets are fifty dollars.
okay, what if i pay for it myself?
i love you, dad.
oh did he? homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!
don't argue with marge, i know what's best / the only rap in this crib, keeps sandwiches fresh! fresh fr-fr-fresh for mommy's baby boy
here you go, you little yellow cracker... now let's go murder our enemies. peace.
that little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!
well, time to face my punishment like a man... or, lie my way out of it like a kid.
thanksgiving's not for months.
do what i say and bart won't get hurt.
homer!
oh bart, i'm so glad you're okay.
dad!? why did you do that?
why did you burn up your shirt?
all right, people, we got a situation here. your daughter's gonna blow our whole deal sky high.
no, lisa!
wait a minute. why do we have to come clean? nobody's been hurt. everyone's happier with the lie.
wait just a minute.
that's a very noble sentiment, lisa. but for once in your life, can't you just be cool?
dad, i don't understand. after all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?
lovejoy's an idiot -- his church is giving up hot gobs of gay green. he could get two hundred bucks a couple.
you are now an ordained minister.
i do.
homer, you married every gay couple in town.
don't you push them! they've gotta work that out for themselves.
well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?
i mean a man and a woman.
straight.
i can't. i just can't. homer, have we started down a slippery slope, where marriage becomes so meaningless that anyone could marry anything?
well, call me old fashioned, but i believe that marriage described in the bible--
homer, your impulsive marriages are gonna lead to a lot of divorces.
hey saturated fats, i came to ask you a favor.
oh no. no no. no. i'm just... surprised.
oh no. oh no. why would it be? i love you and i love gay marriage, so i'd be a super-hypocrite if i didn't love your gay marriage. right?
it smells like cheeseburgers.
is this one of those reality deals where a guy gets a million bucks for marrying aunt patty? but they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?
seriously dad, i'm worried. you should go on a diet.
it was so romantic -- like a scene from a hollywood movie...
oh, i get it. you act all liberal, but you can't handle it when your sister finds love in her own locker room. marge, if you can find it in your heart to accept me for who i am, i would love to see you at the ceremony. if not, i'll see you at homer's funeral...which should be pretty soon.
selma, we'll always be there for each other. i don't know about marge, though. if she doesn't show up today...i have no non-identical sister!
veronica, in you i have found a soul mate. you are the perfect woman for me: truthful, honest, hiding nothing.
at last i have found the yin to my yin.
i knew it! you think everyone in the world should have a big dumb man like you!
well, i've learned a lesson. just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'.
i'm down here, you idiot!
don't worry about that! someone's gotta greet the customers!
son, you are on fire! a million times better than that worthless old coot you replaced.
how would you like to be a full-time sprawl*mart greeter?
yes. the clerk also gave me this bench warrant for dad's arrest.
how am i supposed to know if i'm twenty feet away?
homer, why did you put the screwdriver at the end?
i like eating here with you, dad. especially without "don't have a cow, man."
you get to work overtime without us paying you extra.
if you don't, we'll ship you right back to mexico.
uh-huh. how sure of that are you?
it's a chance for you to catch up on all the work i'm assigning you now.
we placed a compliance chip in the back of your neck during the company physical.
homer, we took our chips out years ago.
we've learned to accept the things we cannot change. and steal everything that's not nailed down. i hope you won't judge us harshly...
homer, you forgot to eat your hot dog.
it's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.
don't cry, sweetie. everything's gonna be all right.
i'm not dead, idiot.
don't give up, aunt selma. china has thousands of baby girls who need adoption.
hello, homer. give me your peanuts and you can fly on my back.
oh, you are a very greedy man. the other dragons shall hear of this.
homer, i'm gonna need you to do something for me when we get to china.
homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform selma's life.
do it for me.
madam wu, these are... our children, bart and lisa. yes.
thank you, mr. simpson.
these are the famous shaolin temple monks. they pursue spiritual peace through mastery of bare-fisted murder.
boys, you see what i was talking about? the greatest things can happen.
so, mr. simpson, what do you do for a living?
homer, we need your acrobatic skills. only you can prevent this riot, and save our beloved communist dictatorship.
this is homer, your daddy. without him, i wouldn't have you.
homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing selma's husband was by far the sweetest.
okay, one quick snuggle.
they took my baby.
madam wu, we both love the enforcement of pointless rules. but there's a greater joy in bending the rules to help someone who thinks all hope is gone.
feast on my shorts, stupid father man.
honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. what would the kids and i do if something happened to you?
you keep almost dying. just look at our vacation photos. homie, if you die, i'm gonna have three kids to take care of. i want you to buy some life insurance. please?
mr. simpson, before we can insure you, we need to ask you some questions. have you ever had a heart attack?
are you a smoker?
you don't smoke!
you mean when the big tuna goes belly-up?
well, i just think we should be building a nest egg.
no more directory assistance! it's not free!
hey, hey, hey. no outside suds!
can you help me unload this soup from the car? there was a sale, so i bought four hundred cans.
oh honey, i know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away.
give us our independence, homer!
i, uh, was never president. i invented some kind of stove.
my scrimpings! 
did you spend our savings on a motor home?
i see. you were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? that's my half-assed dad!
i'll let you sass me!
you can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
well, it's a pleasure to meet another sultan of the slow lane. that's my rig over there. she's a roam-a-way silvercoach. thirty-four feet of walnut-burled freedom.
can i bring the rest of the convoy?
well, we'll give you regional beers.
homer! what are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
i know another place you can go -- to sleep!
well, you're not perfect either!
no, i don't see dad doing all that paperwork.
oh boy. let's get out of here before dad does a bad impression of mom.
and i'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your french fries. it was twenty years ago!
"dear mom and dad: we don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the rv back to the dealer." we've got to stop them.
oh, i've lost them! i can't see past all the suvs!
not good enough! kiss! french it up, lover boy!
first, raise my allowance.
help us!
just for that, we keep your children.
coptic christian.
hey, it's only money. and it did make a cool splash.
play?! all plays suck, all the time, and always will, and everyone knows it!
hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot!
let's see now... barely finished high school, you've challenged me to fight six times since the interview began...
"crack, smack, uppers, downers, outters, inners, horse tranquilizers, cow paralyzers, blue bombers, green goofers, yellow submarines, lsd mach three, and trace amounts of human urine!"
okay, new meat, you're clean.
no frank gehry-designed prison can hold me! ha ha!
nice nab, simpson. you did the right thing squealin' on that guy.
whatever. how'd you like to be a full-time rat?
so we have an agreement?
it's the only way you'll survive in here.
excellent! now, what have you got for me?
your uh, mother.
haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?
the prison snitch is killed! and that could be you! because you're the prison snitch!
pssst. there's a jailbreak tonight.
i sent you an e-vite. you never responded. nice netiquette, jerk.
homer! homer, where are you?
oh, you must be michael's dad!
i want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
done and done, sir.
no dad, you fell asleep in front of the tv watching "the towering inferno."
kids, come down for your prom photo! oooh. smile! oh it's so great. we can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. i'm so proud of you. lisa, graduating two years early, and bart... graduating.
homer, we're separated now. you can't just walk in without knocking.
homer, just settle down. we just got a postcard from maggie. she's really enjoying alaska.
all right! you guys are my new best friends.
watch it with the attitude, mister. you came from my back fat!
oh please, not this again.
actually, homer, i'm... into your lady.
and i'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea.
homer, do something about this leak!
that teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!
for he's a jolly good fellow...
i live here now. you're looking at the new owner of the little caesar's down the street. pizza, pizza. pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza. sorry. that button sticks.
we couldn't tell you ahead of time, because you'd spill the beans.
six years' planning down the drain!
oh great, homer! i bake a cake shaped like lenny's favorite barstool, and you wreck it.
i got my own problems. i just lost this eye last night.
look at the size of that nacho plate! i haven't seen this much melted cheese since i left my billy joel albums out in the sun.
hey, you wanna split this?
hey, my name's ray -- ray magini.
sure, i'll help ya, under one condition -- you gotta help me finish this pitcher of beer.
now, for my first act as president...
do that to me one more time / once is never enough / with a man like you...
homer! i woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
knockers on route 98.
i'm psychic. look, i don't know if i want a roofer who hangs out in bars.
eh, i got standards. i don't hand out high-fives like chiclets.
hey, homer.
ah, this is gonna take some work. tell me, was the roof in good condition when you bought the house?
no problem. accidents happen.
hey homer!
oh sorry man, i gotta go. this says my kid attempted something. i hate the way these things cut off.
it's after six -- he's not coming back. he's a lousy roofer and a flake!
i don't want to hear any more about ray. tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.
you're not married to ray!
hey homer! look, i just came down with a case of shingles.
what are you doing? why aren't you fixing the roof?
i'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable ray! who, by the way, i've never even met!
homer, how did you think i'd feel when i saw that?
homer, come down for dinner.
homer, i know where ray is.
sweetheart, your friend ray is in your head.
you have to understand -- ray doesn't exist.
homer!
we'll let you go when you admit there is no ray magini.
homer, no one has ever seen ray but you.
no i didn't, dad. i saw you talking to yourself.
sorry, homer. you'll have to call me a ray-theist, 'cause i don't believe i saw him.
actually, the technical term is electroconvulsive therapy.
when you're gettin' juiced, can you hold my turtle? i wanna bring him back to life.
homer, that's just to bite on, not to eat--
that was rubber covered in vaseline!
oh sorry, homer. but recent historical evidence indicates that robin hood did not actually exist.
dad!
hello, homer.
hey, no one calls me a monster and questions my existence!
yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all crooks. it's true.
well, homer, i could make it up to you... maybe a free eye-scraping.
homer, can i please knock off? i've got surgery in the morning.
so as i was saying, homer, mondays, nine o'clock, cbs. they say everybody loves that guy, but i don't get it.
it's monday, nine o'clock, cbs.
cbs.
nine o'clock.
monday. monday, nine o'clock.
nine o'clock.
cbs.
monday.
television.
nine o'clock on monday.
it's only on on monday.
nine o'clock. it's from nine to nine thirty.
not the radio, television.
nine o'clock.
television.
oh, so i've been replaced by a machine?
my heart! it hurts so much! like it's caught in a vice!
okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. but i made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you. it's graffiti you can eatie!
where are you really going?
i'd better tell dad.
uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?
tough love? of course, this has never made sense! the sign shop guy lied. stanley! you didn't question the word "luck?" now look what we've got. thanks for the correction, that's part of the honesty.
i already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner.
this fat camp can save bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. homer, maybe you could ask mr. burns for a raise.
i know how we can raise money!
let's see here. i can offer you uh, fifty dollars a week.
here's your tip, baldylocks. if you want it, dance and sing.
they want a second verse. i hope he knows it.
not for long -- i'm saying goodbye to scammer and z-dog. i've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
uh, please to have new facecloth. schnell.
to disneyland! where we will heap the scorn on goofy!
don't tell me "i didn't." that's my lucky belt. long story. good one. folks, you have three weeks left on a non-refundable weight-loss treatment. so if anybody else in the family wants to use it, use it now.
mr. simpson, you're suffering from... psi -- poor self esteem. it's not "i." every sign is wrong!
what are you eating now?!
you're a catastrophe. lemme have half of it.
i just want the cheese, i don't want the meat. i do want the meat.
i mean, just bite it, don't rip it. lemme have the whole thing. you'll get some later.
i'm driving. i'll kill us.
call the police.
no change without purchase.
a two ounce bag of chips. five ninety-nine.
it's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins, minerals and trace amounts of bug feces.
stop it! you'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. now, close your eyes...
and if that diamond ring turns brass / mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!
questioning the kid's sexuality -- well done.
how did you write a song so quickly?
i get it, i get it! she's good! looks like they love ya, kid. and the audience is always right! i wish i could say the same about my stockbroker. ah, what do you jerks know? that's a quality joke.
no, we did it, dad. i really do like working with you, dad. will you keep helping me?
la la la la la la la laaaaaaa.
i really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, dad.
really? what's wrong?
sorry, sweetie. we don't have green.
sweetie, tonight you were perfect...
mr. simpson, i brought those twizzlers you asked for.
he's crazy!
yeah. for once, couldn't you just turn into a good father? would that be so hard?
i don't like sausage.
dad... you're fired.
dad, i'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. you were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business.
no one asked you to yell and slash!
you're working with cameron now?
mr. simpson, about that...
so, are you a colonel or a captain?
actually, i think your father's still upset about the way things went down.
uh, sorry hon, this is all we got. who's next?
sure. sure thing, mr. s.!
thanks, dad.
dad, you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we've spent together. i don't care if i win, just as long as you're in my corner again.
well, i think you're the sweetest dad in the whole world.
now you're getting creepy.
oh. i see. well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause i'm not driving you.
dad?!
church? i'd rather play golf on the holiest day of the week.
it's the rapture, shawna. the rapture. the virtuous have gone to heaven, and the rest of us have been... left below!
it's the title of the movie.
why did i choose to be gay?
ooh, i could be the rachel to your jacob.
you too.
can i help you? we're having a sale on bible magnifying glasses.
yes, this one is fifteen per cent off.
homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. and you're reading books! word books! what's going on?
three million, one hundred and--
may eighteenth? that's one week from today!
this is kent brockman reporting live from downtown springfield, where overweight doomsayer homer simpson is predicting the world will end... next wednesday! homer, what turned you from sad drunk to mad monk?
homer, i'm glad you're getting exercise, i just wish it wasn't crazy exercise.
dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. yet. a hundred years, global warming... we're goners. but for now, do you think you could lighten up on this "left below" stuff?
'cause that girl's school says i can't do that no more.
that's springfield mesa! it's fifteen miles north, past the warren harding memorial through-hole!
dad, please don't go through with this. all through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong.
lisa's going! we're all going!
wait for me! i'm a-comin'!
two... one...
homie... i'd better start dinner.
dad, if you'll recall, i never believed in you, not for one second.
hey, fatwad! here's another thing you didn't predict.
yeah, school.
homer simpson! welcome to heaven. now let's get you some clothes, huh?
this is our nature walk... our pedicure hut... our state-of-the-art showroom, tonight featuring los lobos. and over there is our water slide, that's coming next year. it's gonna be super fantastic.
look, just don't use leprechaun labor. okay? don't do it. and the best part of heaven is, anything you wish for, you get... lickity split!
so if you need further assistance, just call the front desk and ask for andre, okay?
homer, what's wrong?
oh, don't tell me about family suffering. my son went down to earth once. i don't know what you people did to him, but he hasn't been the same since.
pass.
hey, what's the big idea, pally? why so crabby?
what do you want, homer?
but it's already started. to do what you're asking, i'd have to turn back time.
you want me to help you with your alcoholism?
why don't you just take these pamphlets?
in our second hour... humorist david sedaris takes a wry look at overcrowding in america's prisons.
hey, i won four free movie tickets! and it starts in half an hour!
a tv shark is not a babysitter!
howdy, homer. you here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?
all right, neighbor, i'll baby-sit.
yeah, so i can't see my own shrinky dink.
honey, you can be anything you want to be.
would you care for a segment?
he doesn't even know what's going on!
and you say mr. flanders remains completely ignorant of their dot-kama sutra?
boy, nothin' is sexier than still photos in a girlie magazine. wha?
what are you two doing?
c'mon. you tell him right now. ned, homer has something to tell you.
you know what i mean.
homer, is this true?
the bible says "cast your bread upon the waters." but all i got was a bunch of soggy bread.
dad, i don't think you realize what you've done. you've totally humiliated the best friend the simpsons ever had.
that's what we've been trying to tell you!
the flanders family has pulled up stakes. you have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
well, homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. but at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?
that's coming from next door!
that's too bad, 'cause my twins are just wakin' up, dude. encourage me!
louder!
just say "go! go! go"!
yeah, something tells me you won't starve. huh? huh chief? huh?
relax, dumbass. oh, by the way -- i borrowed some gas from your car. you dumbass.
huh? what are you doing? reminiscing... like a woman?
homer? what are you doing here?
really? well that's too bad, 'cause i'm not leaving. see, i like this place, and i've already got fatso here broken in. ain't that right, fatso?
oh yeah, tell it to the marines! okay, i give! why'd you do that? i was beggin' for mercy.
homer! did you steal the organ from the church?!
well, you've gotta take it back! it sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. mind if i waggle my finger a little bit?
think of the leg up you'd have!
i need two double a batteries. now!
what if there's a fire?
catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.
don't you touch bead one! homer, maybe we should be concerned. catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on friday...
yes'm. anima patri, et filio, et spiritui sancto...
that's latin, dad. the language of plutarch.
we're having our monthly pancake dinner. care to join us?
i understand. but can it wait 'til after bingo?
bingo.
how 'bout you just say "yay, i won."
i've never seen such masterful bingo playing. what's your secret, homer?
well that's true, but if you do break a rule, you can always find absolution in the sacrament of confession.
if you truly repent, then yes.
um, not quite, mr. simpson. i can only absolve you if you're a catholic.
...but it ends with bread and wine.
i knew they'd try to convert you! that's what they do! well i'm not having another twelve kids.
forget it! and you know, i went to a catholic wedding once. the incense ruined my pantsuit!
where's homer and bart?
yes, homer?
it wasn't a fair fight! your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting cinemax.
well, i'm gonna show bart that protestants can be hip too. how do you like those croutons?
strange as it sounds, dad, i agree with you.
oh bart, i knew one of these dumb things would work! my hive! my trademark hive!
well, now the bear has a surprise for you. he's not really a bear... he's a tiger! oh looky there, denver just won the ballgame...
who's professor pigskin?
how is that possible?
i get it. every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think professor pigskin is always right! that's when they ask for your money.
look, all i'm saying is, you really should think twice before...
dad, how much money did you bet?
if he mentions that pig again, use two hammers.
yeah. it's called "lemony lick-it: a series of horny events".
i want to see santa. he can explain why he gave me a playstation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.
homer, before i take the kids, i want you to swear you're not up to something.
and i'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
what is this, a reunion of "fahrenheit 9 on 1?"
homer! is this a snuggle film?!
how could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!
all right.
away from you.
you are.
boy, homer. i've never seen mom this mad.
bye bart! i love you, lisa! sleep tight, maggie! today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!
she should be back now. it's dinner time.
no. i mean ketchup.
hey, homer.
you told me to call. you wanted to see if your phone was workin'.
well ain't you got call waitin'?
be still! don't give it the phone! settle down, sugarplum. look what daddy's got in his pocket. yummy, yummy kelp. good girl. yes, yes. this animal means you no harm. she's a sweet old florida manatee. also known as a sea cow or a dugong.
oh yes, señora left for the coast with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science.
dad, i don't think we're gonna find mom today. and i'm sick of eating at restaurant chains i've never even heard of, like skobo's and dim willie's. ew.
country cousins? are they rubes? 'cause i don't cotton to rubes.
we're having lasagna and caesar salad.
so, homer, how are you?
and how is our lovely marge?
oh, why that's terrible!
homer?
ooo.
homie, i accept your apology.
but i'm not coming back yet.
i'm sorry, homie. i just can't find it in my heart to come back right now.
homer, i have no interest in stealing your wife, but marge is getting something from her work with me. something a strong, passionate woman like her needs: a purpose.
she doesn't love me. she's just trying to find herself.
i don't know everything. i'm just a man.
aw man, i just wish we could see their tears.
in fact, they're bigger than us.
you're a brave man. and we respect two things: bravery and tattoos that look like barbed wire. let's go.
what did you call us?
oh, my sweet, sweet homie! you sacrificed yourself for the manatees.
i'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband.
and i always will.
amen.
it's seven a.m. what are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?
okily-dokily, here's some french roast, now i'll go make toast.
a stamp museum?
well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. what ever happened to "please" and "thank you"?
instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
oh sure you can, sweetie. just don't make a habit of it.
so that's why i've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
lisa, honey. i know last night was tough, but all our kids sleep by themselves. we don't even hear maggie cry at night anymore! oh, wait a minute. there's no batteries in this thing.
homer, can you help me out here?
dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house.
hey, simpsons! that'll be forty bucks!
yeah, that's per axle. park over there in carl four. no early outs!
thanks to me, katherine blodgett, we have non-reflecting glass.
and i'm jumbo shrimp! maximum two servings!
what a lousy party. i don't care what apu was in a past life. in this life, he's a blabbermouth!
i know. i'm sorry.
grampa?
what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? hm?
well, i hope he's accompanied by the "how was your day" monster, and the "foot rub" monster and the let me just...
all i see is an empty grave. why don't you fill it, ya lazy bastard?
yeah.
ow.
did you bring those home movies of your daughter i asked for?
who was filming that scene?
i'm not chasing you, mr. simpson.
homer!
new pony?
maggie! that's not what you do with a hymnal. homer!
sweetie, i know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching! no! no!!! here, here play with your teddy bear. oh, sugar-booger!
homer, don't touch her! you've never had chicken pox.
oh, i'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! it could leave you sterile down there.
mmm. don't worry, dad. i'm saving one for you. i'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.
really? do you mind if i bring my boys over so she can infect rod and todd? then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
au contraire, man with no hair! you see, rod and todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!
you betcha! in fact, some parents have been known to hold "pox parties," so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please.
well, they might. but you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors...
all right! i never drank one of these without a cigarette in it!
almost anyone's got a chance now.
all right, we get it!
oh homie, you got chicken pox. but how?
stop eating the oatmeal! that's the third tub you've eaten!
milhouse! i need slender fingers to get me a pickle! this isn't mine. i have a message for your wife: stop sleeping with my husband!
the wife of your wife's lover!
you moron! marge is having an affair with kirk!
oh boy, am i beat! if you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!
how could you ask me that?
homer, you're crazy!
fine... no!
you don't trust me? after i salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! how dare you! get out of this house!
dad, i thought mom kicked you out of the house.
lisa, we don't need to know how. it's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war.
where are you staying?
where's my apology?
this is all my fault! i planted mom's bra in milhouse's parents' bed!
homer! i can save you both! just let go of the rock! just do it! trust me!
mom... dad. i'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
well, i guess you showed you do trust me after all.
i'm afraid your son is in a deep, deep coma from which he will never emerge.
a robot?
sure. let him have it.
more waffles, father?
did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
i will comply.
i hate going to the zoo. i feel so sorry for the animals.
we're still going to the toy store, right? and i can pick out as many toys as i want?
you told me he was at culinary school!
to get me, you'll have to go through your fa...
well, the important thing is we're a family again.
please don't accept this invitation, dad. hunting is cruel.
and there's bananas in that tree up there.
you can't escape me, simpson -- you're not smart enough!
done and done!
i'm turning you into your costumes!
but what will junkies do drugs under?
whoa, sir, we're dismantling this ride. it's not safe.
robusto is not for sale! but would you like to buy my last dumbbell?
our tandem bicycle! when i bought it, you said you'd ride with me.
i'd love to! i'll be right... wait... are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
awww. i'll be right down.
don't do that... that hurts. careful, careful.
oh no you don't! i just got an idea.
gimme a bottle of bourbon! i got a new liver, and i'm breakin' it in.
where are you two going?
uh-huh. and how will this affect your job at the power plant?
forget about it, homer. she's dead to you now.
oh, marge called you. she said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin.
yeah. she said to shut up, and stop asking questions and listen to moe.
now homer, you gotta keep your head in the game, all right? your first opponent is lefty "the righty" leftwright.
c'mon, homer! we can make it all the way to the quarter-finals for the eastern division, class b, over thirty-five, amateur grouping!
sweet home alabama / where the skies are so blue
i thought it was arm wrestling.
ooh, my little pretty one, my pretty one / when you gonna give me some time, sharona / ooh, you make my motor run, my motor run / got it comin' off o' the line, sharona / never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind / i always get it up for the touch of the younger kind / my, my, my, aye-aye, whoa! /
dad, there's no such thing as "father's day eve."
fine, there's a daddy claus.
bart... lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.
here you go, dad. i hope you like it. i've forgotten what it is.
the unicorns are you and me, dad. i drew it myself. what do you think? huh? huh? pretty heartfelt, huh? huh?
you didn't like it, did you?
oh dad, how could you?
she's not going to get over this quickly -- i know women.
i'm not a baby! a baby is zero to two.
i'd rather not go than lie.
mr. and mrs. simpson, i'm afraid we have a real problem with lisa. your daughter broke a window, upended an ashcan, and hurled a thermos-brand thermos onto the street!
i'm afraid lisa's rage stems from extraordinary disillusionment with a parental figure. in this case, her father.
if i may make a suggestion. the school is looking for a new "safety salamander". when lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender.
uh... he fell asleep in the suit and suffocated.
i guess.
school buses don't have seat belts.
are you a girl? 'cause i don't see a sala-wiener.
ooooh! ahhhh!
janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. couldn't you be that kind of dad?
oh, yeah.
my mother's still in the car.
three cheers for our new hero!
okay, six!
hip, hip hurray! hip, hip hurray!
lincoln was only one man.
look, as the safety salamander, you are beloved by all. and if you were the mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do.
and i will be your campaign manager!
homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that salamander suit. you look like the mascot for some horrible southern college.
mr. simpson, what about those photos of you strangling your child?
i, um, i don't feel so good, blue.
what's that smell?
did you just vomit in that suit?
i'd better wash that thing. it's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
no!
sir, how would you restore our city's crumbling infrastructure?
we're sick of you and your hatchlings!
yeah, i warned you about that.
you don't have a tail anymore.
you're lisa's brother!
sir, you wanna set the baby down? don't worry, i just want to talk.
this is my husband homer.
way to blow our tea, marge. that's the last refrigerator magnet calendar you get from me!
my husband... and my best friend!
we're on food stamps?
for your information, i am now a junior member of the cheery red tomatoes.
oh... uh... uh... bird watching.
grazie. idioto! idioto! idioto! idioto!
i got the combination from burns after i let him feel me up during the depression. zero to the right... zero to the left... back to zero.
i suppose, but you're certainly buxom and flirty.
oh, no jury on earth will convict a bunch of moist-eyed mothers. i'll tell you what, ladies, give me my eggs back and i'll let you go.
simpson!
i just bought a new car. a nice foreign number... the lamborgotti fasterossa.
yes!
sure.
i think dad may blow your cover.
ooh, marriage!
why don't you encourage him to get us some health insurance?
dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?
when mount vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death.
we've passed the ponte vecchio bridge three times. i think we're lost.
mozzarella! parmigiano! provolone! pecorino! gorgonzola! fontina! tallegio! bocconcini!
it doesn't cover mortadella.
maybe there's a mechanic in this tuscan village.
scusi?
hey, she says the mayor speaks english.
how did you wind up here?
my tale begins after i had once again attempted to murder bart...
this is my bride, francesca, and my son, gino.
bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?
and literature is filled with tales of redemption, from jean valjean to the voice of buzz lightyear, tim allen.
dad, don't act like mussolini!
here's a cute fact. this sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.
where is my roadster? you were due back a month ago!
sideshow bob! dad, you're driving on an ancient roman aqueduct!
hey, krusty's in an opera, here in rome! he can save our lives! come on, let's go!
tell ya what, put on these costumes, go on the stage and mix in with the crowd scenes. he won't kill ya in front of all those witnesses.
that's sideshow bob!
when a wife looks like that / and her husband's so fat, that's amore! / when she kisses that jerk / while i do all the work / that's a...
where's reverend lovejoy? he's never been late for christmas service.
now there's no one to deliver the sermon!
that's not my decision!
ohhh...!
it's not over, it's just intermission!
merry christmas, homie. i think you're really gonna like this.
so tell us, what's next for william h. macy?
homie, what's wrong? did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?
can i help you?
i'd be delighted. but i must warn you, i don't wear a sweater every day.
those are raisins.
and this is the lady in my life.
indeed i do. i loved a real woman a long time ago but uh... it didn't work out.
listeners? i thought you worked for a newspaper.
wha...?
dear god. i always dreamed this day would come. and now that it's here, there are so many feelings... i -- i...
homie, you just met this british man. it's too soon to get so emotionally invested.
and now that treasure is somewhere down there.
this guy.
today i'm filled with joy: searching for treasure with my long-lost son. my dream for each of you is that you find the happiness i feel today.
these waters contain some of mother nature's most stunning creatures.
how do i talk? push this button here? you're all losers!
aw... it's beautiful. homer, on your wedding day, i want you to have this. it may not be much, but it's all i've got.
i gave you everything and it still wasn't enough.
well homer, now that you're alive again, i'll leave you with your real family.
of course.
i switched the names on the dna samples. then i put my name first on the list for a new heart. my old one's fine, but ya never know.
it would be my pleasure... son.
anything, son.
all right, nap time.
hey, check it out -- i made it partially risqué.
dad, if you take me to vegas, i'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack.
what's your system?
it seems he was our problem before. your son's on the no-fly list.
dad, neither of us wanna go. why are you doing this? where's the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose?
fight back, fun homer! together we can win!
c'mon, dad, we got a long way to go. you can't stay mad at me the whole time.
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i'm good at.
did you see that? they were eating melon for breakfast!
well dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame.
well, i guess it's tinkle time.
so, here for a snack before they roll you back into the ocean?
what?! no one dashie-dine on stavros!
hm, if i save you, what are you gonna do to me?
dad, i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer.
well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, i wouldn't be so screwed up.
don't gamble on my love, homer!
i've learned so much in my three hours here. i don't have to play pranks to feel good. i can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.
dad?
i'm gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!
homer, i hope you get this. i'm in jail and i need ten thousand dollars bail. hurry!
well, tell your regular bully. he won't like it one bit.
sir, your go-cart's damaged.
well, let's see... oh, to have me shack rebuilt / get my rotten teeth all drill't / something on underneath me kilt / oh, wouldn't it be adequate? / matching shoes for both me feet / dining on untainted meat / a toilet what still has its seat /
of course, but how?
well, what have i got to lose, besides the factory that's been in my family for generations?
homie, what's that?
on the back of your head.
and where should it not go?
dad, get your own song.
i'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
what are those doing there?
it's so impressive.
that was two firemen, a crane and snow white.
well, we better start looking.
i'll stay with you, dad.
one day, while i was savoring the exclusivity--
yeah -- it's like the play within a play in "hamlet."
let's see... it's like when you watch old home movies of you watching tv.
scavengers... scavenge!
i'm a little busy. can i do it later?
but on the upside, i found some cave paintings and made them awesome. 
aw geez.
mr. burns got his plant back, and i like to think i found a shred of humanity in his withered soul. aw dad, did my story make you cry?
oh the yellow gold of texas / is what i wanna save / i will not pay no taxes / if i hide it in a cave
i need an operation?
why does god always need money?
how can you be sure?
there, there... the fact that you tried means everything.
hey marge, i don't i don't really want a computer. you know all those complete strangers googling each other. makes my flesh crawl.
let's do it again!
¡ay, el mundo es loco!
maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the s.a.t.: "snuggles and tickles."
hey homer! sneakin' kisses from the missus?
dad, mom's over at the flanders', babysitting nimrod and nimtodd. we wanna do something.
this is much sadder than i expected.
cheer up, toot-toot. have some of my ice cream.
help! she's grooming me! she's grooming me!
i'm afraid there's nothing we can do now. a chimp that size could tear your son's head right off.
i didn't say that.
i could never think something that horrible.
dad, you can't keep this up for long.
whoa! this oreo is rank.
maybe there's another way to solve this. bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for toot-toot.
while you were living the glamorous life of a tv chimp, i was raising my son. you have no right to take him away from me now. please, please, give me back my boy.
hey, i know how we can save bart.
maybe he's getting married!
that's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
i've never seen a picture so highly defined!
you don't mean that literally, of course.
mom didn't say anything about high-def!
and bodell jenks the third crashes into bodell jenks! the winner is, bodell jenks junior!
beat it! this is my alone time!
i ain't fallin' for that again.
homie, i've been thinking. we have been using this tv for a long time. so i entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen tv.
congratulations, mr. simpson. you've won!
no. no one wins that. you won third prize: a tour of the fox network in los angeles, california.
ooh, why look, there's dan castellaneta from the tracey ullman show.
please don't lean out of the tram, sir, you might get hurt.
not so fast. are you sure you want your most intimate moments broadcast across the country?
what are you doing, homer?
well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives.
i got my tenure at twenty-eight.
you can call me charlie. but do not call me late when there are scones about. little british humor.
i don't understand, dad. our family has so many flaws. why must we share them with the world?
but dad...
forget it.
well, i thought there was no further way i could humiliate my husband. and then this opportunity came along.
you know, i despise my husband.
charles hasn't satisfied me in years.
cruel, dusty years!
homie, i missed you so much! put your pants back on.
where is she? where is the soul-sucking she-beast i call "sweetums?"
you're leaving me for him?!
what brought us together is how much we hate you.
and that's not your strong suit, big guy.
homie, you've been down here for a week, i really think you need- what the hellmann's real mayonnaise?!
it's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
i am never coming back to this city -- and neither is the league!
homie, you should give your dad a call. you can't stay mad at him forever.
no! wait! wait! bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!
hell, yeah!
grampa simpson's movements are tentative. as if he is distracted. distracted as if by a moral dilemma. a moral dilemma posed by a young boy... no, a girl! a girl named linda... no, lisa! the flutter of the cape tells all.
however, federal law requires i keep one union worker on the payroll. so congratulations, whoever catches this bouquet.
you've been transferred to india!?
luxury? this thermostat is just painted on.
aw dad, we'll miss you so much.
homie, i got you something to read on the plane.
it's a book about management, and lee iacocca says it's "definitely, dot dot dot useful."
hello?
calm down, dad. what happened?
yes, oh, you must be mr. homer!
classic. now, tell them how to run a nuclear plant!
dad, i've gotta write a report on the great lakes.
also, i can't sleep at night 'cause there's this new bully who follows me home and... i think he's in the house!
i see what you're saying. we're crowding your plate. in fact, there's no need for us to be here at all. let's go, smithers.
now if you'll excuse me, i'm late for a dinner engagement. i don't want my scooped-out monkey head to get cold.
actually, in our system of belief, there are many gods.
a-bom-shabai! a-bom-shabai! a-bom-shabai! a-bom-shabai!
oh yeah? what's mom's birthday?
it's may!
i'm proud of you, dad. you're the first man to ever outsource the american worker's sense of entitlement and privilege.
he was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
what about this swordfish?
finally, we shall bid goodbye to england and its drunken, decadent sinners.
mother, we must protect him. look, he's praying.
and i will make thee a hat from construction paper!
i see you met our devout leader, ned flandish.
now i gotta warn ya, even for this day and age, i'm considered a bad husband.
well, i'm sure the way to win her heart is to be fat and crying.
perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
homer, i can't believe i was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!
witch! witch! witch!
they're looking at me 'cause i have the key to the stocks.
at least i'm pitching!
in your face, julio. i'll be fetchin' yer food right away. six more games.
hey, you schmuck -- get off-a me! goin' out with a sight gag. nice.
lord, with you watching over me i shall feel no pain. 
homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!
i've tied it off. you're all going to make it. tell the world... that i saved you all.
dad, taking the family to opening night is the nicest thing you've ever done for us.
i can't wait to see this re-imagining of itchy and scratchy... by avant-garde director juliana krellner!
and dynamite igniting!
well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper.
um... i-i think a woman came up with nylon stockings. i mean, probably. we certainly use them.
mom, i don't think this will fool anybody.
he's one of bart's friends.
i don't know. i'm still frowny with you. do you really think women are mentally inferior?
well, then we're gonna leave you one digit short.
dad, all you had to do was paint one number. now no one's gonna be able to find our house.
hey sal bando, give him a '74 a's "thank you honk."
oh, no problem -- i'll just ship these juicy mail-order steaks back to omaha.
dad, isn't it wrong to open or eat other people's mail?
oh dad, no one can rationalize like you.
this is kent brockman, in the springfield keys, reporting to you from the middle of a hurricane! the lid from my coffee cup is long gone. i'm scared, people. truly scared.
it's hard to say. with retrograde amnesia such as this, the patient can forget years and years of her life. you just have to keep jogging her memory till it works.
i didn't say you should be jogging.
although you should be jogging.
oh, you're sweet. i'm lucky to have such a kind... uncle?
but you're so much more... ravaged than i am.
i may have lost my memory, but i'm not an idiot.
oh it's great. like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
you strangle your child?
who are those freaks?
i know what the sun is.
it's so great to have my children back.
nope. i'm sorry, admiral, but you're still a stranger to me.
what's snuggling?
mr. simpson, i don't even know you -- i'm not making love with you!
you're describing how to parallel park.
we've got to tell dad!
that homer simpson / he's quite a guy / he paid me ten bucks / so i would lie / the truth is / he's not so great / he is the one man / i tru-ly hate...
i've had a lovely evening, mr. simpson.
know what? no! i'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
that sounds horrible!
my grades will suffer! in fact, they're already suffering. look at this garden of f's. you planted them all!
that works for hiccups, not amnesia.
how long you gonna be bunking with me, son?
don't answer it yet -- savor the sound.
go on.
dude, she's got three kids.
you drink?
i remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
oh, and her.
uh-huh. and him.
i don't recognize that name.
oh, i know all them!
oh, i always liked that guy!
oh, and there's a familiar name. and another one. wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? did he get married?
i just had my first kiss.
weaving?! homer, you're my father, you're supposed to protect me from things like this!
not if i spend the whole time running around like this. die, weapons, die!
wait, wait, ho-hold the phone there homer...
yaaay!
imax 3-d films presents: "nunchucks: cool but useless." the nunchuck was invented thousands of years ago by a chinese monk. artifacts of the time indicate that this incident was hilarious.
so, according to creationism, there were no cavemen.
dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?
why, i believe right now this gentleman's havin' dinner with the tooth fairy and the easter bunny.
now, bambi, who started that forest fire that killed your mama? evolution? my, my, my.
don't worry lisa, i've got the answer to your problems right here. look, homie, i brought you a beer.
as sure as i am that jesus hates hip hop!
as a matter... homer...
this court hereby rules that the law forbidding the teaching of evolution is repealed.
homer, we need those tickets to get in!
i concur!
homer? homer? now we have to kiss. the big tv is telling us to!
give me a kiss, homie.
hey, that was my iced tea. i just sweetened it to my liking!
evenin', ma'am. i uh... couldn't help seein' you two exchanging marital kisses tonight.
i was wonderin' if you and the mister could give us some marriage counseling. ya know uh, in return, i can give you season tickets.
homer, can i see you in the kitchen?
well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life.
that's what i want -- carefree intimacy, with no edge of resentment!
buck, tabitha, welcome. we'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as homer gets here.
well, i'm an old-fashioned guy you know, and when we got hitched, i just assumed she'd give up her international recording career to focus on my minor-league baseball dreams.
maybe we should stop here.
uh yeah, sure.
isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? they're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now.
this house is spectacular. you must have had a great view of the riots!
oooh.
i always say that.
hey, why don't you stay and have a bite?
oh homer, you're sweet, but... oh, you're talking to the chicken.
homer simpson! you're supposed to be my marriage counselor. i did workbook pages for you!
there ain't gonna be a three o'clock.
dad, because you and mom screwed up buck mitchell's marriage, some kids beat me up at school today.
oh, papa.
then i guess you'll do it without me.
where are you, sweetie?
well, homer, it looks like my marriage is going into extra innings.
no problem.
homer!
you said you meant to make brownies. any other lies?
oh michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower.
with fat tony doin' the morphine mambo, the calabresis are gonna try to put him down for a dirt nap.
i don't know what to do.
well, what do you know about being a mob boss?
this guy in here owes us money.
look mister, i-i-i don't got the cash. my clientele -- they're all bums. they never pay!
look, all-all-all i got is twenty-five. i swear! i swear!
homer, where did you get that truck?
homer, helen lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. could you pick it up?
dad, you want i should plug him in the ankle?
i'm sorry. i just can't live with myself, seeing you this way.
i'm afraid not.
and i can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.
someone poisoned these meatballs. homer...?
oh dear. dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
he's just drumming louder!
is it in a safe neighborhood? just make it happen!
i was jamming with skinny turner and marbles le marquez! and they want me to join their trio!
bart, a rising star like you needs a manager, and gil's your guy! oh, i'm a jazz daddy from way back...with the skit-skat skittily boom-de-boom, and the ding-dong daddy... is that jazz? that's jazz, right? cha-cha-cha with the curly fries!
okay, guys. no one knows you're here, so be quiet. and if you get hungry, there are rats living in the christmas decorations.
i feel so terrible. i just wanted to save those animals while bart became a drummer... but i never thought the two stories would intersect.
do you have an idea?
how you doing, bro? we've got the latest by nabil -- "uma shang shang -- the flower song!" uma shang shang / uma shang shang / uma shang shang. is like eh, bruce springsteen the boss. ya?
if you buy now, i give you tooth ache cream. tooth ache cream.
uh, that candy's been here an awfully long time. i'd think twice if i were you.
well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse.
"wisconsin from above," "veterans' day parades," ooh, "smiles of ireland"! redheaded twins? their mother must have her hands full!
well, i like the idea of you as a handyman... and i love the idea of you reading!
homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?
it's so unfair -- i'm as handy as any man.
i guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing. homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!
superlative! please install a doggie door sized for a teacup poodle.
i'm terribly sorry. i thought i heard the sound of a woman measuring.
a dash of glue, a turn of screw, and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two -- or more! uh-oh, switch!
mm-hmm! simpson, you're a master craftsman.
why did my hypothetical scenario scare you so?
this is shirley. yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. goodbye!
why does lenny need a windmill anyway?
and to think you built this whole thing with your own two hands.
homer, it's time people knew the truth: i'm doing the work and i want the credit.
mr. simpson, shouldn't we begin by securing the struts?
let's go home.
dad, here's a thought: if you just gave mom credit, maybe she could help you.
i'd like a daddy who lived in the real world.
your father's finally gonna get exposed as the credit-stealing fraud he is! perfect.
dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!
oh my god, he'll kill himself! he'll never hear me say "i told you so!"
homer, i was pretty upset with you, but in the end, i... i... i-beam!
look! a shooting star!
dad, no! it could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!
how could you eat that goo? you don't know what galaxy it's from!
dad?
homer! you won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?
the flames are sealing in my juices!
tell my friends i died kissing a girl!
what did we germans ever do to deserve this? oh, right.
i like big guts and i cannot lie / double chins with the chafing thighs / when a dude walks in with the hanging jowls, and my stomach starts to growl / i'm gettin' hungry / so i masticate / chomping on the overweight / i eat fat people for days / like potato chips by lay's / try to eat just one, but it can't be done / i've got to eat a ton / baby likes fat / baby likes fat
you've got a weight problem, and you know it.
aren't you?
homer, your family's here. and you gotta help me help them help you help me help you.
i have to be honest with you -- i can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.
food does not equal love!
it worked! now, there's something i've wanted to do for a long time. can't you read my writing? i didn't say kick homer's "walls".
the cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
just write a scroll, asking him to stop.
astronomers say the ominous capsules originated from earth's closest neighbor...
mars!
you know, homer, we haven't actually seen these aliens.
dad! a flying saucer blew up that statue!
okay mr. simpson, we'll tear up your son's contract.
sounds uh, like you're kind of tired of being bossed around at home.
would you be interested in, um... i don't know, joining the army?
hey, a big target like you will be home a lot sooner than that.
homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home.
at-ten-tion! ordinarily i would spend the next two hours questioning your sexuality, running down your hometowns, and telling you to drop and give me various numbers.
here's your nicknames: brooklyn, hollywood, kissimmee-st. cloud florida, maverick, blanket hog, newman's own, master of suspense, england's rose, nickname pending, bram stoker's dracula, and snowflake...
a troublemaker, huh? you're gonna sit here and eat donuts, while the rest of the unit does push-ups.
well, thank you.
frontline infantry!
gentlemen, i'll be frank. never before has the army accepted recruits with test scores as low as yours.
i'm not handing out medals. but i am gonna give you a special assignment. the army is conducting war games and we want you to play the enemy.
stay crunchy in milk!
oh. guess i'd better do my part.
that's how it works? i was just drawin' wangs on the numbers.
the salvation army? you got it.
hey! they's usin' live ammo!
that was our last christmas card.
i'd give anything to hear homer's voice.
it's not giant and it's not in the distance! it's small and it's in our room!
i wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.
homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives.
dear pus bag...
thanks. so here's my digs.
thanks, homer. i love ya, man.
i don't care about my grade. i'm gonna send moe's poem to "american poetry perspectives."
homer, don't drink and drive!
lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! we're going vermonting!
that was my house, you moron!
lisa, if you could just forgive me, you would make me the happiest man in vermont. except for those two dudes i saw gettin' hitched. not my thing, but i wish 'em well.
homer, would it make you feel better if any of that hit me?
so what? that's legal in rolo-polo!
if you want to keep your job, then you better start... ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba... you're thinking about that ice cream truck, aren't you? well, you can just forget about... come and lick me, big boy! i said lick me!
homer, there you are! what does my best customer want today?
i wish i had more customers like you. i'm barely scraping by.
...ninety-nine-fifty... ninety-nine-seventy-five...
oh, yes! max loved to talk about his work. how he bored me. and now i'm left with nothing but my lover and this worthless truck.
you'll buy max's truck?
how can we forget? mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
otto, you totally pimped dad's ride!
i'm a unitard!
i do, but i'm lactose-intolerant.
but my doctor says that i...
call the number on my bracelet.
that's right, tell me all your little wooden dreams. you're not alone any more. no you ain't. aw, you're shivering, are you cold? where you goin', marge?
homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. i'm as hopeful and full of life as i was in the years before i met you.
well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
hey, i do more than tv. i had a one-man show on broadway. that's who showed up -- one man! long story short, i won a drama desk award.
the show starts at three. you promise you'll be here?
hey, give me one of everything! hey!
already? it's only thirty-eight seconds to three.
see, statements like that are why people think we're gay.
oh, stop. just stop. you don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!
mom! mom!
there's mom!
homer, i wanna show the world how i feel about you.
now i know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
you're the worst husband in the world!
don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle. dear lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy.
why?
look at our kids! playin' like champs!
homie... when you're done putting lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day.
dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?
oh dad, i'm tired. we'll read more tomorrow.
no! we have to read it together.
you must read ahead. fiction is your passion!
just read the book, you shaved ape.
greystash.
c'mon dad, read the last chapter! everyone says there's a big surprise -- i bet angelica discovers that she's a wizard!
come on, read, read!
why are you stopping? we're almost at the happy ending!
is that really how it ends? what happened to the merlinical council?
dad, you can read to me anytime.
gee, you're really upset about this greystash thing.
homer, it's just a book.
grumply, grumply groo, i'll throw my net over you!
come on, homer, let's get the kids out of here. homer?
yeah! maybe i should spend the night here, too.
but i haven't given you a present.
grumply, grumply groo, your blood will make my stew!
i'll tell you why: christian charity.
i promise you, he'll leave after today.
i will.
wait, you don't have a place to live?
i guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
he's still in need, we have to let him stay. it's what dr. king would want us to do.
please, just a few more days.
what'sa matter, homer? do you still miss the upn?
well, you can't kick him out, 'cause then marge will never learn to assert herself.
homie, wake up! i rented that negligee you like.
homer, don't forget it's valentine's day! whatcha gettin' the mrs.?
mccarthy pumps the old bassoon while i the pipes do play / and henessee tennessee tootles the flute and the music is somethin' grand... a credit to old ireland/ is macnamara's band.
i'll tell you what. we're going to scottsdale!
sure!
there he is! 
i don't care how successful gil is, he's still a mooch, and i need to tell him off!
ooh, this is one of our trips to barnacle bay! we used to rent a beach house there every summer. i was so happy on that island...
this was my favorite seahorse. i called him mr. funnygoodfeeling... oh god, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!
dip your berries? / powder your jellies?
homer, that's too much sugar!
excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. what happened?
no, no, it was long before him.
i guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember.
can i go again?
aaahhh!
well, at least they left your underwear on. that was nice of them.
i say let him fish it off. these waters are so barren, by the time he pays the debt, he'll be as old and as queer as i am!
no, you don't eat it. its oil is used to polish stripper poles.
wait, this is bait! homer, i told you to beer batter the shrimp and bait the hooks. did you do the opposite?
it's not opposite day!
it's not opposite day! the yum-yum fish! they're back! we're gonna be rich! and it's all thanks to you, homer! or should i say... chief fish clubber homer!
dad... i couldn't stay with mom and lisa while you were out here.
they were gonna go to the folk art museum, then they were gonna paint crab shells. not crush them, paint them.
we're still gonna make it, aren't we dad?
absolutely. bart, the sea wouldn't dare take the life of an apple-cheeked young lad like yourself.
in about two seconds.
we'll never know how that brave crew spent their final moments. maybe a boiler blew up, sheared their faces clean off. all we do know is they're in heaven now, hanging their lines off a cloud, and fishin' for airplanes.
how did you make it?
welcome, homer, to our watery realm.
lot of garbage fish today.
chill thunder! "chill thunder"!
outta my way, ya seatbelt wearin' cowards!
homer, no! revenge never solves anything.
you're under arrest for treason!
tell it to le baton!
i sentence you to life...
hey wait, did you guys hear that? he just admitted it! guys? oh man, this place is so unfair.
you're the traitor.
perhaps i may be of help.
i'm your cellmate. you never noticed me, because, frankly, you're extremely self-centered.
young man, i have the answer to your problems. i spent thirty years digging this tunnel, but now i can't use it. i'm simply too old.
well, because before my wretched life comes to a close, i want to know that i had one friend. also, because while you slept, i violated you repeatedly.
when we meet the count, do you think he'll like us? / i've heard rumors he's mysterious!
i've heard about these things. they're good for doin' the wife, right?
ma?...
homer...
papa meaux! papa meaux!
we were together for five years! now who's gonna take care of the triplets?
for me, huh? what took you so long?
dad, wait, i've got a story about why revenge is wrong.
the point, dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm.
look at that view. it reminds me how insignificant we are in the world. yee haw!
dad, wait! you haven't heard my story.
hand over your wallet!
shut up!
so you see, revenge is great. and there's three ways to talk about it. although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a halloween story...
yeah. it turns out we have a lot in common. we're both from connecticut! look at all them stars. how many do you think there are?
tomorrow's multicultural day at school.
aw, grampa. we should take lots of pictures of him while we still can.
homer, is that you?!
and that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? they had seven names for that.
well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked.
hey, guys. i'll see you in a bit. i entered a thousand mile baja road race.
hello?
oh, man! what now?
i'm bart simpson, who the hell are you? oh, right. darcy.
what? not you, fibbing bear!
i just found this note in bart's room! "dear mom and dad: me and my girlfriend darcy have gone to utah to get married. f.y.i., she's pregnant"!
i did!
"dingle's berries" in provo, utah?
our daughter says she's run off with your son!
no!
you know, i thought darcy and i would be like a real married couple. instead we just ended up fighting all the time.
aww. and someday you'll be one too.
homer is so amazing! he can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.
i can't believe it. homer simpson... a bloody millionaire!
wheee! /
what are you people doing in my summer home?
i am an angry rich man!
oh fah-ther, my pony buttercup can jump ever so high-- hoo-boy, it's mr. burns.
then i just want to know why your husband did what he did.
at bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. and you know what? no monsters have gotten me yet.
homer! don't kill the foreign man!
i overslept! the family can't start the day without me!
homie, you woke up early?
and... my dad never takes me on the merry-go-booger. he's always passed out in the parking snot.
dad, those kids aren't dumb. this show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!
this basement is a wonderful gift to the family. but how could you afford it?
mr. simpson, do you understand how bankruptcy works?
mr. simpson, among the expenses the court deems frivolous: you throw over one thousand dollars a month into local wishing wells.
uh-huh. well you're going to have to make some serious cutbacks to your expenses. three subscriptions to "vanity fair?"
shut up! it's an instructional website! shut up!
i don't wanna leave! you promised me i could die here!
can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
for some reason, she doesn't trust him. maybe it's the bang-up job he did raising you.
all right, lips, man your kissing stations! this is not a drill!
i'm selma.
ah, the hell with you. i just might ask that selma girl out. and you can't tell me not to! my roof, my rules!
be nice, homer. don't you see how great it is that they found each other? like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog.
well gee, homer, you uh, ain't exactly open-casket material yourself.
it's me -- patty.
hello, homer.
relax, it's just me, patty. do you have your disguise?
what the hell is going on here?
homer! why would you try to break us up?
homer, say hello to your new maw! 
dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!
oh, i don't know, he might come home any minute.
i don't think we're doing this right.
no, dad, they're the opposite.
it's okay, homie. you're probably just tired from not doing anything all day.
you could buy a fireproof safe.
sir, we've been here six times this month.
it's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. so i made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation.
i picked my malibu stacy hybrid convertible. it runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
oh man. i thought i was strong enough to get through this again -- but i'm not.
bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
this is good. real good! like lindsay lohan looking drunk, high and bony. click, click, career over, see ya in the gutter, freckles. homer, i'll pay ya two hundred bucks. bring me more snaps like this, and i'll make you a moderately wealthy man!
wheeee -- i'm sort of rich! i can rent anything i want!
sure, why not?
your head dinged my door panel. jerks like you oughtta be shot!
ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
c'mon, baby -- barf for mama.
hello, homer. have you lost weight?
tell me, how's maggie?
dad! it's drederick tatum. try to get him to punch you.
yes, how can i help you, my handsome friend?
okay, here we go. that's what i think of the fourth estate!
nobility, clergy and commoners. learn your french history!
it's eleven at night and i can't get to sleep!
okay. 
well, i do like the extra money. but i think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes.
okay, this is the place.
do you, rainier luftwaffe wolfcastle, take maria shriver-kennedy-quimby to be your lawful wedded--
smile!
sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. it's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine.
and my sister once saw burt reynolds at an airport, and he wouldn't even co-sign her mortgage.
celebrities: hide your shame! what are you going to do with those photos?
moving on, our class trip to italy is now spaghetti night at papa john's, and your fifteen-hundred dollar deposits will not be refunded.
sunny? i never have to look out the window again! paper towels for sixty-nine cents... sixty-eight cents... sixty-six cents! kids, get in the car! we're going to pennsylvania! six hundred twenty-nine thousand results. wow! and all this time i thought "googling yourself" meant the other thing. it's our house! but what's that thing? everyone can see you! get inside!
just put on a towel!
you already promised you would.
he quit! being a ref is a thankless job... the parents hate ya... the only upside is the kids share their snack with you.
dad, where'd you get that outfit?
that was my father!
dad, i'm impressed! you've become a much better referee.
i'm a spectator addressing a player, answer me!
helen, please. don't drop the "j" bomb.
ow! she tripped me. ow! owww!
how about a lecture from me -- ronaldo?
you heard geraldo. what's it gonna be?
you can't give me a yellow card?! you're my father!
this is what i think of your yellow card!
big if!
wanna go slam a few beers?
what'sa matter, homer and bart?
gee moe, you give great advice.
no.
you were right to kick me out of that game. soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of europe and south america.
so from now on i'll play soccer for the same reason i study chemistry -- for fun! do you want to play a little?
i hogged it! i hogged it!
unless you're serving me a cold beer, you keep moving.
uh-uh. my wife's lookin' for a bathing suit that doesn't make her look "horsey". so, i'm gonna be here a while.
wow, this is soft...
what in the name of-- hey, you!
that's the best endorsement i've heard since mickey mantle for maypo! i'll take five mattresses.
you do now, son! you're hired!
all this fuss for a baseball game? why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?
i put on fresh makeup for this?
was there even a baseball game yesterday? i don't remember!
don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?
yes, i need to be able to sleep through my wife's nagging, and my eight horrible babies and the anguished howls of my ancestors.
homer, we have a friend -- actually, a friend of a friend--
oooh, sold!
we're here about the mattress.
we tried raising cain but we weren't able.
i know the mechanics of lovemaking, homer! you owe us a refund!
well, maybe if you go...
i'm sorry, homie -- i want to snuggle, but i'm just not feeling it.
you traded our mattress? i had my secret cash in it!
every day, every day, every day, yay, yay... yay!
homer, stop that.
how dare you break into our house, defile our bed, and smash our family photos with your foot.
well, i am reminded of the story of wise king solomon.
i wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.
where's your father with those pacifiers?
larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt?
are you counting sheep all night long?
homer, i think you dominoed this.
i've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken ambien -- i mean nappien. see? "may cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."
mr. simpson, why did you hurt the dollies?
but users are losers.
why don't you just quit taking the pills, you hophead?
no, play!
and that's only one of the cool things we're gonna do with him...
c'mon, just one more.
you've horribly injured the whole fire department!
sweetheart, come to dinner.
that's the fire siren!
just come back alive, okay?
hey, this is sweet, huh? almost makes up for not gettin' paid.
oooh, leather arms! people just give you this stuff?
no, no, no, the complete "munsters" on dvd!
i can't believe he acted completely in character.
gentlemen, i'd like to thank you. you've saved my store.
oh my, i didn't think the damage was that bad. but you must be telling the truth -- you're firemen, after all.
uh, gentlemen... i'm uh... i'm starting to wonder if we've crossed a line here.
just let the chemicals deal with it.
well, uh...
you should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. kids, get in here and show your father the faces!
are you crazy? it's five hundred degrees in here! oh no, wait, it's only four ninety-five. what's on your mind?
what'd you do with all the loot?
this winning cornucopia is magnificent. styrofoam?
dad, look, a corn maze!
maybe we should split up.
no, no, i didn't mean--
i was talking about--
now there must be a way out!
that was never my plan.
eat some corn!
this maze is too hard for me.
please, can he?
i can't believe it. my own dog bit me.
homer!
i don't want a new dog. i want my old dog, the one who bit me.
that's because i soaked him in slime!
homer, can you breathe?!
whoa, this is the source of the stench!
vile curd! simpson, you can take your putrid mess far out of my sight, you songless land-whale!
i'm bulking up for football.
okay, this might hurt a little. no problem. oh, sweet mother of mary!
well, the school's having a bake sale.
so true.
i gave you ten dollars.
well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
yes there is!
dad, that's a bomb!
yeah, dad.
make room for jumbo.
nothing.
praise the lord.
bart's makin' faces, dad.
oh bart, you fall for that every six months.
you're going to the dentist too, dad.
mr. simpson, have you been flossing regularly?
i haven't started yet.
don't worry, sweetie -- i'm sure that man has some special tooth problem.
this film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. mixed signals, hmm.
dad, that's ludicrous!
i can't wait to get the freshness out of my mouth!
it's a sundae that's fun.
cup or cone?
congratulations! you just purchased the one millionth ice-cream cone sold by this store!
tonight on smartline, a provocative discussion of the middle east... will not be featured. instead, we'll be talking to a man who bought an ice-cream cone.
of course that has nothing to do with the fact that this station and the ice-cream company are owned by the same corporation... but i digress. all right, let's just get through this. uh, mr. simpson, tell us how it felt when you bought the fateful treat.
no one saw my show... so no one heard my filthy faux pas! my career is safe!
uh... hey look, it's the airport bus. you should get on it.
that's because you're sitting on me, you lummox!
i invited him to stay with us for a few days. his career is ruined, and i was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide.
you'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of fox news.
we have to take in mr. brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
this is fox news with the latest liberal outrage. it seems liberals want to give nasa the right to "abort" space missions whenever they feel like it.
one thing i've always wondered: how can fox news be so conservative, when the fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? they don't fit together.
liberals hate families...
and swear like a lumberjack who hacked off a leg. let's do it!
of course. gosh, dad, your hands are shaking!
...entertaining america with hits like "house," "american idol" and "american idol results show."
i guess this is the end. i just wish i'd spent more time at the office.
...me!
hey dad, have fun with your boyfriend.
so simpson, i hear you like pizza pie.
chicago, eh? well what if i took us there now?
and just so you know, she'll do anything for you. anything except sex. and i do mean anything.
sure, i guess. hey you, beer me / beer me for always, that's the way it should be / hey you, beer me / beer us together, naturally
we'll be back before you know it.
nice job -- where do i apply? now i need a location.
i heard "a starbucks... in siberia!" finally, an emotion.
homer, you smell like chicago. did you fly there on a commercial airline?
wow. is it much different from a normal plane?
homie, what's wrong?
hi, dad.
this is colby krause. i hired him to help you improve your life. he'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
i'm a life coach.
the first step in self-improvement is to take a thorough look at your life.
is uncle fester still alive?
homer, before you even head out the door in the morning, you're already a loser.
homer, your journey downstairs would've been a lot safer if you'd remembered the n.d.c.'s of concentration: never don't concentrate.
homer, you're up!
homer, here in the bowling alley, you're a totally different man: relaxed, confident...
that's not my name.
homer, your shoe attitude is bowling people over. these are letters from companies interested in interviewing you!
this one.
they need a safety inspector to fly between their north american plants.
we're all so proud of you, sweetie.
well, with a coffee you can stay till lunch. then you have to order a solid.
they're all the same maze.
so, how was your first day at your new job?
why aren't you at your new job?
you sure know how to repeat the joke i just told ya. but as a formality i must ask: do you know anything about copper tubing?
no.
leave your resume with cheryl!
but dad, you've gotta tell her. she's been buying brand-name groceries.
hello?
it's bad news, isn't it? i should never get my hopes up. nothing ever works out for us.
really?
uh, did you just say "semper fudge"?
look at this business center -- fax, wi-fi, teleconferencing capabilities... i'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!
sweetheart, what do you mean?
what was that?
all right, homer. what is it you're attempting to do? win over a difficult client?
homer, i've gotta tell you, i'm not very good. i went to the harvard of the south.
not duke.
okay, homer. i don't know anything about planes, but i know about you. you have what made america great: no understanding of the limits of your power, and a complete lack of concern for what anyone thinks of you. so you'll land that plane. and do you know why? because i heard some guy say you couldn't.
and at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
this concludes our service. go now in the peace of the lord.
we left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!
dad, all you circled were the "i's" and "a's".
be my guest.
every place has such a long line.
there's a place -- with no line!
bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house.
oh homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus.
it must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
um, listen, i'm outta town next week, so...
excuse me. my brother twisted his ankle setting up the chairs.
please sir, a little respect for the dead.
well, time to move on with our lives.
homer, you have a mild back sprain. and you also ingested a dangerous quantity of grave dirt.
not dirt -- vegetables!
well, young people are my future.
excellent, excellent! the springfield opera house, of which i am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing la bohème. i want you to sing the lead.
places, everyone!
for the last time, it's not a movie!
yeah. but these seats are terrible.
my boy, you are a star!
and you contributed to our culture!
no, no. it's a good thing.
nice set, homer. that was a hot one.
call me p-dingo.
you know, homer, there's one thing about opera that has always bugged me: everyone sings instead of talking. but you made me believe i was in a magical world where singing is talking.
wait, homer, before you go, there's this new note i'm working on. tell me what you think...
you know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage.
excuse us... would you mind signing autographs for my mother and me?
what is he saying?
ay chi-what?
sir, may i say i thoroughly enjoyed your performance.
want us to take marge shopping?
we're trapped. your fans will rip us to pieces.
that's right, i'm a woman!
now listen, homer. you can have me any time you want me.
what is it, sweetie?
she's perfect! for the first time since you became an opera star i can finally relax.
all right, homer. i understand perfectly. you shall never be mine.
dad, i think someone's trying to kill you!
why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?
let's go, hagliacci -- or should i say, madame butterface! what? what? i had two.
goodnight, maggie. come on, sweetie. everyone's going to sleep.
shout!
hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
a little bit louder now!
maggie's so clingy! homer, hold her while i pour the milk!
it's either milk... or paint.
you want milk? i got yer milk right here!
listen up, ya humps! which one of yaz parked at the bank? 'cause they're towin' yer sorry ass.
i'll tell you what. i'll give you a ride to the impound lot.
well, he's in this truck right now.
no, ya dumb dominic. i'm my own boss.
i don't call in sick -- i work when i want to.
...and lasso the street cattle.
my blow better still be in the glove box.
you know... if you're interested... we could use another hook jockey. the springfield territory's wide open, since flatbed fred got killed in that murder-murder-murder-suicide.
for five hundred bucks, i'll sell ya this old bucket.
not to worry. these are the ones you show at home.
now just remember two rules... one, stick to springfield. if i catch you on my turf, i'll rip off your head, vomit down your neck, pull out your heart, show it to your head, then shove 'em both down your neck hole, to which i previously alluded.
rule two, always keep your hook pointed out.
stop! stop! i'm entitled to park there.
what the hell are you doing?!
with those jerks out of the way, i was able to park right outside!
maggie, what can i get you for breakfas-- oh. you did everything yourself. homer, where have you been?
i don't want to live like that.
well, no one's disputing that.
so it is! i'm just here to pay the fine for the sunday school bus. you towed it with the kids still in it!
you know what they say: "with great power comes great responsibility."
i told you to stay off my turf!
goodbye.
the truth is, we're just waiting for each others' hair to grow so we can braid it.
dad? where are you?
working? where?
you sound weird.
homie! you're all right!
well, i have to look good for tomorrow.
you have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.
homer, you cannot miss lisa's big day. and you have to come sober!
point zero nine.
deal.
and now the reason we're all here today... lisa simpson!
homer! i'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
i just want to go home.
you're disgracing america's pastime. you should be ashamed of yourself... what the...?
you said you visited him every night.
dwight, that was the most unselfish thing i've ever seen. i'm sorry i didn't visit you before.
greetings, two forty-one.
i want you to eliminate this reporter: kent brockman. he found the gully where i dump electricity every summer to jack up prices.
well i won't be home either. i'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains.
ninth floor -- assassin's perch.
uh... a blender cozy. how was your night?
homie, i made you my "killer" lasagna.
you're a killer for hire!
how could you not tell me you were an assassin?
listen, i...
i get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?
all those nights i thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!
stop it! that's my favorite couch!
great. now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will "super dad" be then?
we got a complaint from an anonymous "neighboreeno" about an elaborately-choreographed high-octane ultra-fight. i would have taken a bribe!
i'd like to see you do a guy sometime.
we'll be killing every human in two days / we'll be killing every human in two days / we will cook them / we will eat them / 'cause that's the way to treat them...
open this door at once!
we know it's you, mr. simpson. now where's the alien?
bart... friend?
definitely -- especially if you count the inside flap as part of the cover. it usually gives you a great idea of what the book's about.
excuse me, but this is not good!
perhaps i can be of some assistance. i've got something that will scare the h-e-double sippy straws out of them.
sloth!
there's a bee on maggie!
homer! the wedding's in twenty minutes! just pick a tie!
why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
you don't know what color my eyes are?
no peeking. i'm wai-ting.
no.
little help?
but why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?
and until they do, you can stay here.
then go to moe's!
thanks, mags. i could use a pick-me-up. oh my god. i've become the world's oldest baby. men don't get their moo-moo from a ba-ba! they get their moo-moo from a big-boy cup! i can't be a baby anymore. i'm alone now. i have to be a man! thanks, mags.
oh my god, look at these poll numbers. aye carumba! oh man. milhouse has gone from being a comic figure to a tragic one. if he could go back to being happy, i could go back to being cool.
well, well, look who's strollin' down alzheimer avenue. you used to know everything about that wife of yours. even wrote a song about her.
all right, i get it. you're cool, you're not "mainstream," you wear a porkpie hat...
"rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame".
we have a family.
yep, nothing beats living on "wife-support".
that's why i drive a bentley.
and they're not talking about cars.
as soon as our wives hit it big, they dumped the fat old guys they were with and married us. yes!
here's how you know she's really about to go: your wife seems happy and full of life.
well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed mount everest and got everyone else killed.
that's okay. i don't care that you don't care. go watch your thing.
really? but i'm so used to my old one.
what's gotten into you? i'm going to the successful ladies room!
oh, there's no secret. just hard work...
...exercise two hours a day...
...keep up with the latest fashions...
...and of course, cut out all fatty foods and alcohol.
very well. if you wish, we can perform the procedure in the office, today.
dad, are you okay? i see food on your plate instead of blurring motions.
you had your hot dog plumped?
homie, i'm back!
you also remembered i like flattery!
homie, you look good!
let me get a good look at you!
what are you hiding from me? is it chocolate?
and i'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
you want me to unstaple your stomach?
and so, to honor her success, i bestow upon marge simpson this hundred dollar gift card to sweatpants etcetera.
listen, homer, i gotta be honest with you...
the doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. and i said no. but i did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man i love.
and dad, i hope you learned something from this.
well, maybe i could. but every time i look at you, i see the same adorable boy i fell in love with.
interested in a car stereo?
care to make love, sir?
that'll be fifty cents -- or free, with the purchase of a $200 tivo plus a two-year contract.
sir, your tivo?
oh no we won't! 
howdy, folks! are you tired of family arguments over where to go to dinner?
why not try wes doobner's world famous family style rib huts! the rib joint with something for everyone.
we've got ribs...
we're going to a rest'rant grand op'niiiiiiiing... / but don't fill up on bread!
i see no grill, oven, or food of any kind.
hello, simpsons.
and now you're all going to die -- just because you watched a television commercial!
before you die, perhaps you'd like to know how i engineered my ultimate revenge.
shut up! this time, to liven up my tale, i brought along some visual aides. just call me... slideshow bob!
"the hills have eyes three: the hills still have eyes". and now, the moment we've all been waiting for...
he mocked my folksy ways!
well, i guess the rest of us should pay our respects.
bob planned this from the beginning --
he wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
he would never get a shakespeare quote wrong --
his mother was a shakespearean actress!
...so when bob collapsed in the courtroom...
...his father could take that opportunity to inject bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
it was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!
stop that cremation!
get me outta here. what are you doing? i can't breathe!
well, this time i think sideshow bob is finally locked up for good.
was you ever. you came in sayin' you really needed to forget something, so i mixed you up the most powerful drink i got... the "forget-me-shot."
that means it worked. no one ever remembers. that's why i made this video to explain the process. you start with a splash of jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, triple-sec, quadruple-sec, gunk from a dog's eye, absolut pickle...
why don't you ask the person who filed the complaint? not that i am authorized to release that infor--
fine, it was flanders. now since you know everything, who was jack the ripper?
i had to -- i heard a hubbub, bub.
you come to me for help rememberin'? that's like asking your horse to do your taxes, which i did back in nineteen ninety-eight.
punch that orderly who takes sips out of my juice.
mr. simpson, i have built a device that will enable you to explore your memories. the science was easy, but now i've got the hard part, coming up with a name.
uhh...
hmm...
to me, "nerd" stands for "not even remotely dorky," so thank you. thank you for the compliment. now you'll feel a slight pinch... followed by an extremely painful pinch. signaling that the spike will begin boring into your skull three seconds later.
yes, that's right, boring.
oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way.
another me? you can watch the kids.
you're superior to me in every way!
what is it you want from me? money? weed?
dad, you just destroyed your first kiss.
uh... apu.
duffman!
i'm just givin' it to your wife. she is gonna be sore tomorrow.
good one.
don't worry about our happiness -- for once, think of yourself. 
this magic marker's running out of ink. i'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
oh yeah! duff beer is sponsoring the party, featuring new duff champagne -- the beer of champagnes!
stop, homer! please! my eye!
homie, this is your party!
i've spit in every drink i ever served you. bottoms up!
because i didn't want him finding out about the party. i mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring sarah, and i just don't care for that woman.
you know, there's an after-party at the bottom of the ocean. this is good for two free drinks.
because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee.
we can't leave work till you do!
i hope he's not telling that stupid story about hang gliding again. 
don't you remember what today is?
i'm just really worried about your weight. bart says that we got a call from nasa and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
there, there, cheesy mcmayor. no one likes weepy meat.
this election is on every channel.
i think it's exciting -- springfield is the center of the political universe. i feel like a pundit in a think tank!
but i was in "die hard."
who should america elect in two thousand eight? former governor vincent aleppo said in the new york times, "i will protect the nation from attack."
but in that same issue of the new york times, they also printed an article about terrorist leader nussaf al mustaffi.
and ye shall judge them by the company they keep.
i feel exactly the opposite but the same.
what're we gonna do? we can't not vote. nobody does that!
sorry.
chief wiggum!
roll over, anne coulter, and tell james carville the news: springfield voters have overwhelmingly rejected the major candidates of both parties in favor of a write-in: eight-year-old ralph wiggum. shockingly, this new face is now favored by fifty-three percent of likely voters. a new frontrunner has been crowned!
ow!
the constitution? i'm pretty sure the patriot act killed it to ensure our freedoms.
dad, i'm freezing.
we wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!
we're in every kind of therapy!
the nineties? never heard of it.
unfortunately, as i later learned, that wasn't heroin. it was insulin. homer really did need those injections.
did you two ever get back together?
this is a terrible valentine's day.
and i love you, tootsie roll...
mr. simpson, this damage will take a week to fix. while your car's in the shop, you can drive this loaner.
she's right here.
on the contrary. the loaner car is complimentary. it's standard policy.
okay, so--
whoa, fancy wheels. what song does the horn play?
cut it out!
there's this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.
really, dad?
you're right. i'm gonna go to school tomorrow and show everyone i'm awesome.
no, i'm kind of embarrassed about it.
i never dreamed an american car designed in germany, assembled in mexico from parts made in canada, could be so amazing.
dad?
jeez louise. are you okay?
it's your new diet!
well, i went from fat to "all that" using my simple, foolproof diet. it's all about little substitutions. instead of french toast for breakfast, why not eat a bell pepper? when you crave something sugary, eat a bell pepper. want a beer? bell pepper!
bell peppers! pipin' cold! crunchy and bland!
you've gained seven pounds!
homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
that's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
it's four o'clock on a saturday.
nothing!
bart, i have a plan: we go to the morgue and come back with a hand. put its fingerprints all over the railing... why are you being so quiet, bart? are you judging me? please don't judge me. i can't live with the guilt. i'm going to martin's house... to end it all!
oh no you don't. let him have it, marge!
wait in line for a book? you tell 'em bart says "hey".
okay, i'm gonna hand out colored bracelets. the color on your bracelet will determine--
tv! tv! tv!
i think you've got a point! homie, i'm gonna be a dancer!
you have a drinking problem?
gay out?
dad... marinating with you is cool.
you have wasted my time! you have made a very powerless enemy. good day and be well!
you can skip the "k" and the "y" -- i do not thank you and i will not come again.
well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints...
as the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. i spent the whole morning blackin' out the "goshes" and "darns" in these hardy boys books.
dad, you never win a fight with animals. remember when you lost that war with the worms?
dad! dad, a little help?
what am i doing? i don't need secondhand smoke to do ballet. i need firsthand smoke!
a sturgeon is a fish.
there's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. look at me, i'm glowing!
homie, lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy.
that's easy for you to say. you've never had to be thin and focused.
i'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital.
who was that?
five minutes, ladies.
what if someone catches him?
does that mean i can stop training to be a mexican wrestler?
you can just drop me off here.
order! order!
oh, right. dad was colonel homer and he wore that awesome suit and lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! but i forget how mom felt about it...
ms. lumpkin owed fifty thousand dollars in back taxes. with penalties, interest and the celebrity resentment tax, that sum has grown to twelve million dollars. however, she's been missing for several years, since her career went into a downward spiral.
listen, i'm sorry i called you all those mean things like, oh, i don't even remember...
sadly, no. most of my money went to my ex-husbands.
so that's it. she's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
i made that hug happen!
yeah, all i see is a gut with knees!
fine with me. look, i packed you a bag.
no problem. i bought you a hat.
and here comes grampa with an otter!
uh, yeah...
colonel, you're still my knight in white polyester.
babe, i need a hundred bucks for beer.
so dean martin would show up at the last minute and do everything in just one take?
hey, check it out! i wouldn't mind driving that over a prairie dog village! honk to the driver! martin?! what's a tool like you doing on something cool like that?
can i join, dad? can i? can i? can i?
not this one.
oh man.
ow! what was that for?
you are now entering the killing floor.
why do we have to get here so early? the football game doesn't start for hours.
it's just forks and plates. didn't we bring any food?
no, us!
no dad, i want you to play homer simpson.
okay everyone -- just be yourself. don't look in the camera, pretend i'm not here, and... no toupees...
and... let's roll.
i can't believe i'm a director with a movie at sundance.
i try to answer that question in my films.
i can eat a raw onion without crying.
yeah, but i'm crying about something else.
i'm lisa simpson. and this is my family.
they're like the family from hell on acid that's on steroids!
oh, i was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life.
"lisa simpson's unflinching, darkly comic family portrait is the can't-miss hit of the festival. landspeeder, do not bantha, to your nearest cinema to see lisa simpson stab her family in the back with her camera."
let me get a picture of you strangling my kid!
hey, we pay your salary.
thank god they're not jeering at us anymore.
lead-based toys! lead-based toys!
homer is a lard butt.
homer has booger breath.
homer is a big jerk.
dung muncher. / stink brains. / cheese wang. / captain crud.
uh, mom? we've got a code four.
the door's open! i think someone broke in!
i hear noises coming from the kitchen!
who cares? if you kill him, we'll be on tv!
homie, what's going on?
homer, i'm sorry i had to pretend to be dead. but it worked, because the government isn't looking for me anymore. i can finally stop running and be your mom.
what do you mean?
homer, i'm through protesting and chaining myself to things. i've realized that the most important thing in my life is you.
anyway, the right guard keeping cool under pressure award goes to--
homer, are you okay?
sweetheart, when i left you, it was because i thought i could make the world a little bit better. maybe all i did was make my own world a lot worse. i only hope you can forgive me.
i understand -- these things take time. goodnight.
come on, homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever.
okay, comforting, comforting... uh dad, whenever i would hang out with grandma, she would always ask me about you. and i'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad.
that bad.
sorry about your ma, homer.
look homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our lord, who came back as bread. that's it.
homer, look what i found with your mother's things.
and lastly, for homer, i leave you something very special.
go to springfield monument park and climb to the highest point. at exactly three o'clock, release my ashes. i love you, homer. and now, because they're your favorite, please enjoy some animal bloopers.
hey, homer! your butt still looks big from down here!
you know, spiritually speaking, grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... so, in a way... uh... i'm lying down now.
excuse me, i think i'm holding up better than you are. in fact, i've got energy to spare.
guidance system destroyed. launch aborted.
are you hurt?
here's your mother.
hey, i've seen your wife. she's no mamie van doren.
i suppose there's no harm in telling you. i'm using the rocket to dispose of springfield's nuclear waste -- by sending it straight to the heart of the amazon rainforest!
excellent.
homer! hey, homer! here's gramma's knife!
that's already a thing -- thimbles, right?
fine.
but she'll live on forever in what you did today.
thank you! thank you! wow, four thousand episodes -- seems like just yesterday krusty stole his first joke from me. seriously, though, i remember watching him as a kid, and i thought "i could do that -- and i'm a kid!" what i love about krusty is, he's always on... but to find out what, you've gotta test his pee!
krusty klovnen baby visker?
it's clown trouble. that's your responsibility.
wait, wait, wait! i'll start you off with this bicentennial quarter...and i'll throw in my man scrunchie.
all right, time to fill these slots with coins. specific coins? this hobby sucks!
wow, i never thought of it like that.
you bet i do.
"...was mistakenly minted in december of 1917, when a brief glimpse of a woman's ankle caused three days of rioting at the philadelphia mint."
one of these has got to be that smooching lincoln penny. nope... nope... dime... button... pepperoni slice...
nope... nope... nope...
our last item up for bid is a mint-condition 1917 "kissing lincoln" penny.
dad?
ten million.
mmm... i paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it.
yes, but the problem is, if you had it, i wouldn't. you see the difficulty...
i already don't! homer, i've got great news!
granted! homer simpson?! you are a repeat offender.
bail is set at twenty-five thousand dollars.
we'll put up your bail money. just pay us ten per cent and show up for your court date.
so wait -- are we telling people now?
bullet-proof glass.
maybe you're right. maybe i should...
homer, you could've killed him!
what the?
well... i could use money. but you have to promise me something, homer.
we have to do everything by the book.
dear lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. and also, thank you for my partner homer, who... did you just taser my coffee?
our first bail jumper!
homer, take the taser out of your pants.
whoa! there's still bullets in some of these!
what'd you get for me?
this is evidence.
oh, homie. i got you something too. a sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
how dare you?!
sorry, sorry muscle spasm.
i like their christian cover band: a.d.-b.c.! kindly deeds / done for free / kindly deeds
hm. i've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
man, that's harder to swallow than evolution.
not bad.
homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! you need a special sticker just to bring a bike! have you no respect for the law?
homer, no! you promised... everything was supposed to be by the book!
this partnership is over!
you know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas.
i hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
homie, what do you say we go to bed? you, me and the cake?
you jumped bail, homer. i gotta bring you in.
i figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at lisa's recital.
for the last few weeks. but most of the time i've known you you've treated me like dirt!
i forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
i like you too, but you broke the law. so i've got to bring you in.
thanks, but... what are you holding on to?
don't feel too bad, homie. you'll be free tomorrow. and i used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me.
bonehead.
lady, you are the best mom ever!
okay, bart went to the comic book store. bullies!
dad, do laundry.
look at bart go! he must be running away!
oh my god, he's out of frame! zoom out! zoom out! he's circling the shelbyville bird sanctuary.
pull over -- bart's in this field!
bart! where are you, bart?
so i can't always be there for bart. he's got to learn to take care of himself.
where's maggie?
look at me! i'm doin' something!
that is true. another ironic "tale of the kwik-e-mart".
i thought it was fifty.
hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger.
now homer, boys will be boys.
dang that bart! thanks to him, i have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat.
why can't our son just behave?
they're not boogers! they're clumps of rubber cement. that i stored in my nose.
thank you for being a friend...
maybe i'm just not hungry.
father, could you--
please stop spitting food on me!
keep your food in your mouth, you semi-literate spew-monkey!
homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!
so now bart is on his way to aspen, where they're going to try to kill him!
there's bart!
are you guests at the lodge?
i can't listen to this anymore.
aw... young love.
i don't know...
and in that mud, i'm plantin' the seed of friendship. name's ned flanders! as the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!
really? not married? and you were bicycling two abreast?
since two this afternoon. welcome to our honeymoon!
homer simpson, i would be delighted not to marry you.
i'm cuckoo for killing stuff!
your neck looks like a sideways ass!
that's the fuel gauge.
you haven't said you're sorry.
of course -- it's just past the sushi bar, behind the limbo pit, right in front of the blackjack table. and feel free to stay. we just put out the cheese -- we have cubes of yellow, cubes of orange, and cubes of orange and yellow.
oh, for me?
you're a funny one. that's strong -- are you trying to get me drunk?
you know, my horoscope said i'd meet the man of my dreams tonight.
you are adorable! are you... alone?
why are you dancing with that strange woman?
how about a sushi fight?
thanks for the lift.
a log cabin? what am i, davy crockett? also, who's davy crockett?
i'll take ten bucks no-ow.
well, when the sun goes down it means god's gone to china to watch over those good folks. time for some shuteye.
sorry, homer, i'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds.
that's just your trouser devil talking!
you don't need her, baby. sylvia's got everything you want.
pineapple and pepperoni.
eh-eh-eh! first we make love, then we decide if it was a good idea. that's the european way.
homer, i can be whoever you want me to be.
uh... the same thing you're doing here.
we sure did. rekindle, rekindle... okay, let's go.
fine. but i don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.
okay, but first the chest.
homie?
and we'll stay up forever!
homer simpson, you devil!
homer simpson, you devil! but i think we should unpack first...
okay.
so... i'm sure you missed marge last night.
what a charming single entendre. now look, i know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever.
okay, here she comes! why don't you take marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?
what are you doing?
take my hand!
homer, our marriage isn't on a piece of bark! it's in us! now take my hand! /
me neither, homie.
knock it off back there.
okay, but keep it pg.
pg-13.
make that sixteen. lousy dog. if you had your way, i'd walk you every day.
splendid! shall we discuss music, or the weather?
she wants to break up?
with me?
gee. compared to you, my life is one big half-day!
what? i just talked to him.
homer? it's your old roommate, grady.
grady is breaking up with me?!
in his what? awww. oh, baby, you are the breakup king. you have made the seven minutes that i'm gonna go without love so much more bearable.
homie?
cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
no, none.
it's kind of a secret, so shut the door most of the way. we found a way to make this tournament interesting. we bet on the matches.
he has a name, you know!
i win!
dad, i could actually win this thing!
my only fear is, i always sabotage myself when i'm on the verge of happiness.
wish me luck.
i'll take your money. but i won't look you in the eye.
here's your money. drenched in your daughter's tears.
and there's something different about him. he bought new shoelaces. with fancy metal tips! dad? did you come into some money we don't know about?
and your car antenna has been straightened and re-balled. what's goin' on?
no, i'm not mad.
hey, mr. s... lisa b...
would you like to buy some band candy?
a couple hours? i can do the sunday puzzle in less than one hour! a couple of hours... "last clue: "loses on purpose". hmmm... "diets!" oh, will shortz, you clever rascal. and a new record time! wait a second... "dumb dad sorry for his bet." wow, it's almost as if dad planted that message. no, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? oh, it must be...or mustn't it not? dad, i know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the new york times crossword puzzle?
take a look at the first letters of all the clues.
um... i'm also returning this kitten calendar.
i see you're admiring our mycube. it's fueled by dreams and powered by imagination.
sir, it's not even turned on yet.
what have you done with the old ones?
salaam alaikum!
bart forgot this, sir.
why don'tcha ask homer? he oughtta know, by dint of his son's new friend. 
homer, this is serious. this bashir kid is muslim, and therefore up to something.
under your statue of liberty's dress! and she loved it!
homie, it's very open-minded of you to have bart's muslim friend's muslim family over.
now bait the trap.
no, thank you.
i like the way you italians think.
i think it is time for us to go.
well, i want you to go over to their house and apologize!
homer, i'm sure you didn't see anything. go to sleep.
you rubbed? you must like me. you really, really like me! good morrrning, ramadan! come to crazy fayeddie's! our prices are hussein! heeeeere's genie!
no, now i will destroy your decadent western society.
oh, it's you. what do you want?
mr. simpson, i accept your apology. goodbye.
yes.
that's allah!
no, i...
dad, it was an empty building. it was supposed to come down!
that was supposed to open tomorrow.
the duff brewery is on that island.
seven...
three...
and...
dad, we have to do something -- all the bees are dying! but dad, bees pollinate flowers.
bees.
i'm glad you called me. i know i'm not the first scientist in the phone book. that's associate professor aaron ableman, how i hate him. thundering thorax, it's just exactly what i feared! ...in there. close. see these red dots? this bee has been felled by bee measles -- or as i call it, "beasles."
i'm going to talk to the girl from now on.
uh-huh...
um mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes.
dad, don't eat the bees!
listen lisa, i was trying to think of a way to help your bees and i remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town.
silence! now, let's make some noise for everyone's favorite basketball team, whom i have renamed the springfield excitement.
really? listen homer, in the back room i got these super-tough africanized bees. i saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited african honeys, and that's what they sent me. if we could combine them with lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment.
actually homer...
no, the bees!
got the queen?
they sound awfully mad. are they dangerous?
why do we have to go to the rec center? i wanna play with my friends!
you're older. why don't you do these fun activities?
we could be murderers.
great! here are a few "best friend" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--
i just said that.
now remember, juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior.
nice doorbell. is it computerized?
homer, isn't it wonderful that my juliet and your lisa have become such fast friends?
dinner's ready!
i'll go get her!
i'm not that kind of doctor!
mr. and mrs. simpson, we need to talk about lisa. she's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own.
we're talking about lisa, your daughter.
ah yes, the one i've seen on lisa's facebook page. i search all the children's facebook pages for unflattering references to me. by the way, i enjoyed the photos of your trip to yosemite.
i wonder if lisa has threatened the model u.n. with her rice tariff yet.
no!
you probably would.
you got a letter all the way from new york city, and that's something!
homer, that guy's your age?
what about sunday?
your father's just jealous because vance was our class president in high school.
dad, you ran for class president?
there they are, my favorite mixed-race couple!
he's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
clear a path, boys.
hey, homer simpson! how you been?
behind this smile is a bigger smile trying to get out. oh. oh here it comes! oh yeah!
hey, homer, you wanna try my new vance connor-politan? like vance, it is smooth, cool and oh-so-sophisticated.
yeah, me too.
just let it go, homer.
finally, you returned my shovel.
there it is!
no, this is the box that tells us where the ballot box is. right under this.
homer simpson...
homer simpson...
please stop doing that.
both. homer simpson... vance connor... fonzie... homer simpson... and the winner is homer simpson!
hey!
dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better.
uh-oh. looks like one of my former students on a quest for truth.
i can explain. but... are you sure we should talk in front of your son?
i already knew that, dad. i'm gonna blame you.
with a virgin tom collins for me?
oh, you could know. if you dared.
you see too much. now, watch the sauce of bubbling red and see the life you could have led.
ho-mer! ho-mer! ho-mer!
ask-a the garlic bread.
homer, do you have a date for the prom yet? sorry, the only girl i could ever want is right over there...
thank you, homer.
nobody's ever asked me to use my head-brain before!
oh my god. he's talking to me.
who wants a cheerleader on the rebound?
i can hardly believe this is real.
i don't know, but in this reality, i am not gay! hubba hubba!
young man, you have the noble bearing of the barbarian leader vercingetorix .
well, that's what's missing. our lives would be horrible without the kids.
homie, please come inside.
dad, we need to have a talk.
dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong.
yep. in the future, people will look at this and they'll say "whoever he was, he must've mattered."
pardon me... can my son have his picture taken with you?
well, we can't all be homer simpson, son.
plaques come, plaques go.
i hear there's a korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.
it's the first day of school!
i can't believe we have to start another year of school. i never learned anything at that suck shack.
kid at school.
woo-hoo! test day at last! now i can show off at a federal level. hey bart, on the practice test yesterday, what did you pick as the best title for the paragraph about "manifest destiny?" dad, bart's throwing away his future!
i.d., please.
homie! what are you doing home so early?
you mean back to the poor house?
we can discuss it later. right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club.
oh my god! oh my god! we're totally liable!
van johnson was never half the man van heflin was. oops.
apaches!
there's twelve more boxes. and they all sound the same!
what about my birthday party?
hey homer, i have some distant relatives that i never see except for this party. can i bring 'em to the party?
can't talk now, dear. it's four in the morning here in zurich. oh, right. we came together.
homer, i always wonder, how can you afford this party year after year?
huh. i'm not sure that's how it works.
but, but, but...
homie, do you know anything about this?
oh, wait. i left out a zero.
don't be sore at the banks. hell, we fired our c.e.o., and he barely got out with fifty million dollars!
i know, i know. but bernice wants you out.
did you remember to disconnect it first?
i need a place to store my cufflinks.
well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, i appreciate the sediment.
come on, kids! let's take our stuff back inside.
for he's a fabulous flanders, which nobody can deny!
well, let's see what else is in the job jar.
he won't come over!
the rent check is late.
people like flanders make me sick. if i was marge's landlord i'd fix her pipes and i'd shower her with flowers and-and take her on a romantic getaway to the south seas and i... i'd never return.
hey, dad.
you want a cookie, dad?
i died when homer sat on me!
homer simpson, i took pity on you, and what do i get in return? a kick in the kadiddlehopper!
when the month is up, i want you out!
your leaving is our christmas!
wha? who's that?
uh, say, "jesus," what was the name of the son of zachariah?
homie, i think it's an eviction notice. we're gonna be homeless, like lucille ball in "the stone pillow"!
wheee! i'm gonna live like a human in a real house! what's the catch?
for what?
right, 'cause i wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes billie jean king, susan sontag, sappho of lesbos, and, i suspect, peppermint patty...
flanders feeds me people food!
oh my god. we're out on the street!
but kicking is the only toy i have.
well, hasn't this been a peach of a breach! we'll see you in court.
i'm gonna see it first!
hit the road, ya big load!
we have totality, people! 
for years... for years...
you guys have treated me like a princess. every day's been like the first ten minutes of mother's day!
dad! come in the kitchen! quick!
wha--
look at that -- one of god's discarded miracles.
no. the poor dear is right where she belongs. god help you, sir!
wait, i have an idea! one of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent.
homie, i haven't held maggie all day. can you hand her to me?
ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! who's a chubby baby? but that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner. hm. you're not usually this greedy.
you told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!
i'm sorry for fibbing. tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home.
well that sucked! / there's a day we'll never get back! / i was so bored.
what is that soothing sound?
oh, you mean the "yousoup 5000."
if i'm more relaxed i'll be a better mom! can we? can we? wait a minute, who am i pleading with?
maybe we should get out now.
hey, cool your jets! we're trying to get to sleep!
the thing is, i ain't got much life left to live. and a wasted day like today is one i know i'll never get back.
well, there are a few things i was hopin' to do before i become dust in a jar.
anyway, i made a list.
that's right. now let's make our reservations.
d'ye mean it? look, don't toy with an old man's heart, now.
this is the life in ire-land...
i just had a nightmare... that i was back with your mother! 
so long, suckers!
i'm in a.a.
i'm late for a teleconference with hong kong, ya fat gob!
sorry, but smokin' in pubs ain't part of the new ireland. also, you can't text while driving.
bite your tongue! that will never, ever happen!
what has happened to the ways of old?
homer and his da!
so, it's escapin' you're thinkin' of, then?
son, this was all my fault. you were just trying to make an old man happy.
the parson?! he's coming here?
well, i'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when i wasn't actually a minister. uh, since that time, you two have not been legally wed.
who are you calling an old lady?
yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock.
hello?
homer, what's going on? the violin, pants with a crease, why?
oh yes, homer! yes!
well, the last time i checked, pirates weren't gay.
no rockets! you can pick the frosting.
all right, people, i want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation.
there is no "we" in wedding!
i can't believe you told lenny and carl they could bring dates! 'cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
you're going to be here a while.
as of now, your pathetic little life means nothing.
to remove that chain, you need the key to the lock.
the lollipop is made of hot sauce.
wow, you're the smartest guy in that room.
he's right here.
i'm just happy you're back. now let's get that chain off you.
and with the inking and application of this stamp, you are officially married. next!
oh, ya hate to see this.
as we enter the seventh amazing overtime, the members of sesame street on ice wait impatiently to begin their matinee performance. hold the black label, mabel! the utica mohawks' pete mavroudis has broken through the 'topes' defense!
you're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
so that will do it from wayne bockhorn, jean-pierre pétomane, and me, doc jacques lalonde, here at utica's kill-kwik rat poison arena.
you want to know the score? i'll tell you the score.
here's the score, mister:
your daughter barely knows who you are!
maggie.
i'm spiffin' up the place! jeez, can't a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin' polite inquiries? huh. i got a window here.
ooh, hey maggie! maggie, maggie, maggie!
'cause he can't remember limericks?
it's a-a-b-b-a, dumbass!
you've been spending so much time with her.
here she is, uh, homer. the wonderful girl i been tellin' you about.
well... if i remember my high school physics, the controlled nuclear reaction creates steam which powers a turbine...
all right, homer. let's see what my baby's been up to.
homer simpson, you are a strong finisher.
what's the matter, homer?
yeah, i wish i could say the same.
uh... i... i spend a lot of time working with this mentally-challenged guy. why, here he is now. lookin' good, homer!
we believe lisa is suffering from environment related despair.
lisa is a little young to be taking "happy pills."
no angle. um, if this girl i'm seeing comes here, and she might, i wouldn't mind if you told her i was the kind of boy that does the dishes.
i can't believe she dumped me!
it's like a sauna in here! it is a sauna in here. must've been put in by a previous owner. this house is full of surprises. but this is the first good one. i can't wait to tell everyone!
dad, yes!
no it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!
yeah, sure. it's complimentary.
oh, i thought that was a y, for "yanky." i'll make a note in your chart that you aren't always clear.
homer, you have become a super-taster. the mildest spices will overwhelm your tongue. even a taco could drive you insane.
cinco.
try these beets. i boiled all the red out.
it's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. the blandest food known to man.
pecan blandies... cream of steam... you guess 'ems...
lunch card... lunch card... lunch card?
dad, what are you doing here?
three dollars and eighty-five cents.
i'll start you on jell-o.
i used to date your daughter.
dad, do you have to hang out at my school? it's bad enough i have to be here three days a week!
that's why i'm here -- to make sure he gets good grades.
well, call me over-involved, but some day your son will be my son's chauffeur.
it's not your son's fault, it's yours. you have to hover over your kid's shoulder to force him to succeed. it's called "helicopter parenting."
well, i...
am i?
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
don't forget, children -- monday is the balsa-wood model-building competition. the american balsa council will award this year's winner a thousand-dollar savings bond for their college education.
my mistake.
hmm, well, they are good ones.
well that's very nice of you-- hey! you sayin' my clothes are clown-like? oh god, i feel so insecure! please be my friend...
i do! / yeah! / you know it! / oh boy!
no, oh sure, no, uh no... that's all right. if i didn't sell booze, they probably wouldn't even come here.
we'd like some balsa wood, please.
what scale are you using?
washington monument? aren't you gonna even try?
i'm your son's principal, and the washington monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. it's like saying "i don't care. my kid's a loser."
you won't get past the north transept!
blabby's gonna build an abbey. groovy.
isn't this supposed to be my project?
do you want me to watch and learn?
that's terrible advice.
oh, and where is this delightful boy?
homer, there are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.
experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes.
flawless... stunning... awe-inspiring... meticulous... skin-ner! these models are clearly the work of meddling parents! the only entry that repels my eye enough to be constructed by a student is this one! congratulations, son. at least you followed the rules.
why can't you guys let us do things for ourselves. in the words of oscar wilde: "experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes." i saw him too, dad.
i'm sorry, dad. these girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. i hope you understand.
no, there's a middle ground.
what's wrong, homie?
well, i know a place in this house where you can really relax.
no, i gave that to the homeless shelter.
feeling better, super dad?
wait, wait, wait. you're putting us in a new school?! what about my friends?
ah, so cheap, eh?
no windows, no parking, and a man died here.
right here.
it's just a formality to make sure you actually live here. some people use the address just so their kids can go to our schools.
call it, friendo.
well done. now, let me validate your parking.
it's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.
please just stay there till bart graduates high school.
brought you a housewarming present.
hey, are you into poker?
this man-crush just got bro-mantic!
does she have a sister?
we don't need a bed. we're not gonna be sleeping.
you know what a girl likes, mister. so, can i see you again?
i love tapas! it's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
surprise! i redecorated!
you don't need a wii now that i'm here. because you and me make "us."
where have you been? we have mirrors to hang!
without me? how'd you get there?
"go dog go" with pages missing... lego spaceship poorly assembled... clearly, this is the home of elementary school children. too bad. i was looking forward to killing you and making it look like a suicide.
i am not your friendo.
your comments when we watch movies aren't funny.
please, i just want to go back to a place where i'm ostracized for being me, not for who i pretend to be.
but...
deal.
i wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
i thought i was marrying a man who could play macbeth.
wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting "i dare not" wait upon "i would?"
snore. snore.
that "crazy talk" is the work of the immortal bard, william shakespeare.
you don't even know your lines!
tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... dr. hibbert as banquo?!
he's the one getting the good reviews! which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
macbeth!
all i heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. unless you're not man enough.
that's where you're wrong! get out on that stage!
okay homer, it's our last performance, you're the only actor that's still alive, and there's nobody in the audience -- this is your moment. i'll be in my office going over the books on my subway sandwich franchise. you call a sandwich maker an artist, it's like an invitation to steal! a guy's goin' nani-nooni bananas in there!
now nothing will stop you from taking on all of shakespeare's greatest roles: king lear... hamlet... othello... richard the third... henry the fourth, part one... henry the fourth, part two... henry the fifth... titus andronicus...
you... are... acceptable!
well, i qualified for the national math bee--
guess who the garden club elected president?
no. i lost.
homer, we have a problem.
we need you to slim down, muscle up and become the "everyman" people want to be instead of the one they actually are.
maybe...i can help lyle mccarthy.
here's what brad and angelina looked like before they met me.
something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth.
i'm gonna teach you healthy emotional alternatives to eating. we don't have much time, so we'll do it in a montage to the song "eye of the tiger."
yeah, it's your montage.
no.
i gotta take this. tobey! cider house rules! total wuss. seabiscuit, you keepin' off the sugar cubes? i hate this guy. i love this guy! tobe, tobe, tobe, we talked about this -- if the rice ain't brown, don't chow down! look, i gotta bail, i'm with everyman right now. no, no, no, no, no don't worry, he totally sucks! i'm only lying to him. goodbye! bad-bye.
hey, home town buffet, like i told john travolta, my client list is private. you know what, enough chitchat. hit the pole! stripper up! fireman down! and sexy! heroic! sexy! heroic! and sexy! heroic! earn that money!
and cut!
oh, homie... take your shirt off again. there's less of you to love, but i love you even more. what was that?!
i'm being paid to do what i love!
homer? homer sapian! can i have a word with you? i know this is a bad time, but i'm leaving for another gig.
don't take it personally, home-team. just remember what i taught you.
i have taught you well. goodbye!
come and get me. 
i think you may have put on a little weight.
well, i don't know. i might have some milk that has expired. ah, here we are... a delightful buttermilk from nineteen sixty-one. oh, sixty-one. everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer. whatever you do, do not chew the chunks.
everyman! show yourssself!
okay. it was turtle from "entourage."
come on, home run. it's okay, home alone. look, i'm sorry. let me make this up to you. i'll train you. then leave you again. then come back and train you. it's how i make my money.
you, me and turtle.
he is a great guy. he's an awful guy.
mr. simpson, i don't need your money. bart can definitely be a challenge, but i like challenges. and he... he's got a wild sense of humor. look at this picture he drew: 
what?
yes. just one: relax. you're clearly a caring father.
dad... am i bad on the inside?
no, i mean teacher.
what discussion?
thanks for bringing me here, dad. i'll remember this day on my deathbed.
whoa. maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?
sure, no problem. twenty-five dollars, please.
kill! kill! kill! kill!
mom, don't do this! this sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you! tell her, dad! you love ultimate punching even more than i do!
glad you didn't come cheap.
one, two / we say boo! / three, four / stop the gore!
mom, you can't fight that guy.
thank you, homie.
someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. this goes against every feminist bone in my body, but dad, can't you control your woman?
oh marge, if only i knew what these paintings meant. i know the woman i loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense.
what? you think just 'cause i'm black i know all other black people?
there must be a better way.
yeah, but last year i took barney dressed as marge. think how much better they'll think you look.
that's. my. son. 
two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.
no. let's go home. we can enjoy some mixed "marital" arts.
the munchers got moe!
please let me in!
i'm your father and i need your help!
dad, no! that's the last book in the world!
if so, secrets locked within his blood could be the key to saving humanity. you must get him immediately to the safe zone, just outside of town. and if you see my wife... tell her i love her.
we don't have a panic room!
come with me if you want to live.
psst! this way!
dad, are you becoming a muncher?
where do you want it, the mouth or the eyes?
how 'bout some of my new microbrew? must be another mouse in the pipe. let's see if this cobra solves it. nothin'. just once i wish cupid / would draw back his bow / and shoot me a cutie / whose standards are low...
he what?!
read on. it gets gayer.
i/you could do...
homer?! does this mean you still love me?
i always have.
ah, i expect you're all anxiously awaiting my choice for your new supervisor.
hmm...
the nitwits are runnin' the goofhouse!
after work. and the first beer's on me.
he had to have part of his tongue removed. that's real funny.
great safety report, homer -- no meltdowns all week. i'm making you my new executive assistant.
and call.
homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages.
tomorrow, my love.
book me a massage.
homie?
garden view?
why don't you just roll me?
dammit, why won't you touch me?
last night was the making it up to me! the most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
i can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.
thank you, um...
when we get back to the hotel, i want you to extend our stay... indefinitely.
homer, there is a moth in my room! where are you!?
what?! homer! return to the immortal city of light at once! or you're fired!
boy, that was worth the wait.
dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on sunday?
smack it! whack it! thwack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! bop it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! bop it!
bonk-bonk-bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! bop it! twist it! smack it! thwack it bonk it! bop it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it!
oh don't worry, we don't kill it. we just dip it.
what happened is, i saved your life. now you's had a rough day. why'n'tcha have a pull on this?
this here's my pride and joy: 'ol betsy.
what's your take, city boy?
text your mom to pick us up.
you said you were at a parenting class!
you heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. to ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. the moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it. that river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
well, i think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in lisa's life is which boy will marry her. right, homer? homer?
in outstanding lighting direction electronic multi-camera for variety, music or comedy programming, we have... a three-way tie!
global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.
dad... i want a baby brother.
lisa got a sister! why can't you have another boy?
bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.
oh what a lovely evening.
maybe we could do both.
homer simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our dvd player.
okay!
uh-huh, and now hand me your neck...
mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
a few more minor adjustments, aaand... 
so many sisters... save me, bart!
sounded like i said naked bacon.
see. we all thought it was naked--
but if you--
in one minute, we'll be starting our rock-quatic roll-tacular!
you know, i did sit on a shark once...
let's give a wet and wacky welcome to springfield's oldest performing mollusk...
slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
well, sir, it looks like your dad is a quotable notable.
...clark gable owes me a book. and he never paid me for the shoeshine. but his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. lunch butter we called it.
he does all the time. you just never listen.
ooh, i like this kid.
i don't think that's true.
you only care about me now because i'm famous!
ring? what ring?
and if this is homer, you're too late for my love!
... and that's how you win an opium war!
the yangtze river swallows all secrets.
yes, although these days i can make neither haste nor waste. you know, simpson -- this has truly been a lovely afternoon. release... a hound.
here comes the prize / pulitzer prize / i'll finally be successful / in my mother's eyes
i sure did. but why don't we let homer tell the story.
i think you're ready for your first ramble.
i'm hangin' on every word.
i don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.
i'm afraid your daily donuts are no more.
no!
easy there, habitrail.
i'm a corporate recruiter who specializes in nuclear workers.
the krusty show sucks now. it's all pink and princessy. why are great things always ruined by women? the army... the fantastic four... think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy!
you got it, gator.
oh, i imagine cap city's been wooing you with trips to the seashore, a christmas goose, spanish lemons... folderol i can't afford to match. but please, accept this little going away present.
oh, but these aren't just any donuts. these donuts were made the old-fashioned way: the dough is sweetened with cuban sugar from pre-batista plantations, then it's deep fried in the tallow of three different animals, two of which are now extinct.
you like tomato...
potato!
tomato!
let's call the whole thing off...icially onnnnn! and toast... valerie and daaaaave!
homie, i'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people...
homer's got a girlfriend!
mine says "something you lost will soon turn up." my faith in the lord -- it came back!
if it's your lucky day, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.
sí, sí...
homer! where are you?
/ / /
good evening, mr. homer, how can i--
seven-oh-seven? that's exactly the moment i was furious at you for missing our toast. and now i'm the one who has to ask... can you forgive me?
wait a minute, homer! you can't spend any of that money or marge will know you lied.
the laundry. the machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it.
why don't you just buy things your family needs, and leave them where they'll find them?
you threw it, you go find it.
ow! there's a big box in here!
that's just what we need! but how are we going to get it home?
what are you doing?
okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?
look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. you work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot.
don't forget my cut.
so... where you from, homer?
yeah. come on up. you can play the tambourine.
here we go, folks -- the ultimate zero-gravity experience!
no way! i wanna go a million more times!
rich kids don't need school! when i grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super.
oh great, now that dad's gonna star in it.
mo-om...
homeroom, eight a.m.
mo-om...
hey, hey, hey. let's not get crazy. if you quit, i'm telling mom everything.
okay, but just 'cause i'm your best friend, don't be afraid to use that whip.
well, i kind of got a clue when i heard that "ballooning safety" video.
you were what?!
so we're right back where we used to be.
oh my god!
you like potato...
you like tomato...
gentlemen, i'm afraid we've detected a small leak somewhere in the heavy water piping facility. don't leave until you find that leak!
you're one smart cookie, rosemary. that left boob was too good for him. we're appalling!
really? how romantic?
it's so noisy in here! i can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
it's not the same.
ooh, ice skating. a sport that encourages hand-holding.
sorry, no skating tonight.
actually... ...it's called "curling." players slide the heavy stones toward the circle, or "house..." ...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.
yeah, like the time you said dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?
hey, look who "slid" into our "house."
astonishing news out of eau claire, wisconsin: the olympic committee has announced that mixed curling will be a demonstration event at the winter olympics!
homer, while you were imagining what the winter olympics were, seymour said we were all going to the olympic trials!
homer, who's that?
pay your bill!
hoo-hoo!
well, homer's my soul mate! and you don't dump a soul mate!
team u.s.a. heads to the gold medal match! but wait a minute! marge simpson looks hurt! this is the sort of bittersweet melodrama olympic coverage feeds on! i admit it! we're vampires who suck on shattered dreams!
i'm not horny, i'm mad.
no surrender! let's give the olympics a miracle!
the u.s.a. has won demonstration gold. our first and only medals of these entire olympics. kids, open your history books, tear out the pages and put this indelible olympic moment in!
not a one! maybe the nicest was abigail simpson, who you know as the pittsburgh poisoner...
this entry's dated april 14th, 1860.
i can't believe we're descended from slave owners!
then they should've called it the "above-ground normal-road."
what are you doing? i wanna know what happens next.
but-but-but-but-but...
ooh, good idea. bart, what are you doing for black history month?
to the reference desk!
i'll take that secret to my grave! or urn, or medical school dissecting table, or wherever you're dumpin' me!
okay, i'll talk! d-day is june 6th! repeat: june 6th! allied forces will land on the beaches of normandy in the following order: utah, omaha, gold, juno... are you writing this down, fritz?
that's why my jazz is so smooth!
i don't know what the big deal is. i mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's french. you know, bouvier?
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out. does that help?
one month? that's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
thanks for doing the dishes.
y'know -- i think bart might have too much homework. if they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever.
dear lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that i am right as usual.
there's no such thing as prayer blocks!
the violence really relaxes me.
don't contradict me in front of our son!
smooth move, mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer.
the last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!
you practiced all day on my birthday!
i don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!
well then there won't be any sex!
i'm sorry we ever fought.
till the two of us are back on track, bart can fend for himself.
what do you mean?
really? okay.
oh my god, homie -- we're having a real conversation!
you won't believe how i got home.
thanks, dad. but you're so loud it's hurting my ears.
"mom and dad, bart is going to use the old subway to destroy springfield elementary!" and there's a map of the subway system attached. homer, we've got to stop him!
we're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.
mister, you are grounded!
turn right in... fifty meters.
dad, no! that takes us into a construction site!
turn right in two-point three kilometers...
dad, i know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school i kind of like. anyway, i'm really hoping you could... dad?
on the top of the slide.
mr. simpson, i'm an attorney, and my husband is a federal prosecutor, and neither of us is happy.
and we will make you regret the day your son was born.
if i talk to nikki, i'm sure i can--
this is awesome! if only real life was in 3-d.
i'm bart simpson. disruptive fourth-grader.
that's not bart, it's principal skinner. bart's sitting right next to you.
shut up, fatso.
...man i ever met!
i sense a "but" coming, reverend...
homer? homer? y'know, our bible study group is going to the holy land next month. i'd like you and your family to come as my guests.
homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!
the old city. where b.c. turned into a.d.! let's go!
homer, that's not why we're here. we can see the stations of the cross!
lord, please help homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land.
homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?
homer...
bleh.
yes, but it means more to you.
lord, i think i may have finally reached him... bleh! bleh! bleh! homer, quit playing that back.
reading prayers and ignoring them, just like god. hey, this one's from you. "dear lord, don't let marge find out the hotel leaves chocolates on the pillows at night."
and lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. and thank you, again, for the challenge of homer simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. me homer, you the cross. and now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of... 
homer, this is the most sacred spot in christendom, not your backyard hammock.
unknown? this is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
delete! delete! delete!
banned for life? homer, do you know why i'm a christian?
it's because i believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. at least i thought so till now. homer simpson, you are not worth saving.
you have been chosen, homer.
oh homie, you're alive!
but you still have our passports, right?
dad, are you okay?
uh... messiah... do you mind if i have a word with your wife?
what? israeli people are pushy? how about you experience a couple of genocides and see how laid-back you are? we were purged from spain. throw out of there. they allow everybody in spain, but for us, jews, no flamenco, get out. i'm pushy?! please. you stay there surrounded by your great enemy, canada. try syria for two months, then we'll see who's pushy.
i did it! i reached him!
in a soup you can boil it!
homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, i think you came closest to the truth.
you'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
...and so our employee of the month is the late roger ducette, who tragically died from complications due to union organizing. moving on. the power plant's first annual fourth of july picnic is this coming saturday!
burns -- what an ungrateful jerk! we hoofed our hearts out for him -- with no rehearsal!
that's a regular-sized bottle. i'm drinkin' jeroboams.
yeah, but don't some of that go to income tax?
no one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone! and just what might that be?
really? okay, eat your lunch.
you said it's your lunch. eat it.
they continued for some time in this vein, until...
i don't see any chewing!
well the catch is, happy workers are productive workers.
it was an accident! i didn't mean to kill our ants.
three cheers for mr. smithers! to mr. smithers! / hooray!
uh, excuse me. yes, the service on my car was excellent. five out of five. four out of five. five out of five. um, excuse me, can i go back and change that four out of five to five out of five? i'm wasting your time?
you told me you did.
you know, i used to wonder why mr. burns hated humanity. now i know. you open your heart and they mock your very decency!
it's official. smithers is now worse than mr. burns. instead of releasing hounds, he releases wolverines!
yeah. and they've replaced parking meters with this thing you stick your credit card into.
homer simpson, for causing a panic in the bank, you are hereby sentenced to one hundred hours of community service.
community service!
my wife only parms on my birthday. and that's only if i give her the sad puppy-dog look.
throw a jean jacket on top of these babies and you can go anywhere.
and everything in between. ever stop breathing when you're asleep?
overweight? you? oh now that's crazy. now me, i have to get my underwear specially made by this village in the ukraine. they call me "daddy round-round." send me a christmas card every year.
uh, earth to homer -- i arrested you there last month.
aw, now, who could blame you? your sports team lost. yeah. well i'll see you at moe's.
yeah, and you can feel good about eating here too, because all the cooks are ex-cons getting a second chance.
no you won't. follow me.
no, no, i got it.
g'ahead.
listen homer, uh... would you like to see my uh, my favorite place in the whole world?
homer, i'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. that's why our friendship is so special to me.
uh, me neither. but, but you know who does? ralphie. got a lot of worries, that kid: what if the bed wets him? what if superman decided to kill everybody?
homer... what happened to me?
you missed the wakeup. that's all that counts.
now? but i just woke up.
homer, where you been the last few weeks?
well, well, well. so this is the "saint elmo's fire" reunion that andrew mccarthy himself was going to attend.
yeah, yeah, yeah... whoa... what have we here? world's worst friend.
you mugs'll never take me alive, see.
i'm sorry, homer. if i hadn't been so needy, we wouldn't be in this trunk.
well, at least we got to be friends again -- y'know, before we got whacked.
you have that much faith in me?
well said, lou. oh homer, you want to take out the police copter and hassle people with the spotlight?
/ what's going on?
dad, while i agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle.
no... i am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy.
solar power is a bright idea!
goddag, friendlys! behold to you -- wind! the energy that powers denmark.
well, there are tax credits, government rebates... it will pay for itself in twelve to eighteen...
lifetimes.
lars, get the twine! you will not regret this!
it's making our meter run backwards!
dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company.
we will cancel your account, sir.
o'er the ramparts we what?!
my smoothie is a lumpy!
homer, this meeting of your "fan club" is adjourned!
kent's weather worriers are reporting gusts up to seventy-five...
homie, maybe this is too much electricity.
our wedding china's ruined.
hey, mom... dad... there's a whale on the beach... you've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!
homie, can i talk to you for a second?
but i don't know how to drive.
lisa is very sensitive. if something she loves dies in front of her--
it's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
operation desert ocean is a go! let's get this lady fish into the blue zone!
she doesn't like lying on the beach! she likes being in the ocean!
maybe i should just be alone a little bit.
they must be bluella's children! hello, whale calves! your mother lives on through you! huh? run! i mean, swim! i mean . those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. i guess it's just nature's way.
dad? where did you get that boat?
drop the 'poon!
linda, please.
dad, no! they're right. if the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, i can't let you do it.
dad! the sharks must think you're a baby whale!
it's the baby whales' dad!
do you think they'll be okay?
now, who wants...beer cozies! a shirt that says "yo!" sassy seat cushions! and flash drives for your p.c. so you can take your data and back it up!!!
no. i won't.
eh, just find the biggest idiot on our payroll and slip it in his bag. ooh. that's a bingo.
now the best mac and cheese i've ever had is at a bowling alley in ogdenville.
breadcrumbs on the top.
partly sunny!
a chance of severe thunder storms with golf ball-sized hail!
boy cheeks!... fanny!... derriere!... hiney!... backside!... ...cover up that coin slot!
experimenting with my butt.
homer, maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween. what's going on?
i don't see what's so wonderful.
but you promised!
this used to be just a little part of me.
i guess i did create this... like god created the devil.
i never wanted to turn into big brother. i just wanted to be little sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place.
one of our wives is leaving us for moe?!
you guys should go on that cruise. you'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father...
and i can spend my mother's day taking care of something i've been putting off for a long time.
that's something you've been putting off.
hey homer, what do you think mom meant by "taking care of something?"
dad! that's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
no battery?!
homer?
we're breaking up!
homer?
homer my mother's party's starting any minute. get busy.
sorry homer, i ain't servin' no liquor. just "o'glums" non-alcohol beer.
take our picture.
i wasn't smiling!
i had something in my teeth.
my eyes were shut.
oh, you'll find out. ...oh, man do i make the soup. my goodness do i make the soup.
if only that mark on your forehead was an off-button! hours later, she returned -- smelling of beer and pickled eggs. i know no more.
you do?! tell me!
then what happened?
well... i... uh...
i'm still mad at you from last night.
here it comes. the moment of truth.
so it is you, mr. homer. but let's be honest -- a woman of her age married to a man of-- how old are you? sixty-five?
it's that patty and selma. there's something evil about them. did you know they smoked when i was pregnant?
when i saw how much trouble your marriages were in... i knew i had to act fast. i got marge's mother to go to marge, convinced helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then i bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then i came over to fix things with manjula. and i wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. and even she left me. should not have used helium.
homie, slow down!
oh come on. what kind of big fat moron would fall for...
sorry, someone else has bought the house.
a lot of people sound like sideshow bob, like frasier on "cheers."
really? hm. maybe i... sideshow bob!
good. that'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
i'm not a writer.
yeah i've seen him. he... uh... said he was driving down to mexico.
now bob, you just take my face off nice and easy and kick it over here. there's a bee under my cheek! hey! hey no!
si?
homer, can we please find bart?
glad to say it, and now the girls will "yay" it!
hang on, here's a spot that still looks good. so, do we have a winner?
i think i've come up with the answer.
dad, do you realize we've put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined?
for what?
you're home early!
moe's is closed, huh?
i didn't see you come in.
you know what? i'll just cook this later. 
um, i'm gonna go read a book. 
that's nice. what kind of favor?
homie! i thought you were at that sports bar.
looks like jimmy's starting him off with a three-iron. now, my first shot was with a three-iron. one shot, and i was hooked for life. barely saw my family again. birthdays, anniversaries -- i missed 'em all. i'm missing my daughter's wedding right now. sweet guy, i'm told. one shot... hooked for life...
we're watching the nobel prize announcements, live from stockholm!
huzzah! i had him in the pool!
all right, all right, settle down. homer, you're the easiest laugh i know.
shut up. i'm gonna need you in the audience when i accept the peace prize in oslo.
they fight and bite / they fight! and bite and fight / fight! fight! fight! / bite! bite! bite! / the itchy and scratchy show!
how 'bout that airline food, huh?! they should've called it chicken cordon blecch!
we don't put "euro" in front of everything. euro-guards! take him away in euro-cuffs!
is it region one or region two?
region one.
first we're visiting grampa.
is that the cat in there?!
don't worry, homer -- i'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow.
wait a minute -- is that bag marc fredericks? you know, a much nicer table just opened up!
you go ahead, i'll stay here. if i get something on this handbag, i won't be able to return it.
stay cool, marge. stay cool... i'd like to return this handbag. unused.
well, here's your refund.
thank god! i will never do that again.
homie, you know what happens when you push your luck...
with this protective plastic overlay, i can't tell if i'm watching an old "seinfeld" or an old "old christine."
sir, this suitcase has an airline tag on it, these ping-pong balls have been served and volleyed, and this hot plate's still warm.
hello, homer.
i'm chris hansen from "to catch a credit-whore". we know you've been returning used items all over town.
anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
homie, maybe you could do it.
you know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them.
hey, dad.
cut it out! you're upsetting the gravy boat!
lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever.
what about bart's feelings?
why do you say such ridiculous things?
stealing home. it's so impossible. it's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's... it's the most exciting play in baseball! go, bart!
the isotots lose! now to begin my off-season job: follow-home robberies. i'll see you in the parking lot, but you won't see me, until it's too late.
oh homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters.
whew, sure is hot out here... 
this poor man must've been out there for days! he's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
i'm not really in the mood anymore.
poor man. you've been through so much.
god, it was horrible!
why did you do that?
no it wasn't!
please! homer, i am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous... the pie was poisoned. you were right! i guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
what do you mean, this one?
now! dear god. we just killed a man.
roger was telling the truth!
soy sauce! low sodium!
well, if it isn't my saviors.
why did you do that?
yes, i suspected our host would poison us, so i gave everyone an antidote before dinner.
we'll know.
i can't live with the guilt.
dinner is served. i tried to make what homer said you liked.
yes.
there they are!
i'm dracula, not the hulk.
yes, but at least you are safe, my son.
his blood! it's full of cholesterol!
uh, dad? they turned you into a vampire.
don'tcha want her beyond all reason?
pick a box -- you get what you get.
i can't give you another toy till you buy another ten gallons of gas.
ain't no glass.
you have a good day.
i know where we are! this is the neighborhood where i grew up! ooo, everything's changed! that tree used to be a smaller tree. and that food bank used to be a regular bank.
well, stop in and say "hi" to me 'cause i'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad.
as long as i can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every halloween.
well, as long as we don't have to feed this one.
well, um, i was looking through mom's old schoolwork, and i noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you.
no offense dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams.
that's odd. lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
she doesn't want to end up like me?!
i remember everything.
no. just a picture of lisa. who wants to be nothing like me.
the seven of clubs.
mom, dad! please, can i go here? i'll study so hard i'll make the old me look like bart.
you what?!
i have a future! thank you, mom!
um, eight o'clock.
that school is so great! teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. is mom gonna come up and say goodnight?
homer? how did you get...?
homer! stop burning! they have a vaccine!
homer, did you know he was in the pile?
no. it's better that they hear it from me. i'll tell them the truth in the simplest way i know how.
i hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes.
hm, apparently mr. burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent.
just because mr. burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless.
this town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge.
dad, mr. burns is here for you again.
a little tired of revenge, are we?
it wasn't kindness that was keeping me alive, it was bile building up inside! loathing is my life blood and rage my royal jelly! so yes, thank you, springfield, for giving me the secret to eternal life -- hate!
homer, are you scaring those kids?
like those chairs in the music room?
that coop looks a little flimsy.
wow, ray, you have hidden talents!
no, i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth.
ah, now lay off detroit. them people is living in mad max times. but i was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual springfield to shelbyville birditarod. hm?
congratulations, homer.
you brickyard bimbo!
hear that, boy? you're gonna be a racing pigeon! it's getting a little chilly -- i'd better put a blanket on ray. dad! help!
you haven't earned the right to say that to me.
how can you say a thing like that?
no he doesn't!
hey, in this economy, i'll even remove tattoos.
so, bart, as the one with the larger brain...
as sure as i am that i'll be billing you for that torn magazine.
what about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
well, "ditching" is a harsh word.
we'll take good care of your dog.
well, boy, i guess this is it. we've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption "who's walking who?"
but it's not my fault you're leaving, it's yours. because you should never, ever kill a bird. ever! i'd like a moment to ourselves.
and that last touchdown makes it sixty-seven to thirteen.
hey, simpson! how come you ain't in combat like a real man?!
don't dare bring that thing in here!
so i never want to see another christmas tree... until mom comes back, safe and sound.
see? every time we get a tree, mom disappears!
yeah. my only sale all year and it's not even a sale.
quitcher bellyaching about marge and let me read the paper.
yes, but then i learned that there's always hope. someday this war will be over. someday our mom will be back.
now this... is a challenge.
it's beginning to look a lot like breakfast... ...everywhere you go
great at the chewin', not so hot at the swallowing. hey, baby, it's moe. calling yaz from my new bachelor pad, at 742 evergreen terrace. yeah, okay, sugarplum. i'll see you soon. hey, get this off! hey, get this off!
merry humbug, everyone!
what's wrong, homie?
simpson! where's your christmas tree?
just what's going on here?
it's a christmas miraculum!
we did that one already!
i know when the freakin' fiesta bowl is!
well, well, well. simpson, you've committed springfield's first crime of the new year. write him up, lou.
failed to separate your bottles and newspapers.
that's vandalizing city property! write him up again, lou.
sorry, sir, i take no pleasure in it. oh yeah.
fine. you're "tellin' it like it is." also a crime now. and that one's gonna cost ya.
homer simpson, you are under arrest for attempted bribery of a public official.
oh, how thoughtful!
we're simpsons, dad. we don't do good behavior.
ten years. that is a long time to be away from your family.
actually, most convicts work out like crazy.
simpson, we are currently conducting a twenty-year investigation into the activities of anthony "fat tony" d'amico.
everyone knows fat tony. so we're gonna plant you in the prison with a disguise and a new name.
that's a little obvious.
no, you will be known as nicky "blue pants" altosaxophony.
now pay attention. we're gonna move in on fat tony when he takes delivery on a shipment of belgian guns. in your left sideburn is a fiber-optic camera. in your right, a wireless mic. to zoom in you go ayyyyy! to zoom out go ohhh!
time to go to work. stop licking my hand.
here's how it goes down: i rough up louie. then you stand up to me, earning his trust.
enough of your dime store morality.
hey nicky blue, you're one tough yegg. if you come out of your beatin' in one piece, you and i should have a face-to-face.
whoa! i'm impressed over here with that guy over there.
now let us escort you to freedom.
i detect a distinct lack of oregano.
you carry oregano with you?
no apology necessary. i am touched. you and me, nicky, we feel. legs, louie, jimmy the axe, tommy the face shooter -- they never share my grief.
you think an informant could get that close to me?
why you! i'm gonna chop you into pieces and make you into a rubik's cube, which i will never solve!
what's the matter, nicky? you got a problem with this job?
nicky, my friend, tonight is a big score i've been settin' up for months. just you and me -- sharing it together. to heterosexual male friendship, the kind the greeks wrote about.
all units, move in!
what? why?
get a shot of tony with the guns!
too close.
closer.
too close.
he's dead.
and i'm not gonna shake your hand.
homie, i know you had a terrible experience, but it's over.
you never took me to that bar on the beach.
sounds pretty good.
no -- i'm his cousin from san diego, fit tony.
and there's no better exercise than killing and disemboweling a big, fat snitch.
your tears seem in no way crocodilian.
well. this is awkward.
no. because my cousin lives on in your memories. and to extinguish you, would be to whack what still remains of him.
it's pretty screwed-up. that's why i keep my friends close.
no! why would i do that? if they were close, they would kill me!
why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
you know who was really happy to get back together: our husbands.
homer!
i got a text!
no, that page isn't optimized for cell phone u... why am i talking to you?
hey, how ya doin', hom--
thanks for the ride!
shh!!!
you wanna stay up and talk a while? i'm not sleepy. and anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? they went to the beach every day!
i could light these, but, it wouldn't be the same.
hey-diddily-hi, homer.
that feeling is mutual of omaha.
hey look, the late shift's leaving.
that's funny, 'cause i found this candy bar in my desk.
yah! yah! yoink! yah! yah!
so, uh, what would you gentlemen like? i mean, i know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? i'm gonna pour some beers now.
hey, what's that guy doing in the men's room?
i am not comic book guy. i am his cousin, comic book gay.
tonight on "kent's korrections," it has been brought to our attention that the word "correction" is actually spelled with a "c." we regret any confusion this may have caused.
oh no, not "the face."
can i have it, dad? can i?
are you kidding? you're the worst dad who ever lived! i'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
homer, a good father is strong enough that he doesn't need to use his strength. what bart needs is for you to strangle him with your love.
how 'bout this? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile.
what's wrong, homie?
dad, if i get an "a" on my math test, would that be worth some money?
i did it! i got an "a"!
uh, dad. if we could get to the reward...?
what the? i wanted a mini-bike! i told all my friends i was getting one!
mister homer, you inadvertently left your nuclear plant security badge in the birthday card rack.
well, i am more concerned with global terrorism. america's enemies would give anything for your nuclear knowledge.
homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. it's twenty-five years old.
dad, i was thinking about it and... you're right. you shouldn't buy me something i didn't earn. and because you gave me the tough love i didn't know i needed, i'm gonna be spending lots and lots more time with you.
you're gonna love meeting my friends. where the hell did that come from? no! why in the world would you get me this?
i've got summer squash!
well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old tv show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy.
a teddy bear made in china!
ke-shì wo-men néng xìn de guò ta huì ba hao-chi-de song-guò-lái ma?
american fatso, your knowledge helped us build this plant. we would like you to have the honor of cutting the ceremonial ribbon.
you know, dad, i really did have a good time hanging out with you.
boy, i love valentine's day. stir a drop of jägermeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry chapstick, call it "cupid's ambrosia," and you can charge up the wazoo.
my first gray hair!
homie, you always mean to say the nicest things.
we're running out of time, people! we need an answer! and it needs to be great!
what do you think, homie?
they're like dimes!
well, a girl could starve to death!
"taking down a rival," aka "talk blocking."
no, they just sawed off the ends and painted over the nubs. hey, where you goin', baby? oh no you don't. nice talk-blocking. would you be willing to wingman for me?
oh homer, i've never seen a drunk hold his vomit like you.
this is a situation i call "the doctor is out."
true beauty isn't about hair color?
but be honest, when i say "beautiful woman," what pops into your head?
hey dad, did you color your hair too?
oh hello, young man! where's your father?
bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! let's get this yo on the road, people!
well that's my tip jar!
you ate his yogurt in the car.
is bart simpson here? because i'm about to make him and his family very wealthy!
the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.
that's "angry dad"! the semi-autobiographical web cartoon i created!
homer!
mr. simpson, i'm in charge of the team that animates your ass... anything you can give us from real life?
no thanks.
hey homer! you want to be the voice of angry dad?
'angry dad: the movie.' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."
angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs.
no dad, don't say "pained noises," you make pained noises.
it's great to be here with all the old friends i haven't seen since rehab. no, no, i'm just kidding -- none of you are my friends. and now the nominees for best animated short: "the brothers of beauville." saakashvili spring. condiments by mixar...and angry dad.
uh... nobody. wrong number.
say, why ain't you at the oscars, a.d.?
that's cold.
hey, you two are honorary members for life. that means if another gang sees you, they'll kill you.
we can still order a replacement from the academy, right?
okay, we're gonna take turns having grampa as a roommate. who wants to go first?
dad, look! this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!
back off, ya mutt! or i'll make dog-head soup outta ya!
oh thank you, thank you!
so what? there are no guarantees in life! we don't know if this... knife is safe! turns out it's not. the point is, when i'm cranky, nobody likes me, sweet pea. let me live as a happy man for my remaining thirty years.
homer, why don't you just make some more of the serum yourself?
quiet. sir, has your daughter found a drug that renders old people tolerable to us normals?
oh, don't get me started on that one. they're just plain better than the greats of my day. god bless them, and their refusal to learn english.
yah, it is true, i am gloop. being stuck in that tube changed me in so many ways. gentlemen, we've been doing a lot of funny things today, but now i must be scary.
wait, i can't go in there grinnin' like a swede on payday -- it'll rile up poor lisa if she knows i'm still poppin' that smiley-pill.
no, it's cool -- it's like we've got our own monster!
/ what? well i never!
homer, use your head. just buy a new car!
you could take out a loan with your house as collateral.
pretty close to zero, i'd say.
who the hell are cheech and chong?
who are beavis and butthead?
oh man, i gotta get rid of my grass!
what are you guys doing up there?
it's me, dave, man. open up, i got the stuff.
well, how about this? chong's not here! man!
homie, you know all the bits. maybe you could help him!
homer simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. help him!
that's right. now open up the door.
just because it's too hip for you, smithers...
i don't find this funny at all.
hey man, you're alright! how'd you like to be the new chong?
and remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. save lust and rage for me and the kids.
it's not made of weed.
look, homer, i really need you to be on your game, you know? a lot of our fans have gone through rehab, so they're much more critical.
don't say that name! now, you drive -- i have to go black out his face on some t-shirts with a magic marker.
yeah, i got it. listen, man, comedy is hard work.
it is fun! the fun is the knowledge that our audience gets a good value for their hard-earned dollar!
stop that!
you did all right, kid. you earned a reward.
here's your reward!
yeah! i'm taking you to a museum, man. chong and i used to come here all the time.
now homer, this viramontes image is an example of how chicano poster art preserves a culture ignored by eurocentric society.
ah, that's just the movies, man.
now homer, what did we agree about personal phone calls during rehearsal time?
that's right. now let's take it from the part where we sniff each other's butts.
i can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
but...
you mean you put nothing over nothing!
yeah. me too!
dave's not here.
you ruined it, man -- you weren't supposed to open the door.
hey, homer?
why don't you go and get us some stuff?
all right. way down there. way, way, way far down there.
yeah, keep goin'! keep goin'! now turn the corner! turn the corner!
it's me -- relieved!
just shoot already!
simpson, your sharpened-shooting has saved my life! name your reward. anything -- just name it!
lower and likelier.
ooh, the "fan cam!"
eh. this song's a little bossy for me.
stop it!
cut it out!
dad, how could you do that? the whole audience saw me pee my pants!
homer! just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!
...taking pity on the boy, the operators of springfield stadium opened the stadium's retractable roof in an attempt to dry his pants. unfortunately, the stain was picked up by russian spy satellites, and president dmitry medvedev has taken the pants-wetting as a sign of american weakness. a russian flotilla has just entered new york harb--
and i wouldn't blame him. you destroyed our son's self-esteem.
what?
you can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
that's great. then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
there's one right here!
uh, homer, it says here you've been a father for ten years. what has that taught you?
wait. hold on a moment. you were strangling your son?
you're actually serious! you physically lay your hands on your boy's neck?
um... why don't we stop there for today... and i'll see you next week.
i had eighty-six assists! but today he's here to assist me with you.
homer, it's time you understood what it feels like to be young, small, and terrified.
fool-hearty... tattooed...
i believe we've made excellent progress here today. and after another few years of twice-weekly sessions we can really...
good for you. no more drinkin'?
i just got up, man.
fine.
aw, my son's first stroke. say cheeese!
oh yeah? look.
fill the board then wash my car.
what was that?
homer! homer!
now bart, i want you to guide your father safely through these cacti.
homer, desperate times call for desperate measures. if you hop down from that limb, i assure you bart will cut you down.
this is a tough neck! oh, it's so strong! like an old...
thanks, dad.
actually, we pay them for each peach we take home.
okay, we've got peach bruschetta on peach toast, peach-aroni peach-za, and my famous b.l.t.s -- or should i say p.p.p.s? c'mon, people. peaches!
what?! what? what will we eat? oh screw it.
and george washington took a trip down the...ear-y canal!
aye ca-rum-ba.
a peanut-butter-and-pretzel sandwich? there's no way a stupid flanders like me could ever have thought of this.
i can't! i never learned how!
hey dad, there's an arcade across the street... and there's really no point in all of us waiting in line...
next!
dad, aunt selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer.
i hope i'm not interrupting.
i'm sorry, fat tony. my husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:
vi dichiaro marito e presunta moglie. you may now kiss one another.
no!
he's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result.
i still can't believe it. i have never been so snubbed at one of selma's weddings.
we have towels.
i don't think this is a good idea at all. the only husband of selma's i liked was disco stu. he was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
these people are always grinding against each other, and i think they're all related. i wish we'd never come.
boo-frickin'-ya! losers chug!
the boys needed to breathe.
goomar?! that's mob talk for "mistress." fat tony has a mistress!
well, homer and i are going to take you away right now.
whoa! you don't wanna be "that guy."
in a good marriage, you never say i told you so.
bart, i'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser.
why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
i didn't do diddily, and certainly not squat! actually, it's kind of cute. you look like posh spice.
one hundred.
wow! hello, airport piano bar! and it'll look good in the morning, too! are you sure you don't have a salon?
too bad.
i'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. but i never knew you were so good with hair.
well... newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors.
all day long, apu goes on about lady gaga, who is doing nothing that rava khatan was not doing twenty years ago, while she was a member of parliament!
because i have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. turns out it was a substitute.
i know kirk resents that the dog likes me more, but rex is just establishing dominance over the weaker male. that's what miniature dachshunds do.
homer, can you make me look fan-cy?
but tonight's the policemen's ball! and if you let my sarah down i can make life very difficult for you.
huh, where you goin'?
uh-uh-uh!
what? no! just cut her hair!
homer? i thought you were gonna quit.
why don't you do here what you do at the nuclear plant -- namely, suck.
so, i told timothy, you cannot keep basing sermons on old seinfelds...
that's right, ladies. and i never heard a complaint i didn't sympathetically cluck to. that's how i roll. okay, first five customers get a discount. next five hear secrets about the first five. come on, get in line. it worked perfectly. as if anyone but you can make me feel this beautiful.
homie, you're making my toes curl. you sure know how to please a woman.
returned because of a fight over the pre-nup.
she wanted a cake with blue rosettes, he slept with her sister.
what's wrong?
that's the key to my box with the real skull.
so how come we have all these other keys?
homer, stop him!
duffman doesn't need duff to have fun! seriously, you got any beer?
hey homer, i really had you going there, huh? homer?
pull over! before somebody gets hurt!
but it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
what videogame is this like?
for wii or xbox?
original or three-sixty?
yes! and i've got gum on my shoe!
oh, i'm sorry, homie.
in all my years of teaching, i've never raised a hand to a student.
uh seymour, who's running this meeting?
you've been in there for three hours! what are you doing, taking a bath?
it's not funny at all. homer, i'd appreciate it if you weren't so rude to ned.
language.
don't do that, homie. it rubs off your side hair.
see, dad? having krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. we're natural enemies, like george washington and abraham lincoln.
oh my.
yeah, let me guess. you're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' edna.
homer, listen to me. for a long time now i've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with marge. then i remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine. someone to hold the other end of the sheet when i fold it up. someone to put in my prayers.
that's right. and like any man, i put on my secret christian underpants one leg at a time.
my email address is edna-lover-one-seventy-two. it was the lowest number i could get!
wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
well homer, you really put one over on old stupid flanders, here. thanks a lot, neighbor.
no. just plain neighbor.
well, there's ned out on his power walk. maybe you should talk to him.
and country!
so we're going to let the internet decide. should ned and edna stay together? visit thesimpsons.com and vote. we'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
homer! stop teasing!
good evening. tonight we reveal to you the fate of nedna. i have devoted my summer to a more meaningful task: savaging mr. popper's penguins online. anyway, the answer to ned and edna is carefully hidden in tonight's episode like a breadcrumb lodged inside my stomach crease. enjoy.
hi, homer!
i wouldn't know, sir.
not interested.
violent ward.
i prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers. it, um... hasn't worked out for me in the past.
hey, wayne.
did you have a hard day too?
no, i was tipsy last night when a telephone survey called, so i told them to call back tonight for more accurate answers.
i can walk. all right, homer. you win.
every town i go to i run into some guy just like this.
...and i don't want you calling me at home and saying "turn on channel six"...
thanks for the upgrade. ha-ha!
my fresco! that's coming out of your stealings! that's comin' out of your stealings!
sorry. i have to go.
hey simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?
really? are you sure?
i don't know. i've got no job... no references... can't afford my apartment. i have recurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past.
un-fair! un-fair!
my nightmares are real.
and when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got lou gehrig's disease.
i am looking for a man named wayne.
are you friend of his?
i see you are tight like borscht and beets. tell me, if we kidnapped a friend of wayne's, would he attempt to rescue that friend?
stick to script!
hold up today's newspaper!
perhaps we'll be living in a world where there'll be no need to kidnap.
shut up!
so, wayne, once again you crash my party.
stop it!
you ever eat on a train, marge? what they call a steak is barely a hamburger. now homer, there's one more thing before i go.
buy a springfield elementary t-shirt?
mr. simpson, i know you're not one of our wealthier parents, but surely you'll honor your son's enormous debt.
hear hear! hear hear!
how could we be? we're all in the same place and we don't have computers.
that's great, homie! come have some ice cream on a brownie!
well, dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe i should tell you...
come in and get some more!
he's not a bad boy. he had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
yes, i'm afraid we are.
okay handsome, that's enough primping! just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
dad, i'm going to entertain you with the help of "the brothers karamazov." "alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which i shall describe in its proper place."
shhh. don't say a word.
homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? mr. burns, sideshow bob...
really?
hey, dad.
well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so i can't see the board.
you made a killer out of me!
hell! damn! backside! nothing matters anymore! i'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two! wake up, flanders! there is no hell, and there is no god. if there were, would he let me do this?
roz davis, your new assistant.
i'm just a gal from ohio who never wants to call her daddy again and say "i need to borrow money."
genius.
well, when it's a handsome guy like you talkin'...
what made you think of that?
precisely -- and at science fairs, the "awws" get the "a's." heavens to asimov! hmmm... must make sure these wires aren't crossed.
and best of all i got funding for my homer humiliator.
simpson! a gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the biograph.
you're demoted.
enjoy. and as for you, homer, don't worry. you're at moe's tavern -- lady-free since eighty-three.
aren't you gonna come to bed, homie?
late.
now, i want a list of a hundred ways to make your job worse by close of business today.
no.
well, looks like it's time for another "'end of the walk' talk with homer and ned." tonight's topic: "the niceness of the evening."
y'know, i knew a backstabbin' buckeye named roz at bible camp. twice as tall as she should've been.
it is! but if you've got the stones, i can tell you how to slay that gal-ioth.
and i haven't. not until now.
oh that's nice, but i don't approve of--
what are you doing here, simpson? if there isn't dry-cleaning in the back of my car, there's gonna be blood on my knuckles.
who told you?
stupid flanders.
i underestimated you.
it's how i view you. you understand that?
i used to think you were an idiot. now it turns out you're not such an idiot, in fact, you might even be smart.
rub the butter around you.
video game convention!
games don't have lives or points anymore, dad.
this is the funnest game ever!
dad! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g!
room's full.
the kids sure had a good time with you.
how come they never call me "fun mom?"
it's not fair. moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff.
what if... we roll pennies and go to the dollar store!
relax, homie. have some leftover galalalalalalalalah.
aw, come on, dad, be a foodie! you're already a fatty and a drunkie!
i feel bad for all those places that didn't make the cut.
hey hey, kids! krustyland has a new ride! the eyeballs of death! it only passed the safety panel by a three to two vote! and that third vote didn't come cheap!
don't be so jealous, homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me.
of what?
what are you doing?
homie, i don't want you to feel excluded. would you like to come with us to dinner at el chemistri?
why?
ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!
oh, i doubt it. you sit at communal tables, full of hipsters.
and the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. it's too crazy for you.
what do you want?
quiet, man!
fifty bucks.
you don't look like the kind of guy who does this.
sure, your dad's great, but i'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! d'oh! d'oh! d'oh! who am i kidding? i'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. i'm calling homer.
this is nice -- a family fun day!
... the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years -- until a massive asteroid collided with the earth, bringing their reign to an end.
how is that the lesson? the point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. so we should party hard and wreck the place.
what? he gets four and i only get two?! no fair!
wait! wait! come back! dad! follow that dinosaur!
stegosaurus backplates, used for either defense or control of body temperature, comin' through!
everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie!
can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
every book on the "young adult" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!
and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! it's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
whatever the job is, i'm not interested.
chapter-book crowd? that's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?
tween-lit gang-write?
a zephyr?
this better not turn out like kansas city.
wait, wait, wait, wait, i want in! what does your crew need? a safecracker? a wheel man?
uh, yes.
i keep going over the job from every angle, but i can't shake the feeling that we're missing something.
i'll show you! i'll write a book myself! a personal story my readers will connect with!
perhaps someone of my experience would be a valuable addition to your "crew."
it's good. "weekly reader star selection" good.
who wants to see my cover mock-up?!
hope you don't mind us printing our book in your room, lis.
this is a really good book.
coming to the book fair was a great idea... 'cause you can't write if you don't know what the competition's up to! a dog wrote a bestseller?! aargh! all i've done is procrastinate! who am i kidding? there will never be a book with my name on it.
do i have to do any writing?
the trolls are now vampires, the brooklyn bridge is now a castle, and fuzzlepitch is now bloodball! oh! weak! weak! and lame!
no.
what you're feeling is called "pride of authorship." you thought you only cared about money, but you actually care more about what you've created together.
kansas city.
so, you thought you would un-ruin your book. if it's any consolation, you never had a chance.
you could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password... so i pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password... i secretly switched the flash drives.
your cotillion seems to be in full promenade.
i have sixteen million songs, but, uh, no.
come josephine in my flying machine!
simpson, you're probably wondering why you're here.
when i made you a hoop you split your pants! now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. i'd like you to take over that position.
yes. simpson, only you have the bonhomie and rotund charm to replace him. it means a hefty expense account and a corner office.
before you say yes, simpson, i feel it's my duty to warn you... ...account men lose their soul.
hey, you're a baby account man. still on the bottle. so for my last good deed before i retire, i'm gonna help you persuade mayor quimby to sign off on a nuclear rate hike.
there ain't enough bourbon in kentucky for you, big guy.
hey homer! / look at you, man!
and if you don't like the score you can change it yourself.
great. now in honor of my last day on the hamster wheel, i have a little gift for you. this set of bar tools has been passed down from account man to account man since the dawn of history... 1956.
dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story.
i'll read! i'll read!
does anybody want my opinion?
homie, what are you doing?
you make electricity. it runs the hospital!
that's because it would kill you.
i'm your wife.
your wife is here, mr. s.
homer, i want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation.
the farthest thing from this office i know: rafting down rattler river canyon.
don't talk to me like i'm a client!
rafting, eh? it's a perfect way to entertain them. finally, humanity has found a use for water.
coggily-doggily.
but mr. s... you just promised this week to mrs. s, master b., and mamselles l. and m.!
and maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
and yarn should be allowed to marry dental floss!
are you sure you're martin scorsese?
take us out first! anyone can start a family! these days, no one can find a job!
hurry! we're heading for the falls!
well, simpson, you were willing to let me go over a waterfall, but you cut operating expenses by six percent, so you're forgiven.
oh, i'm so glad you're not an accounts man anymore.
we have to see the museum of tv before next wednesday when it closes forever.
whoa! the gun sheriff baby wore! hm.
isn't that just a rip-off of "the honeymooners?"
just you wait, eunice! just you wait. ka-chik, kaboom, ka-splatter! see yer grave there?
the size forty-eights. that's when he was the funniest.
i was fatso's agent. annie dubinsky. if you ever hear a star's name and wonder "is he dead?" the answer is either i represent him, or "yes."
come on in, it's a long story.
i was so mad at him, i didn't have sex with a clown for five months.
they're pretty funny. once i used one on milhouse. he was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out.
i hereby declare thanksgiving dinner officially over! which means, it's the start of christmas season...which means...
i see you are reading a children's book. yet your profile indicates you are a mature adult. is there an error?
why do you say "future?" this is now.
i just got a message from maggie in my brain.
she's coming home for christmas! and bart's bringing the boys! and lisa's coming with zia! for once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!
hey grampa. are you gonna build a snowman?
thanks for spending so much time with us, dad.
are they working on one?
ah, i don't see what's great about 'em! and homer, you're still a big disappointment. because...
you've taught us the meaning of christmas, which schools are forbidden to tell us any more.
no, one of the freezers is busted.
lawn chair-breakin'-- hair-losin'-- marge-lovin' barometer-dropping-- father-freezin'-- but you'd always come and get me when i wandered out on the freeway -- 'cause deep down you couldn't bear to see me smooshed.
next!
sorry sir, your bag is two pounds over the limit. are you sure everything inside is essential?
i told you not to pack them!
they self-reference each other.
that's toothpaste! that's toothpaste!
sir, you've been selected for a pat-down.
sir, there isn't enough room.
welcome to flight 55 to bozeman, montana by way of miami. due to an unforeseen jailbreak in new south wales, our takeoff is gonna be just a little bit delayed. so we're gonna be turning off the air, but ethnic people are permitted to open and eat their home-cooked food.
sir, return to your seat.
i need backup! come on, ladies. you're all deputies now.
"fatso goes nutso!" and post to youtube with the following key words "fat," "stupid," "classic simpsons," and, just to be safe, "baby rides kitten rides penguin." perfect.
well, the hot dogs spin counterclockwise in fear whenever you are near, sir. why are you in disguise?
when i heard homer speak i no longer felt small.
that's a great point, adriatica.
homie, you can win this argument! just rant and rave like you do to the tv during sports!
and we're back with homer simpson, who's about to become a soggy pamper flung to the side of history's freeway in three.. two...
from now on when someone asks me, i'm gonna say you are my father.
that's not you. they just painted shrek yellow.
dad, i'm glad your show is successful, but i have to ask you: what's with the crying?
no, we're out.
homie, i'm glad you're passionate, i just hope you're not riling people up with your show.
you know, symbols can often rile people up. the swastika... the new york yankees logo...
speaking for lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore.
um, none.
dad, you shouldn't do this. it's not fair how much influence you have!
save me, obama care!
dad, you cannot endorse ted nugent. i mean, sure, we all love his music...
arise, homer simpson!
now come, and i shall teach you of democracy!
actually, i'm on the five thousand dollar bill.
i want to show you something.
these are the framers of the constitution, homer. this great nation is built upon the hard work of, well as you would say, "nerds."
i want you should not mess! you are an embarrassment to the aristocratic slaveholders who forged this mighty nation!
homie, wake up.
oh, dad! i'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason.
i did it just to mess with your mind.
no strangling on school days!
come on, hurry up and cry so i can get elected and open up the san diego zoo for big game huntin'.
maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing.
well, for one brief, glorious moment, i was almost president, sort of, not really. now let me just play a sweet song that i'll never hear. hail to me / i'm the presidential gonzo / hunt with a bow 'cause it's silent like the night / eat mooses raw / so their souls go into my soul / i'll move the white house to kalamazoo! there is a new national anthem that is sweepin' the land / and it was written by me / and it popped into my head while i was washing my dog / suck on that francis scott key...
sing it, homer!
well, mcbain. you certainly picked a bad time to come out of retirement. i hope you have a... cobra plan.
homie! stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
you'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
someone thinks we're leaving. i'll wave them off.
dammit, are you leaving or not?
we totally wasted his time.
i was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. better sort those out.
i already have.
okay.
wow, i've created something incredibly popular!
and i created an alcoholic hippo!
a stupid alcoholic hippo!
'cause you're the hippo!
no. we want your dad.
polo!
you were only supposed to lead us in the pledge of allegiance.
i was part of an expedition to the top of mount everest. one that had the distinction of failing un-heroically.
why does the guy have to do everything for the girl on valentine's day?
homie, read this. "my darling husband. this valentine's day, i have a present for you..."
it's okay, homie. go. have a good time. take bart with you!
oh, my. i don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before.
my mother said i should bring some wine.
she wants to steal a kiss, like pyramus and thisbe.
all springfielders should now move off the streets and inside their homes. please avoid the superstitious panic which marked the recent lunar eclipse.
again, i maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance.
i pick up books like you pick up beers!
now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
homie! what if that was the last thing you ever said?
i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
what's going on? why is there a picture of us? this isn't good.
why would you want to banish us from springfield?
i'm glad you asked. the simple fact is, the city is going broke cleaning up after homer's drunken shenanigans...
if you see a simpson, do not try to reason with it. just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda.
dad, where are we going? do we have a plan?
hey, henrietta hippo, i've got to drain the inchworm.
i just got started!
oh, i wouldn't be openin' no windows. coyotes will take your baby. the out-lands!
should i get my helmet?
is there gas in these?
well how are we supposed to get fuel?
don't be ridiculous. it's an afghan wedding being bombed.
he's no ned flanders. and i miss the springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. god help me, i even miss helen lovejoy criticizing my brownies.
yes it does.
homie, these disguises won't fool anyone.
look! a shooting star!
wanna make out over the foul line?
yeah, this place is awesome, but it's not puppy safe, and my little guy's coming tomorrow.
that is pretty smart.
then get them a subscription to the opera!
don't even bother shooting us. we've found a new place that we love. a place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more...
you sure this is a good idea?
i'm-i'm-i'm here as a friend, looking for a better way of life!
no!
hey! guys! what can i getcha?
i probably shouldn't have given this place five stars on yelp.
i, uh, heard everything was goin' great in your new eden, with one flaw: you lack a corrupt city government.
wha--? mom is gonna love that!
by who? lenny?
they have jellies made of fruits i've never heard of! these'll go great with betel nut butter!
oh really?
defend yourself, sir! convenience forever, freshness never!
how would you like it if i called your wife live from my show tomorrow to wish her a happy birthday?
oh bart, you got me the fluffy pet i've never stopped thinking about! now, last but not least, your present, homie.
well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good.
homie, whatever it is, it's not happening.
well, at least you remembered i like her.
aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity.
i think that's enough birthday fun.
don't wanna come out.
i like it in the cage. these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
but it's my home now, sir.
fine.
no, no, i'm too concerned with unemployment.
homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?
i carumba? not so loud! if my dad hears about the show, he might realize mr. fatso is him!
c'mon, dad. you made me mad so i got back at you. how was i to know parents had feelings?
correction. it's worth ten times as much.
you're welcome. and from now on, dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me.
wait, is the hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?
well, we've gotta teach him a lesson somehow.
can someone open this bottle of mother wolf placenta for me?
only one of you monkeys wasn't caught with his sticky paw in my tin cup... homer simpson!
now simpson, how is it that you alone manage to keep your moral compass pointed to true north?
that's a lotta eights! i can't believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!
why? are you going to do the laundry?
ho-mer! you do not yet understand the meaning of kar-ma!
that is beside the point, okay? if something bad is happening to you, it must be because of something you did to others.
who the hell are you?
ain't no problem that free food and free booze won't fix!
what's going on?
what's goin' on? is this a joke?
what is going on?
i'm sorry, homie. a diaper just isn't sexy.
he's a baby with wings!
you wet the bed?!
what do you see?
in this fantasy kwik-e-mart, you get your change in bacon.
homie! we're here to find answers to your problem! we know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...
...death.
no, but i live on in homer's dreams.
now i have something to show you. something that just might help homer wake up dry.
man, homer, you've always been a loser.
pathetic. a kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.
and maybe you'll stop overeating too!
we'll take your word for it.
spin the top. if it falls over, we're in reality. if it spins forever, we're still in a dream.
sounds like a plan! is that hail coming down?
think he's okay?
some casual friday this is.
homie! you're home early!
company physical coming up, huh?
...you promised to help me write a haiku...
homie, what are you drinking?
there's champagne in those!
no! irish and long island!
mike's hard!
suzette!
wow, passed with flying colors! i've sure earned this!
more high-tech than kangaroos? ladies and gentlemen, meet the future masters of the human race.
so we need one meat sock on the payroll. but who?
yes.
homer, show a little more sensitivity around these jobless washouts, huh?
the buyer clearly specified violin and bow!
human interaction mode activated. initiate conversation.
sounds like you are having... family difficulties.
we are programmed to respond to your verbal prompts.
hmmm... your laughter indicates you do not wish us to give your wife lessons.
five.
we are the same temperature we have always been.
according to the online rules of baseball, all players get a turn "at bat."
the designated hitter corrupts the purity of an otherwise elegant game... illogical, illogical.
circuit-bunching has yielded important advances in modern robotics. to wit...
our primary directive... is to preserve human life.
homer... move away from me. you are still in the road.
can i hollow out this one's head and use it as a turtle tank?
alcohol is harmful to humans.
homer, when am i gettin' my power drill back?
uh, homer, i'm afraid this is the part of god's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots.
eliminate impediment. eliminate.
dad, they can only go three miles an hour!
fine! slink away! and guess what: all those times i said "you're a good boy," it was a lie! no! stop! i'll give you the combination to the num-num safe! flee, you fool!
stop brandishing me!
to servos with love!
i told you precisely that fact one thousand five hundred sixty-two t--
i am real and i do not have wishes.
i am not a transformer. i cannot turn into an outboard motor.
that movie's for babies.
sir, i can't help but noticing that you are very near death.
i'm not required to tell you that. homer, how long do you want to live?
well, i want to help you make it to that glorious day. for money. this is the butt-whisperer 9000: cushioned track...
hydration dock...
built-in hd tv...
run, you maggot! faster, you tub of lard!
homer, you can't afford three hundred dollars a month?
well, what about ten dollars a day?
why did i see that movie the day before i have to clean the crawlspace?
wow, the tv's hooked up to the internet! you can stream whole seasons of old tv shows.
"stranded" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. it was huge! well, the first season and the last season.
where are we??
i'm just not ready for cookies!
homer! you're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? and when i wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!
it means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
on the tv!
on the ground!
it means i'm mad!
hey, i loved that show. wasn't it awesome when colonel darkwater--
so you don't know that season five was a complete wank.
homer, calm down. it's not like any of this stuff really took place.
you wanna know what happens on your stupid show? firstly, the "mysterious island" is fifteen miles from long beach. also, doorway three led to hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to hell, and the entire strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!
care to join me in a private "last episode party"?
it's okay, dad. he's just putting the fear of god in me.
i'm sorry, sweetie. maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at "mr. steak."
face it, we're just kids. we can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. all we have in the world are the things our parents give us.
