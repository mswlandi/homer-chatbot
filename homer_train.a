well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and i will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. hmm?
maybe we could see something a little more adult.
ooh! the paper called it a "taut political thriller".
get me jed kolick!
well of course he's a spy. you just saw him go through spy school!
homie, aren't you coming inside?
them's fightin' words!
we don't sell duff. we sell fudd.
our next act is our very own singin' waitress, lurleen! ... so, i'm afraid drink service will stop for just a few moments while she -- they're all yours.
thank you. tonight i'd like to try something a little different. it's a song i wrote while i was moppin' up your dried blood and teeth. you work all day for some old man/ sweat and break your back/
then you go home to your castle/ but your queen won't cut you slack/
that's why you're losin' all your hair/... that's why you're overweight/...
that's why you flipped your pick-up truck right off the interstate/...
there's a lot of bull they hand you/ there's nothin' you can do/ your wife don't understand you/ but i do/ no, your wife don't understand you/ but i do/ i said no one understands you/ but i do/
i'm listenin'.
so what's your name, stranger?
my name's lurleen lumpkin.
oh, you think so?
where were you all night?
you should have called. i was very worried.
fudd? i thought they took that off the market after all those hillbillies went blind.
well, if it isn't homer j. simpson.
oh, aren't you sweet.
sorry, darlin', all my songs are up here. "i'm bastin' a turkey with my tears", "don't look up my dress unless you mean it", "i'm sick of your lyin' lips and false teeth"...
well, i don't know.
homer, it's your quarter, what do you say?
country music sucks. all it does is take precious air space away from shock dj's whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
well, it's nice. but who is this woman?
i don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
oh homer, everybody's been callin'! mamma, daddy, the triplets, vonda mae, piney jo... and i owe it all to you.
oh homer, no man has ever been this nice to me without... you know, wantin' somethin' in return.
homer, you're just a big sack of sugar.
uh-huh. now, homer, i want you to be my manager.
that's okay.
nobody's perfect.
i didn't even go.
i don't want to. i'm mad at you. i'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing.
homer! where did you get that suit?
was it lurleen?
don't lie to me. are you having an affair with this woman?
have you kissed her?
has she kissed you?
i want you to stop seeing her.
her manager? that's ridiculous. i won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. and you did it at the county fair last year. remember?
this studio has a lot of history. buddy holly stood on this spot in 1958 and said, "there is no way in hell that i'm gonna record in this dump".
homer, how much did you just give that man?
hmmm. i thought you said she was overweight!
hey dad, can i do a ham-bone solo?
lurleen, we're gonna have to cut you off. we're getting some kind of grinding noise on the track.
oh homer! you're as smart as you are handsome.
well, i have been working on something that could really heat things up.
in this trailer, i get so cold and lonely/ lyin' there awake at night/ muttering if only you weren't married/ so i might ask you to bunk with me tonight/ bunk with me tonight/ oh bunk with me tonight/ i'm askin' will you bunk with me tonight?
uh, homer, there's a hidden message to this song that you may have missed. really listen. bunk with me tonight...
bunk with me tonight...
that's right homer j.
i gotta go. homer...
just so you know, while you and lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, maggie cut her first tooth.
you're not even listening to me!
kids, will you come in here? you've got a wonderful family, homer. please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight.
excuse me, are you colonel homer simpson?
i'm from rebel yell records, a division of togasaki corp. i'm interested in buying lurleen's contract.
well thank you -- i'm still a little itchy from that fiberglass hay.
well... you could make my evening complete. what's wrong?
no!
i'll love you for the rest of my life.
uh-huh.
i'll give you fifty bucks.
homer?
these talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on tv.
now kids, i know you're all excited about meeting aunt selma's new boyfriend tonight.
ewww.
that's right, aunt selma. your new boyfriend here framed krusty the clown for armed robbery.
ahh, mr. simpson, you're forgetting the first two noble truths of the buddha.
indeed, i did. and i'd like to thank you for catching me, bart. you seized the wheel of my slow boat to hell and pointed it straight towards the sunny shores of selma.
now, about your wedding dress. i'm not sure how to put this... white. and what would you like for appetizers?
well homer, you seem to be a trencherman. what should we serve?
very well. i... i... i can't do it! even that car chase seemed tacked on.
aunt selma has one hour to live!
her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father. dad, when aunt selma lights up her cigarette at the end of macgyver, she'll be blown to kingdom come!
after trying four times to explain it to homer, i explained it to mom and we were on our way.
hey homer, let's book! i want to get there in time to whip eggs at the warm-up act.
my little guy's first rock concert. i hope the spinal taps don't play too loud.
hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything.
thanks, dad. sure you're not gonna be bored?
we'll discuss it later. is milhouse okay?
homer, i've been thinking about what bart said. if he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should buy him a guitar.
i meant a real guitar.
and it came with a free instruction book.
homer!
mom, can otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? he sure can!
that's not my voice!
the admiral and i don't get along. please let me stay here. i've got nowhere else to go.
i know we didn't ask for this, homer, but doesn't the bible say, "whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"
please, dad. if you let otto stay, he'll help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can.
what's on?
because... i was that maniac! hey, hey, i was just kidding.
but homer, we're the only family he's got...
heyyy, mr. s...
we start with pure milk chocolate...
add a layer of farm-fresh honey...
dad, what if i told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?
according to eternity magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. that's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.
they'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. as you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less.
hmmm... hostage negotiations.
homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?
i don't know if that tape is working. you ate three desserts tonight.
there's another thing i've been wanting to talk to you about...
dad! dad! do you know what today is?
no. it's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. let's get you on the scale. you've gained thirteen pounds.
you mean a spoon?
this can't be right. this man has 104% body fat! hey, no eating in the tank!
how was your day at work, dear?
homer!
and now, the next event...in our living room olympics... the always controversial, couch vault. i do this for stain master carpets. proud sponsor of the living room olympics.
there, there. you're safe now, little sister.
"well, i never thought i'd see it. they're dancing on the berlin wall. these lithe and lively lovers of liberation..."
pyle!
yeah, you gonna to be okay?
ah, simpson, you big virile son-of-a- gun. how would you like a check for two-thousand dollars?
all you have to do is sign this form.
all right, well, it just explains that you've won -- yes, that's it -- won the first annual... uh... montgomery burns... uh... award for... a-a-a outstanding achievement in...a-a th... th.. the field of... uh, excellence!
webster's dictionary defines excellence as "the quality or condition of being excellent". and now, the winner of the first annual montgomery burns award for outstanding achievement in the field of excellence.
dad, you know you won.
the winner... homer simpson!
you cleaned me out smokin' joe. what's the matter homer? cummerbund too tight?
i know how you feel. you lost a couch. i lost a heavyweight championship.
let's do it.
but sir...
dad? dad?
this chair is $2,000. we could buy a whole living room set for that.
this money was a blessing. we can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
bart... lisa. i'm so glad to see you.
i'm sorry, homer. but i'm still mad at you. every word you say just makes me want to punch you in the face.
can't complain.
homer, he knows how to work a light switch.
i got the recipe from the utility grade beef counsel.
that's all i got.
well, i think we should invest in a set of the great books of western civilization. look at this ad from "new republic for kids." each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: "paradise regained," "martin chuzzlewit," or herman melville's twin classics "omoo" and "typee".
how would you like to spend two thousand dollars to give a broken man a second chance?
up-up-up-up. not here. come into the dining room. i want to give you a twenty-minute presentation that will change the world.
okay. now, before i tell you about my idea, i'd like to show you this.
take it easy, homer. now this is an example of how one little idea -- carefully marketed...
no, homer. that invention is out already. i'm just using it as an example.
dad, you know some shyster's gonna bilk you out of your money. it may as well be your brother.
nope.
what do you think, homer?
homer, could you stop thinking about your ass!
well, homer, now what do you think?
i have soiled myself. how embarrassing.
don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. he is your brother.
homer, walk me to my car.
this is what you get, homer. i forgive you. you can call me brother and i can do the same.
that's it.
gimme a hug, brother.
oh, i dreamt it was the last day of school.
homie, you do remember your promise to the children?
yeah. well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. it now goes: d,b,a,c.
but dad...
8...
well, here goes nothin'.
well, dad, here's my report card. i think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
no, sir.
so i won't get to go to camp?
you mean i can go?
oh, dad. you're the best father a boy could ever have!
ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the bart philosophy, but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty.
hey, hands off my pickle.
no, but...
good-bye my special little guy. lisa, watch out for poison ivy. remember, "leaves of 3, let it be.
you can have the shower to yourself, homie. i'm finished.
ohhh...
oh, that's wonderful.
dear kids, i hope this letter finds you well. we are doing great. your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever.
oh... homer, it's getting late, we'll miss the fireworks.
i haven't been in a play since high school, and i thought it would be a good chance to meet some other adults.
you know, i spend all day alone with maggie... and sometimes it's like i don't even exist.
it's time to name our five finalists, starting with... miss montana!
miss south carolina!
miss delaware!
la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
tonight, my reign as miss american girl comes to an end. and i'd like to apologize one last time for my unfortunate remarks at the united nations.
i'm auditioning for a play.
i told you several times. it's a musical version of "a streetcar named..."
well... i thought i told you..
sorry.
i'm sorry, honey.
i don't think so.
homer, can you run some lines with me?
gutterball.
i'm sorry, llewellyn. i just... i just don't see why blanche should shove a broken bottle in stanley's face. couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?
marge! marge! i'm asking for white hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit!
oh here!
stanley is thoughtless, violent and loud. marge, every second you spend with this man, he is crushing your fragile spirit. you can't let that happen.
all i want is one embrace.
heah you ah, homah.
can i slog off school tomorrow? got a pain in me gulliver.
see you later, kids. ah've got to go rehearse with ned.
for god's sake, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding!
why? are you going?
i'm sure you won't enjoy it. there's nothing about bowling in the play... oh wait, there is.
why can't you be a little more supportive?
what kooky projects?
why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
hi kids! i'm flame retardant! if i break, buy a new one
it's mom!
almost everybody.
lookin' for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guv'nor?
oh, come on, homer. by the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up.
blanche.
really?
get up, homer. it's time for church.
it's church. you have to go.
i'm tired of having this argument every sunday. get dressed.
come on. we're going to be late.
it's eleven kbbl degrees below zero. i hope you're someplace warm.
who wears short shorts?
of course, johnny's next record was a spoken-word album of his right-wing political views, that kinda killed his career. if you can tell me the name of that album, call our contest line - now!
homer, can you name that title?
uh... can we accept that?
you heard the lady - grab her spine and get cracking.
let's define our terms, gentleman. are we talking about redistricting, or are we talking about reapportionment? because the two are by no means the same.
we interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.
oh, doctor. a 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63! we have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today. three visits from morganna the kissing bandit... and the astonishing return of jim brown...
mmm, hmm.
that's a terrible thing to say. kids, your father doesn't really mean that.
homer! are you actually giving up your faith?
i can't believe you're giving up church, homer.
amen, brother.
tell it, daddy!
lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. please show him the error of his ways.
no, homer. he doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, lord. he just likes to sleep in on sundays...
thou hast forsaken my church!
but what?
hmm, you've got a point there. you know, sometimes even i'd rather be watching football. does st. louis still have a team?
oh yeah.
i couldn't agree more. that reverend lovejoy really displeases me. i think i'll give him a canker sore.
i will.
dad, can i ask you a question?
why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy?
no, it's nothing bad. i'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately.
oh, really?
so, homer, you saw the big cheese? what'd he look like?
homer, i'd like you to remember matthew 7:26 -- "the foolish man, who built his house on sand." "and he left them, and went out of the city into bethany, and he lodged there"?
pretty slick.
neighbor, i heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock.
get those animals out on the arky, arky -
i see him, son.
i have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, i'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked.
kids, could you wait outside for us? homer, please. don't make me choose between my man and my god, because you just can't win.
coming up next, "make your own ladder."
hello. i'm collecting for the brotherhood of jewish clowns. last year, tornadoes claimed the lives of seventy-five jewish clowns. the worst incident was during our convention in lubbock, texas. there were floppy shoes and rainbow wigs everywhere... it was terrible...
a religious clown thing, yes.
oh, but i am. i have a shrine to ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.
please do not offer my god a peanut.
homer! homer! nooo! dear lord, may your loving hand guide homer to the mattress square and true. o-kay.
heck, you'd have done the same for me. help! help!
oh, homey! are you all right?
truly this was an act of god.
any valuables in the house?
sorry, this policy only covers actual losses, not made-up stuff.
coming up next... which works better - springy clothes pins, or the other kind?
yes, the lesson is...
ah, that's super.
now, would you give church another try?
that's game, hendrix!
homer, i can't tell you that.
you'll find out when you die.
you can't wait six months?
i'd say... 53 years old and 420 pounds.
now in a moment, we'll be raffling off our grand prize... a ride on the famous duff beer blimp!
you see the circular pattern on those fields? that's from central-pivot irrigation.
oops! sorry.
we have one at home. you never use it.
and the winner of the blimp ride is... homer simpson!
dad, do you think i'm ugly?
i'm an ugmo.
fathers have to say that stuff.
no! you're homely as a mule's butt!
mmmm... no.
not for a second .
what a feeling! i'm as happy as a smoker taking that first puff in the morning.
sure!
no! no! i meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.
to shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.
what are you talking about?
homer, lisa's already sensitive about her looks. this is the last thing she needs.
dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? hubba, hubba.
you're looking at her through a father's eyes.
but that ride meant everything to him!
like what?
i know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
whooo! whooo! dad, do you know anything else about women?
my name is lisa simpson, and i want to be little miss springfield so i can make our town a better place!
ooh, that just kept goin' huh? and now here's... ... lisa simpson!
thanks, dad.
but you're a role model to young people. and we're thinking of retiring "menthol moose".
homer, those are ice cream men.
dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?
possibly. but the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. and i do.
uh-huh.
hey homer - where's your present?
hey!
we sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread. we also sell frozen yogurt... which i call frogurt!
perhaps this will please the gentleman. take this object. but beware, it carries a terrible curse.
but it comes with a free frogurt.
the frogurt is also cursed.
but you get your choice of topping.
the toppings contain potassium benzoate. that's bad.
...and in environmental news, scientist have announced that springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly.
i'm krusty the clown and i'm going to kill you!
homer, what's wrong?
i'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to dad, but what pressure?
guess who, fat boy?
oh my god.
i love you, homer.
here ya' go buddy.
yeah, he buried me a couple a times.
so?
no.
and?
smithers, this is a golden opportunity. if we get him alive we can put him on broadway. dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the army!
dad, we did something very bad.
no.
yes.
uh huh.
homer, did you barricade the door?
it's our only hope.
dad, you killed the zombie flanders!
ow... careful... not the face.
i'm not a zombie. but hey, when in rome... wow, george washington.
shh! tv!
what are we going to have?
poison pizza.
that's the way we do it every year.
is it 37?
homer!
oh, all right.
ach.
mr. simpson... i just wanted to tell you that you've done a wonderful job with lisa. you must have read to her at a young age.
uh... we'd like the desk back mr. simpson.
just do it.
homer, we have a problem here.
we're talking about bart.
well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in.
you already put me in a home.
i'll be good. look what your bad egg of a son did to my teeth!
now this is exactly what bart's teacher was talking about. our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
please, homer. why do i always have to be the bad guy?
there must be something to eat around here. gee, maybe they mean it this time. from now on i guess i'd better straighten up and fly...
i promise.
wow.
indeed i did.
ayy, el estomago!
jin-gle bells, jin-gle bells...
i'unno.
well, you could punish me, but...
uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
why are you letting him do this?
well punish him!
how could you let this happen?
i wasn't here!
homer, do you want your son to become chief justice of the supreme court or a sleazy male stripper?
earl warren wasn't a stripper.
look, you have to help discipline your son.
during the war itchy & scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe. we'll be back with a real life itchy & scratchy. a rabid mouse in boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
come on, homer. this isn't funny.
dad, you gotta let me see that movie. can't you just give me a spanking? come on, go nuts.
dad, i agree that bart should be punished, but the itchy and scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. how would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?
that's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind.
i regret nothing!
not bloody likely.
dad, what's the point of this story?
look, can i please go to the movie?
tv sucks.
homer, we'd like to talk to you.
dad, you've got to let bart see that movie. i've never seen him like this. he has the demented melancholia of a tennessee williams heroine.
well, it's been two months. you laid down the law and i'm proud of you. but i think we've gotten through to him.
well, dad, i guess you won.
well, i'll be. the itchy and scratchy movie. come on. what d'ya say?
one senior citizen and one chief justice of the supreme court.
one soylent green. hold the butter.
itchy.
resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of "lemon time"...
homer, that's dish washing liquid!
oooh! they're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
howdy-do, neighbor! good pipe weather. thought i'd fire up the briar.
did you notice how slanted he looked?
haw haw!
hello, i'm troy mcclure. you might remember me from such instructional videos as "mothballing your battleship" and "dig your own grave - and save!" now over the next six hours i'll be taking you through the do's and do not do's of foundation repair. ready?
first, patch the cracks in the slab using a latex patching compound and a patching trowel...
now, do you have extruded polyvinyl foam insulation?
good. assemble the aluminum j-channel using self-furring screws. install.
after applying brushable coating to the panels...
....you'll need some corrosion-resistant metal stucco lath.
if you can't find metal stucco lath....
now, parge the lath...
i'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking. i figure it's gonna cost you... oh, eighty-five hundred.
behold the horrors of the slanty shanty. see the twisted creatures that dwell within. meet "cue ball," the man with no hair!
we have to do something...
i could get a job.
tonight, we've all come to honor a close friend of ours...
a man who provided the burns corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, mr. jack marley.
maybe i should apply for that job.
where does the bible say "racket?"....
chauffeur... seamstress... curator of large mammals?
we need the money, and my life is pretty boring. last week some jehovah's witnesses came to the door and i wouldn't let them leave. they snuck away when i went in the kitchen to get more lemonade.
i think it's wonderful. mom and dad side by side at the power plant. you'll be just like marie and pierre curie.
i'll just be a minute. i have to finish this paperwork.
but, where does it go?
it's working! it's working! and the healthy snacks are on their way.
springtime fresh, winter white... what could be better?
homie, what's wrong?
well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder.
oh really? i came to see you three times today. twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
you know the problem here was water leakage. if you just buy a fifty cent washer --
well, i guess that's it. people like us can't afford justice. come on homie, let's go before he fires you too.
you love her, too.
homer, i want you to show this woman the time of her life.
huh, huh, but, i'm going to have to go with shasta 'cause she liked makin' bacon on the beach.
mr. simpson, my husband and i have decided to move...
yes, well, there's a few things you could do to help us sell our home. first, whenever you walk in front of your window could you please wear pants?
second, could you please take in your jack-o-lanterns from past halloweens.
and please cover your garbage. it's attracting wildlife.
that medicine's not for you.
set sail for "the fryin' dutchman."
but i think i'm allergic to seafood. the last time i ate shrimp, my throat closed up and i went into convulsions.
i guess i should explain. laura's father and i divorced two years ago. oh, they're so sweet when you marry them, but soon it's just career, career, career.
daad!
i'll send laura over to baby-sit as soon as she gets home.
my divorce.
well i know what you're thinking and the answer is yes, i want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it. after all, homer, i do have the normal appetites.
i'm not.
right.
excellent choice... and for the gentleman?
'tis no man. 'tis a remorseless eating machine. arrrr... six bells, time for closin'.
fairly warned be thee, says i.
oh, please don't. for me?
don quixote?
don quixote.
i really think that was the character's name... don quixote!
well, who was it?
it's not working!
mr. simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film "the neverending story."
homer, i don't use the word "hero" very often. but you are the greatest hero in american history.
dad, i have some questions about women.
homer, bart's at a very curious age. as his father, i think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know.
are you sure...?
dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?
good luck in your trumped-up law suit, dad.
it was a moonless night, dark as pitch, when out of the mist came a beast more stomach than man.
uh, there's a pizza here for...
hi, homie. it's really starting to snow. i think you should come home.
you're dead weight, marty.
now, before i give you the check, one more question: uh, this place "moe's" you left just before the accident: this is a business of some kind?
she'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene.
oh. i guess you're only familiar with the new "batman" movies. michelle pfeiffer... ha! the only true "catwoman" is julie newmar, lee merriwether or eartha kitt. and i didn't need molded plastic to improve my physique. pure west. and how come batman doesn't dance anymore? remember the batusi?
homer, i've got to sneak these viable artworks out of the white house. but i can't get out of my driveway because of those protesters.
pally, this doesn't cost money, it makes money! you make the payments by plowing driveways on the side.
your wife?
i can't believe you bought that plow. we can't afford it.
good.
oh, homie, didn't that hurt?
and now, to read from the epistles of st. paul, homer simpson.
homer, this is really low.
arr! ninety sea chanteys on three compact discs. blow the man down maties / blow the man down... row, row, row your boat / in the navy come on and join your fellow man... act now and get a bonus cd: "hornpipe fever." arrgh.
dad, who's watching tv at 3:17 a.m.?
look! there we are!
that's right! i fill your driveways with ice and snow! what are you gonna do about it? nuthin', that's what.
mr. plow!
all right... i'm goin'... my head hurts. i have to lie down for a while.
uh-huh.
but i'm a real tightwad. can i afford this remarkable system?
you are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you mr. plow?
i wish i was a hero.
here i come world!
i was wrong about you buying that truck. i'm very proud of you, mr. plow. . this might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind...
no. no. could you wear the mr. plow jacket. just uh... for fun.
hi ya, homer! say hello to the plow king!
so you better make that call to the plow king. 
thank you, plow king-a-lee-ding.
ah, homer, why don't you plow it again?
hello, i'm calling from delinquent accounts at kumatsu motors --
i think you should do a new ad. one that's fresh and original.
promise you'll never do that again.
dad, was that your commercial?
the torch has been passed to a new generation of, uh, snow plow people... come on, give me the key. these look like teeth marks.
that's great arnie.
i don't know. i'd be up there all day... i wouldn't be able to plow any other driveways...
oh yeah? which president's on it?
well, i guess you can plow my driveway. but i wonder what happened to the plow king.
oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt?
homie, please don't go.
ah, dying's not so bad. i'll be reunited with my loved ones. my dad... and that plant i never watered.
homer, you saved my life and i'm not gonna forget it. from now on, we'll be partners.
hello, this is the repo depot. i'm just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow.
ohh, now homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something.
he does not.
well, don't push her. remember, "tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt."
tell it, mom. tell, it mom.
i miss-a da klinger already.
homer!
homer.
homer.
da... da... da...
domer.
hi yo!
got your wallet.
guess what, homie... there's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now.
no.
we're going to have another baby.
i'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
won't that warp him?
you don't have a cousin frank.
once you get used to the smell of melted hog fat, you'll wonder how you ever did without it.
we were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect... just imagine what we can do with this place.
well, here's what they're asking.
why'd you come to me. i don't know nothing. i used to get by on my looks. now they're gone -- withered away like an old piece of fruit.
no, not yet. i was voted the handsomest boy in albany, new york.
oh! well, all i own is this house, that i built with my own two hands.
i ratted on everybody and got off scot free! all right, son. i'll sell this dump and write you a check.
so, how long before you shipped grampa off to the old folks home?
mommy.
when are we going to get to my first word?
my first word.
daaad!
mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole.
hey, homer. this house sucks.
you'll be history! buenos dias, neighboritos. the handle's flanders, but my friends call me ned.
if you need anything, just give a whistle.
well, gee, i...
i just this minute bought it at the hardware st...
sure, you can borrow it for a little while.
bart, get out!
krusty funny.
crib! crib! i'm a baby!
oh, doctor! we are seconds away from the 100-meter butterfly, and with the east german "women" shaving their backs 9,000 miles away. ... the americans are heavy favorites.
homie... i think the baby's coming.
coming up next, an hour-long episode of mama's family.
we'll take good care of your boy, simpson. enjoy the miracle of creation.
according to this magazine, bart might be jealous of her.
where's the beef? what the hell's that supposed to mean?
you people are pigs! i personally am gonna spit in every 50th burger.
ouch! but first, let's go to the boxing venue.
davah hassahoff.
i'm sorry, bart, you're too little.
homer!
heidy-ho, simpson. your son shoved this through our doggie door. and since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my tv tr...
wow! lisa, can you say "mommy"?
did too.
honey, you really shouldn't eat so much in bed. it's not good for your heart.
homie, what is it?
daaad!
homer, i prepared a special surprise just for you.
here you go.
nice healthy oatmeal.
no there isn't.
dad, there's a bug on that.
it's your heart. and i think it's on its last thump.
but wait, perhaps i'm being too hasty. you are highly skilled... at goofing off! now don't worry, homer. you're the kind of guy i could really dig. a grave for. your indolence is inefficacious!
clear!
oh, homie, i was so frightened.
what a voice. young homer is going to make me a millionaire.
mr. simpson, i'm afraid you've just had a mild heart attack.
oh no, quite the opposite. it's made you weak as a kitten. look!
coochy coochy coo!
oh, you swing like a girl. come on, now.
got your nose.
how 'bout this little bee?
well, we can't fix his heart, but we can tell you exactly how damaged it is.
good lord.
now homer, this is a new body fat analysis test. i start you jiggling, and measure how long it takes to stop.
homer, i'm afraid you'll have to undergo a coronary by-pass operation.
you're going to need open heart surgery!
we're going to cut you open and tinker with your ticker.
seventy dollars.
no. don't you have health insurance at work?
now before we give you health insurance, i have to ask you a few questions.
oh good. now, under "heart attacks" you crossed out "3" and wrote "0".
uh huh. and uh, do you drink?
all right. here's your policy.
oh, hold on there, you still have to sign it.
sir, i'm sorry, we can't insure you.
no, that doesn't count.
we'd better get you to a hospital.
mr. simpson, you must get that operation as soon as possible.
honey, did you have any luck?
what is it, dad?
hi everybody. are you looking for a way to slash the cost of your medical expenses?
okay, friend. you tried the best, now try the rest. call 1-600-doctorb. the "b" is for bargain!
how?
operation? what are you talking about?
we feel neither highs nor lows.
eh.
dad, are you trying to tell us you're getting a coronary-artery bypass graft?
oh, no. what if they botch it? i won't have a dad... for a while.
what about abraham lincoln?
homer!
homer simpson! well, if that don't put the "dink" in co-inky-dink.
i'm having a kidney and a lung removed.
first come, first served! what are you in for?
if i could give you my heart, homer, i would.
ah, you know, homer, that beer ain't free.
shhh.
well, if he's been good, he'll go to heaven. in heaven, you get to do whatever you like best, all the time.
hey hey! hey, what's the matter? oh, that's right. my grotesque appearance.
oh, it's part of my public service for my glug, glug, vroom, vroom, thump thump.
well, there's nothing funny about what you're about to go through. i know, i'm in the zipper club myself.
we passed this card around at work.
when i first heard about the operation, i was against it. but then i thought, if homer wants to be a woman, so be it.
uh, homer, i snuck you in a beer for old time's sake.
oh homie, i could never remarry...
ohhh... kids, you can come in now.
thanks dad.
well, i think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of.
ordah! please rise for the a pledge of allegiance.
excuse me, we could use the money to hire firemen to finally put out that blaze on the east side of town.
well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition main street is in. many of us have destroyed it by leaving winter chains on our tires and carrying too much weight.
you know, a town with money's a little like the mule with a spinning wheel. no one knows how he got it and danged if he knows how to use it!
monorail / monorail / monorail!
i still think we should have spent the money to fix main street.
are you stuck in a dead-end job?
are you squandering the precious gift of life in front of the idiot box?
are you on your third beer of the evening?
actual institute may not match photo.
homer, no...
your life-long dream was to run out on the field during a baseball game, and you did it last year, remember?
true or false: you can get mono from riding the monorail?
no, you were right, it's "false." wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!
you know, i used to think you were stuck in an emasculating, go-nowhere job.
but now, i want to follow in your footsteps.
according to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. what if something goes wrong?
it frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
no.
goodnight, homer.
oh, right, that. well, i've been monitoring your progress closely... but this gentleman here clearly stands out above the rest.
yeah, sure.
homer, there's a family of opossums in here!
is there a chance the track could bend?
is there a chance the track could bend.
can't you stop it, dad?
does anyone wanna switch seats?
homer? homer?
homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you.
no, he's a scientist.
dad, you're a hero!
and "the washing machine"!
see the happiest fish in the world at our fabulous beerquarium!
yayyy!
we're under six!
no use complaining about something you can't change.
oh homer, quit pouting.
if you don't mind! we're on our way to a funeral.
which old witch?
hey homer, this luggage is crushing me.
yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!
homer, that's very rude of you.
another placemat, sir?
eh.
homer!
to marge, i leave my collection of potato chips that resemble celebrities. they're all here. otto von bismarck. maurice chevalier. right up to jay leno. these chips were my children, marjorie. take special care of them.
can we go to duff gardens this weekend?
aunt selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?
have you been eating that sandwich again?
geez, we hardly made a dent in that ten-foot hoagie.
you've been eating that thing for a week. i think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
homer, i found this behind the radiator. i really think you should throw it away.
are you going to eat it?
you look terrible.
your lips are turning blue. i think you'd better stay home.
goodbye dad! don't eat any solids.
yayyy!
do you feel any better?
well, to cheer you up i rented a couple of videos. "boxing's greatest weigh-ins" and "yentl".
it deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter rabbinical school.
what's going on here? oh, yentl. i might have known.
hmmm, well, you've cooled down.
you know, i rented another tape... in case you felt better.
with norman fell as zeus!
i can't. the beans'll burn.
how do you do it, homer?
homer, we're going to my sisters'! remember, pick up bart!
after sixteen glorious seasons, the green bay faithful bid farewell to bryan bartlett starr.
hey homie, i can see your doodle!
he called you a bad father.
no, i just think you should talk to bart about-- good lord! homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?
no, no. someone made three hundred dollars worth of phone calls to something called "the corey hotline."
i did. dad, can i...
nah, his game was blackjack. he bet our life savings on a single hand.
twenty.
twenty-one.
father-son picnic.
bart, i could kiss you, if the bigger brothers hadn't made me sign a form promising i wouldn't. no one needs me more than a child with your tragic upbringing. now, let's set down at that frogurt stand.
playing with milhouse.
dad, it just kinda happened. you're taking this too hard.
and what are your reasons for wanting a little brother?
any of these boys would be thrilled to have a bigger brother like you.
do you have a bigger brother for me yet? okay. i'll be back in an hour.
just like oscar the grouch.
poppa homer!
your son bart sounds very bad.
shaddap!
why does it stop there?
tell me more! i want to know all the constellations!
oh, poppa homer, you are so learned.
i love you, poppa homer.
pepi.
hey, homer, have you seen my skateboard?
who the hell is pepi?
who needs you? tom's a better father than you ever were.
i was faking it.
oh yeah? remember this? "higher, dad, higher!... whee, whee... push harder, dad!..."
is that true?
come on, bart. you know better than to talk to strangers.
his father? the drunk and gambler?
there you go, fellas. 
uh... homer?
another beer, dad?
dad, remember when tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, "i'm a hemophiliac" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back?
will you teach me how to do that?
yeah.
yeah.
and this is for my huggy bug in honor of this special day.
ah, thank you, dear.
i'll bet you have a lot of things planned, eh dad?
hey, dad. why don't you give mom her present?
one hundred dollars.
ohh, i think you will.
la da de / la da da... la da dum da de da da dum da dum da de
nickel off on expired baby food.
oh, i'd give anything to go to that show!
hey!
ralph thinks i like him. but i only gave him a valentine 'cause i felt sorry for him.
well, honey, i--
i get the idea.
thanks, mom.
forget it. to get those tickets our parents would have to be part of springfield's cultural elite.
oh no, it's ralph! just make some excuse.
yes, sir. i'd do anything for lisa.
mr. simpson, the tar fumes are making me dizzy.
dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?
well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me.
homer, that's a terrible thing to say.
yeah. you got a tail-light out.
right there.
hasta la vista, abie.
and now, our evening comes to an end...
homer, i want you to encourage lisa with her science fair project.
yes please!
bart, don't give the dog cigarettes!
i'd also like to express my fondness for that particular beer.
... and here we have duff, duff lite, and our newest flavor, duff dry. what does the future hold for duff? let's just say we've got a few ideas up our sleeve.
um, i'd rather not get into it right now.
all right, we don't have any ideas for the future. we got nothing. happy?
hey, thanks a lot. that makes it all worthwhile.
are you crazy? we still haven't tried raspberry duff, lady duff, tartar control duff...
i'm fine.
ow. what was that for?
look alive, boys. coupla stewed prunes headed your way.
your license is hereby revoked and you are to attend traffic school and two months of alch-anon meetings.
haw haw!
what a terrible waste. hi! i'm actor, troy mcclure. you might remember me from such driver's ed films as "alice's adventures through the windshield glass" and "the decapitation of larry leadfoot." for the next 60 minutes we'll be seeing actual film of car crash victims.
my name is hans. drinking has ruined my life. i'm thirty-one years old.
homie, do you ever drink alone?
no.
do you need a beer to fall asleep?
do you ever hide beer around the house?
homie, i'd like you to do something for me.
i want you to give up beer for a month.
did you say beer or deer?
please, homie, i know you can do this.
what was that noise?
cupcakes, cupcakes. yes, sweet cakes for all.
dang, i was aiming for his head.
you thinking what i'm thinking?
the windup and the two two pitch... oh no! the batter is calling for time... looks like he's going and getting himself a new bat. and now there's a beachball on the field. and the ballboys are discussing which one of them is gonna go get it.
uh huh. this is the 128 ounce tub. you can fit your whole head in it. don't be scared jubjub. it's mama.
so homer, please feel free to tell us anything. there's no judgment here.
chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug.
i'm proud of you, homie.
you don't have to start drinking right away. i was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
but you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look. you've saved more than a hundred dollars. i found it in your pants.
ow.
that is one evil dude.
now stay tuned for professional wrestling, live from the springfield grapplarium! tonight, a texas death match... dr. hillbilly vs. the iron yuppie. one man will actually be unmasked and killed in the ring!
homer, lisa needs braces.
soon!
bullseye!
lisa needs braces.
hey!
i wouldn't have old chomper here, that's for sure.
congratulations, homer!
... unless you're crooked.
this is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
don homer, i have baked a special donut just for you.
don homer, my son, he has trouble with the...
do you think you can get the dental plan back?
dad, i'll trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol' danish.
hmm, he's a worthy foe. look at him, smithers. exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine.
we don't have to be adversaries, homer. we both want a fair union contract. and, if you scratch my back, i'll scratch yours. i mean, if i should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm? after all, negotiations make strange bedfellows.
honey, you look fine.
goons.
hired goons.
ah, homer! i hope crusher and low blow didn't hurt you.
oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. i prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons.
ohh, shut up. and this is my basement.
yes, i really should stop ending the tour with it. now, let's get down to business. now, homer, i know what you're thinking and i want to take the pressure off. it doesn't take a whiz to see that you're looking out for number one. well, listen to me and you'll make a big splash very soon.
oh. it's the twenty-third door on the left.
find the bathroom alright?
well, you've won this round simpson, but i'll grind you into the earth like a bug! simpson, be a dear and rub my legs till the feeling comes back. a bug, i tell you! a bug!
because they love you down at the plant.
that doesn't sound like they like you at all.
nay.
yes, well, my director is telling me not to talk to you anymore.
so we'll march day and night /
look at them all, through the darkness i'm bringing. they're not sad at all, they're actually singing! they sing without juicers! they sing without blenders! they sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! tell simpson i'm ready to deal all right! you can even have the dental plan!... on one condition. you must resign as head of the union.
smithers, i'm beginning to think that homer simpson was not the brilliant tactician i thought he was.
oh no, i can't see! i'm blind! blind!
you're goin' down, homer! i'm gonna fool you!
i'll fool you up real nice!
p.u.
like halloween and christmas, april fool's day traces its origins to pagan ritual.
the christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
dad! i was telling the story.
i've got to fool him before the day is out -- but how? he must have a weakness.
beer! beer is the cheese. but how to use it...
ay, no es bueno.
the following is a public service announcement. excess of alcohol consumption can cause liver damage, and cancer of the rectum.
homie!
...you are wired in to the rest of your family. you have the ability to shock them, and they have the ability to shock--
arrrgh!
i won't jump anymore, i promise.
i love you, dad.
right, dad.
it was an amusing episode... of our lives.
i brought you a little present.
hey, what'll i tell the boss?
you can do it, homer. stand up.
he just won't budge. i've tried everything. nothing can reach him.
hi, dr. nick!
please, do go on...
oh, please, continue...
hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?
why?
homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?
dad, it's all my fault! i shook up that can of beer! it was just an april fool's joke.
you lost five percent of your brain.
it's so sad that krusty is ashamed of his roots.
"third notice," "final notice," "some guys are coming."... ooh, what's this? an invitation to our high school reunion. gee, that's odd. they didn't send one to you.
oh my god.
well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. wait, maybe it does.
and you're a nuclear technician?
what did you way?
time to go to the reunion.
that was "happy days."
oh, it's you simpson.
i am not a crook.
hello, marge. have you heard? i'm stinking rich. jealous?
i would.
homer? homer?
okay, very good. now, let's get on with our rilly big shew...
... first, the award for the alumnus who's gained the most weight... homer simpson!
how'd you do it, homer?
and now, the award for most improved odor... homer simpson!
and the person who traveled the least distance to be here... well, kiss my grits... homer simpson!
it fell in the toilet.
dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect.
hello, son! i was on my way home from work and thought i'd drop by.
they pay me eight hundred dollars a week to tell a cat and a mouse what to do.
dad, can we talk to grampa alone for a minute?
welcome to remedial science 1a. my uh wife recently passed away... i thought teaching might ease my loneliness.
now, i'm going to uh burn this donut to show you how many calories it has.
the bright blue flame indicates this was a particularly sweet donut.
all right, here are your exams. fifty questions, true or false.
homer, i was just describing the test.
look, homer, just take the test and you'll do fine.
that's wonderful, homie!
hens love roosters/ geese love ganders/ everyone else loves ned flanders
it's all so barbaric.
i got expelled.
look, dad. i don't need school. i'll make my way as a bootblack. shine yer boots guv'nor?
you're going to get an education. i'm going to teach you myself.
whacking day is coming.
but killing snakes is evil.
excuse me.
dad? dad, everyone likes whacking day, but i hate it. is there something wrong with me?
then, what should i do?
yeah.
yeah.
slow... then fast.
dad please, for the last time, i beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob.
that's right. order now and you'll also get sun `n' run, the suntan lotion... that's also a laxative!
hey, dad. this came for you in the mail.
smithers, this plague doesn't scare me. i've constructed a germ-free chamber for myself. not a single microbe can get in or out. who the devil are you?
there is no such thing.
... flintstones' chewable morphine.
... flintstones' chewable morphine.
morphine
morphine
no offense, but we're putting that bitch on ice.
no. in fact i can recite pi to 40,000 places. the last digit is one!
i'll be fine, dear.
well... once. homer, i don't think this fish is quite dead yet.
who's gonna change maggie?
it seems like i've been wearing the same red dress forever.
oh honey, i've missed you too. homer, is that an old halloween costume?
i'll bet you want a piece of me. well, you ain't gonna get it, see! ha, ha, ha... doggone it.
did you see that?
what's gabbo?
i don't think they're giving you enough information, dad.
i can't believe it. our first glimpse of gabbo!
dad...
what?... what am i lookin' at? i don't see nothin'. i'm gonna stop looking soon... what... what, is that it?
sure, but it'll cost ya.
uh-oh.
you've got to keep working on it.
it is, it really really is.
dad, when did you record an album?
dad, thanks to television, i can't remember what happened eight minutes ago. no, really, i can't. it's a serious problem. what are we all laughing about?
hello...
hello, ma baby / hello, ma honey / hello, ma ragtime, ragtime gal / send me a kiss by wire... etc.
barbershop! that ain't been popular since aught six, dagnabit!
goodbye...
homer, i'm a theatrical agent, and i want to represent your group.
yeah! you've got... it! all except that police officer. too village people. you'll have to replace him.
where are we going? where are we going?

gentlemen, you've just recorded your first number one.
oh yes, bouffant betty. well i would prefer we kept your marriage a secret. you see, a lot of women are going to want to have sex with you, and we want them to think they can.
homer, you're going to be famous!
have you seen bart?
damned ceremonies. this is time i could be working, mommy.
this enormous woman will devour us all!
hello, homer. i'm george harrison.

for all the latest medical poop / call surgeon general, c. everett koop / koop koop adoop this is worse than your song about mr. t.
gentlemen, us magazine just came out with its "what's hot and what's not issue."
we are not.
ah that's great. your replacement was getting tired. hey, queenie, you can go now.
since when could you write a song?
... it's a trip to paradise / with my ba-by... on board!
bart, what's wrong with you?
hmm. this one's done in different handwriting.
but who'd want to hurt me? i'm this century's "dennis the menace."
that man is so rude.
oh i'll stay away from your son, all right. stay away, forever.
now sideshow bob can't get in without me knowing. and once a man is in your home, anything you do to him is nice and legal.
hiedilly-hey!
... homer simpson, marge simpson, lisa simpson, that little baby simpson. that is all.
don't worry, mrs. simpson, we've helped hundreds of people in danger. we'll give you a new name, a new job, new identities.
elway takes the snap and runs it in for a touchdown! thanks to elway's patented last-second magic, the final score of super bowl 30: denver - 7; san francisco - 56!

i'll be gus, the lovable chimney sweep. clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all westminster. yeah!
we have places your family can hide in peace and security: cape fear, terror lake, new horrorfield, screamville...
tell you what sir, from now on you'll be homer thompson at terror lake. let's just practice a bit. when i say "hello, mr. thompson," you'll say, "hi."
hello, mr. thompson. remember now, your name is homer thompson.
hello, mr. thompson. now when i say, "hello, mr. thompson" and press down on your foot... you smile and nod.
hello, mr. thompson.
hey look! "the fbi light opera society sings the complete gilbert and sullivan." three little maids from school are we / pert as a schoolgirl well can be / filled to the brim with girlish glee / three little maids from school...
homer, where's the dog?
we've left it all behind. how can you make a clean break with your life?
mom! dad! i saw sideshow bob and he threatened to kill me!
homer, this is serious.
dad, i'm kinda edgy right now. i'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife.
i knew i had to buy some time. so, i asked him to sing the score from "the hms pinafore."
duh, homer, why are we down here?
but why?
yes, he's in geneva, chairing a conference on nuclear fission. yes, that should stick.
homer, this is an exact replica of your workstation. now, we're going to simulate a power surge in core sector eight.
relax, it's just a simulator. nothing can go wrong.
i like to put my feet up.
yes. he would.
college? barber or clown?
i think this is a great opportunity. you could learn so much.
homer, sign this application and you're a shoe-in.
dad, don't let these application essays throw you. let's see... "list your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."
no.
no.
no.
you the man, homer.
i dunno, dad. don't you have a better picture?
ah... steakey.
oh, don't worry, i've expelled those rowdy members of chug-a-lug house.
g-rrrrr!
well, pop, what are you gonna do?
you don't know, do you?
hey!
three days.
homer, that isn't very nice.
hi there, hello, i'm dean peterson, but you can call me bobby. i just want you to know if you ever feel stressed out from studying or whatever, i'm always up for some hackey sack. or hey, if you just want to come by and jam, i used to be the bass player for "the pretenders."
now, we'll begin by - oops...
now, if anyone would like to stay, i'm going to hold a comprehensive review session after every class.
no.
homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase.
this proton accelerator de-stabilizes the atom in this chamber here, then propels it...
well please, come down and show us.
homer, no one blames you for the accident. we simply feel you might benefit with a little outside tutoring. i researched these names myself...
hello?
stop the humanoid!
and the words to every monty python routine... we are the knights who say nee! nee! nee! nee!
listen to yourself, man. you're hangin' with nerds.
homer, please. these boys sound very nice, but they're clearly nerds.
dad, nerds are nothing to fear. in fact they've done some pretty memorable things. some nerds of note include; popcorn magnate, orville redenbacher, rock star, david byrne and supreme court justice david souter.
come on, mr. simpson, you'll never pass this course if you don't know the periodic table.
ho. including all known lanthanides and actinides? good luck!
if you're going for a ride i'd like you to take bart and lisa.
so it's a prank you're lookin' for, is it? i'll give you your prank... the only other college in fifty miles is springfield a&m, so they're our best target.
meet sir oinks-a-lot, the beloved mascot of springfield a&m. here he is presiding over last year's homecoming. here he is conferring an honorary degree on richard nixon. and here he is rolling in his own filth. gentlemen, i propose we kidnap sir oinks-a-lot...
mr. simpson, i don't think he likes that.
huh, i can't believe that worked.
it's bad enough they put their retainers in the dishwasher -- can't we do something?
you really think you can get us back into college?
why does it have to be zany?
prank?
well, i'm touched by your honesty. and who knows, perhaps i've been a bit of an ogre myself.
we really want to thank you, mr. simpson.
so, in conclusion, good luck on tomorrow's big final exam.
what are you gonna do mr. simpson?
or, with our help you could cram like you've never crammed before.
aw, man, i can't believe you failed.
mr. simpson, there is a way. we could... well, use a computer to change your grade.
oh yes. the only problem is the moral dilemma it raises... which requires...
an "a plus"! how did you do it?
way to go, dad!
no we didn't.
no you didn't. you only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong.
and i learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating.
par-ty down?
what? homie!
what's wrong?
where is that dreaded piñata?
what are you doin'?
actually, mom, a tweaking of mr. burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn dad a special place in the old man's heart.
does either of you know what incontinent means?
come on dear. it's time to go.
homer! you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss.
i have some sad news to report. a small puppy, not unlike lassie was just run over in the parking lot. and now it's time for the comedy stylings of homer simpson!
oh... that poor dog.
quiet, you awful man!
what!
how dare you!
destroy him.
yes'm. dad, i know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.
the burns bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. it could be in your house. you could be looking at it right now. it could be right in front of your face as i'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.
bobo. it's mr. burns' bear all right.
no. let's send burns the eye in the mail. he'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
bobo! my beautiful bobo! i promise i'll never leave you behind again. ah, yes. naturally i can't pay you much of a reward because... i'm strapped for cash. as you can see, this old place is falling apart. but i'm sure we can come to an understanding.
may i offer you a drink?
how much do you want?
done. now, give me that bear.
you've made a mistake, simpson.
yes.
have you been up all night eating cheese?
excuse me wanted to see the guy who valued the happiness of his children over money.
aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.
homer simpson, report for much worse duties.
i think we need a new hairdryer.
i don't hate you, i'm proud of you. you came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.
two plus two is four / two plus two is four.... / two plus two is four....
what's that you say? you can live without television as long as you have beer?
homer, give him what he wants.
is it my imagination or is tv getting worse?
please... please.
eh, don't worry, i'm sure i'll remember it.
and next in our fall catalogue: we love this, it is a vision in raspberry cream.
well, that can be arranged.
it's always the one you least suspect! now many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting upon the grave ramifica...
now remember: the instant you finish it, i own your soul for --
technically no, but --
you are not smarter than me! i'll see you in hell yet, homer simpson!
homer?! did you eat that donut?
so, you like donuts, eh?
well! have all the donuts in the world!!
homer! are you all right?
no.
homer, stop picking at it.
lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. don't worry, honey, the scary part's over.
we come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. to even gaze upon it is to go mad.
no, no, they're wrong! the creature they seek is the walking undead. nosferatu! das wampyre! a vampire!
oh, i'm very excited about this deal... oh... precious blood.
lisa, stop being so suspicious. did everyone wash their necks like mr. burns asked?
dad, do you notice anything strange?
i heard that!
eww, dad, this is blood.
hello, mother. hello, father. i missed you during my uneventful absence.
lisa, it's not like you have a choice here.
the only way to get bart back is to kill the head vampire, mr. burns.
this is dangerous. i wish we could have found a sitter for maggie.
no, dad.
you must drive this stake right through his heart.
uh, dad, that's his crotch.
but, no, we killed mr. burns.
maybe it's the tv.
what the hell...? oooh, we got a call.
i'd like to pledge thirty dollars. oh, thank you!
they need our support. besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet.
you like ballet?
that's one right there.
mr. simpson, you do realize this may result in hair loss, giddiness, and the loss of equilibrium?
hey, homer, you wanna get a beer on the way home?
gonna go see the bear in the little car, huh?
hey careful there, homer. i heard somebody lost an arm in there once.
let's get outta here!
homer, this is never easy to say. i'm gonna have to saw your arms off.
homer, are you just holding onto the can?
"mrs. simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."
i'm disappointed in you, but it turns out i had a wonderful time with ruth powers. in fact, we're going out again tomorrow night.
heh, heh. oh marge, we should do this every thursday.
what's so special about it?
i don't know.
i'm not sure.
you already asked me that.
don't wait up.
rock the casbah!
sure dad.
hey, dad, i think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter.
you're absolutely right, homer. we don't need a baby-sitter.
blast that infernal card! don't give that card to me.
mr. simpson. i was just going through your garbage and i couldn't help overhearing that you need a baby-sitter. of course being a highly skilled attorney, my fee is one hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour.
three.
okay, two. and i get to keep this old bird cage.
beautiful, huh? homer and i used to come up here on dates. homer, stop that! it's just a weather station.
ahhh. there's nothing like moonshine from your own still. oh, simpson! what are you doing here?
we're in pursuit of two female suspects. one is wearing a green dress, pearls and has a lot of blue hair.
that's exactly how dillinger got started.
mmmm, engine block eggs. if we can keep these down, we'll be sittin' pretty.
oh no, they're headed right for the grand chasm.
homer?!
you're right. i am lucky to have him.
ha! and to think those idiot environmentalists were protesting this landfill.
lionel hutz, aka miguel sanchez, aka doctor nguyen van thoc, was paid eight dollars for his thirty-two hours of baby-sitting. he was glad to get it. marge simpson was charged with a violation of penal code section 618a, wanton destruction of precious antique cans. she was ordered to pay fifty cents to replace the cans, and $2,000 in punitive damages and mental anguish. homer simpson was remanded to the custody of the united states army neuro-chemical research center at fort meade maryland for extensive testing.
stop that, bart. homer, speak to him.
why do you read that "free" column, homer? they never have anything good.
what is it?
hey! that seltzer ain't free.
that's me. you here for the trampoline?
well, i used to do a lot of tumbling in my act, but i'm phasing it out for more dirty limericks. there once was a man named enos --
you're a good dog, arencha, boy? arencha?
i don't know if this is a good idea.
are you sure it's safe?
it smells funny in there.
stop jumping on me! i'm hurt!
homer, this is terrible!
i told you this was a bad idea!
dad. dad! you really want to get rid of this trampoline?
let's jump on the car instead.
that's not true.
i can name ten things! i... i made sloppy joes...
um... uh, well... uh...
i'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
that video really opened my eyes. i can see that i'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. by nagging you when you do foolish things, i just enable your life-script.
uh-oh. you're in for it now, dad.
i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
i'm feeling annoyance and frustration, but also tolerance.
good. i'm glad we had this talk.
brad goodman is coming to town!
we know, dad.
food goes in here.
that means no, eh? i'm not so old-fashioned. your parents have done a fantastic job. mama, papa -- could you come up here?
arr! this picture'll serve me well on those lonely nights at sea.
i didn't feel like it.
eep.
they're headin' for the old mill!
no! self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. it's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery.
you tell me, chief. you had a pretty good view from behind your desk.
what does that mean, exactly?
dad, sit down.
homer, i have to go out to pick up something for dinner.
money's too tight for steak.
sure, steak.
it's a hell-of-a--- towwwnnn!!
i know you think the junior campers are square and... "uncool," but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies.
don't do what donny don't does. they could've made this clearer. they won't let you have any fun.
homer, you should be more supportive.
homer!
oh, no. me bring homer on a rafting trip?
actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip.
dad, i really want you to come on this trip with me!
arrr, here be a fine vessel. the yarest river-goin' boat there be.
okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. two dads to a raft.
now what happened to that gosh darn map i brought?
whoa, nelly! oh, quick, homer! which way do we turn--?
paddle harder, homer. we gotta fight the current.
hey! i got that for my birthday!
again? homer, we have to ration the water carefully. it's our only hope.
homer! no!
wrong, we're saved! sea gulls always stay near land. they only go out to sea to die.
well, at least ned is trying! what are you doing to help?
stop it! / stop it! / dad!
a rescue plane! get the flare gun!
come back! come back! oh, we're done for! we're done for! we're done-diddily-done for we're done- diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily done-diddily-doodily...
dad, i think he's oka--
you know, homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food.
godspeed, li'l doodle.
a real swiss army knife. cool!
dad, i know i've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. if i had the strength to lift my arms, i'd give you a hug.
dad, don't take this wrong, but your expression doesn't fill me with confidence.
hey, wait! i smell hamburgers too.
that's what you're smelling, homer! oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!
close the damn thing down! no one's ever gonna come.
you did it, dad! you saved us! i'm proud you're my father.
and we can't take off our pants when it gets real hot.
yeah, ditto.
ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
have a good night, homer.
seems okay. anybody see the game last night?
yeah, usually you just take the box of donuts into the bathroom.
yeah.
hey, joey joe joe!
"your infatuation is based on a physical attraction. talk to the woman, and you'll realize you have nothing in common."
can't talk... eating.
double glaze.
not me. that's my idea of heaven.
really? i can see i'm gonna love working with you. well, gotta go. i wanna sneak in a quick nap before lunch.
i guess we'll be going down together. i mean getting off together. i mean...
think unsexy thoughts. think unsexy thoughts.
hi, hober. dote kiss be, i'b all stuffed up.
hi, dad.
dad, look, i made fish sticks. they're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out.
that raccoon stole my lamb chop.
oh that's sweet. guess what. there's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a t-shirt. i got two dollars off because mine got smeared.
homer simpson! that's a dilly of a pickle. hey, let's conference you with marge, huh?
homer, i'm your guardian angel. i've assumed the form of someone you would recognize and revere - sir isaac newton.
oh, very well.
i'm not actually col. klink. i'm just assuming his form.
i'm so happy, darling.
yes, sir. quite.
let's get out of here! sure, life is good for you, but what about marge?
dad, why are you singing?
are you hiding something from me?
judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named mindy... or a man named andy.
dad, i'm not gonna fall for that.
huh?
hi, homer.
come on, i'll get you the tickets.
what is it? do you have a question?
tv's there; bathroom's there; and there's your king sized bed for...
free shower curtain!
wow, if it weren't for this wall we'd be sleeping in the same bed.
homer, i got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.
no, homer. let's do it. let's call room service!
i can't believe we ordered so much.
no more chernobyls!
and now the moment you've been waiting for. this year's king and queen of energy are... homer simpson and mindy simmons!
homer, mindy, you've just won a romantic dinner alone, at madame chao's, the sexiest chinese restaurant in capital city!
what a perfect evening. it was sure nice of them to make us cheeseburgers.
okay.
this was a really nice night, homer.
what's wrong?
oh... well, we don't have to.
well, desserts aren't always right.
homer, you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
this was a wonderful idea, homie. hey, there's a turkey behind the bed.
dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you.
this could be a whole new beginning for springfield.
dad, what do you think?
why?
hey! i said bug off!
yee ha! homer, i want you to have my lucky hat. i wore it the day kennedy was shot, and it allllways brings me good luck!
hi, homie.
i was for the casino!
for you. it's the president.
definitely have to leave the table.
gotta watch wapner. leave the table. yeah, leave the table.
ewww!
i'll catch up to you.
i'll walk.
yeah.
go home. you're bad luck!
there's nothing to eat for breakfast.
maybe mom just doesn't realize we miss her. we could go down to the casino and let her know.
i won sixty dollars last night.
mommm!
i just had a bad dream.
well, i know it's absurd, but i dreamed the boogeyman was after me and he's hiding...
what happened here?
thanks, mom.
dad, mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the geography pageant is tonight.
but dad, if i don't show up in a rubber suit shaped like the state of florida, i'll be the laughing stock of the whole school.
dad!
i'm not a state, i'm a monster!
think before you say each word.
what?
lisa's costume. homer, i didn't realize. i'm so sorry.
you know, you're right, homer. maybe i should get some professional help.
that's true. will you forgive me?
homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that.
homer!
wake up, dad! wake up! there was a burglar and he took my saxophone.
and my necklace.
homer! that necklace was a priceless bouvier family heirloom.
bart's pain is funny, but mine isn't. that saxophone was my one creative outlet. it was the only way i could truly express myself.
homer, tell your child what you bought when i sent you to town to get some insurance.
oh, stop blaming the beans.
and don't take candy from strangers.
what's the point of all these precautions? i've already lost the only thing that matters to me.
what, this jug?
thank you.
hey, you're that drunken posse. wow, can i join you?
yeah! someone else! someone else! someone else!
he's right!
i'll join! i'm filled with piss and vinegar. at first i was just filled with vinegar...
and a fine job ye did too!
i don't think the guns are a good idea, homer.
oops.
so, wedding, huh?
radiant cool crazy nightmare. zen new jersey nowhere.
how now brown bureaucrats.
hey, see this sign?
meaning what exactly?
it's not just a megaphone, dad. it's a rapmaster 2000.
it's hammer!
sears.
i got one.
it makes me feel like a big man.
dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? i mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?
and i still don't have my saxophone.
world domination?
mr. simpson, how do you respond to the charge that petty vandalism such as graffiti is down 80 percent, while heavy sack beatings are up a shocking 900 percent?
i see. well, what do you say to the accusation that your group has been causing more crimes than it's been preventing?
hello, kent. hello, homer, my arch nemesis.
uh, you do realize who this is...
no, homer, i'm not your wife, although i do enjoy her pearls. as a matter of fact, i'm holding them right now. listen.
homer, that's our stage manager!
it may interest you to know that for my next crime i'll be pinching the pride and joy of the springfield museum, the world's largest cubic zirconia.
son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg.
any sign of the burglar yet?
how's that?
how's that?
i believe you, dad.
you let me down, man. now i don't believe in nothing no more. i'm going to law school.
dad, maybe this will cheer you up.
molloy said, 'i'll catch up with you.' i couldn't quite put my finger on it. there was something strange about the way he walked. much more vertical than usual. and finally, molloy, unlike most retired people, has the world's largest cubic zirconia on his coffee table.
what an eyesore.
homer old chum. well done. if anyone was going to catch me, i'm glad it was you.
i suppose you're wondering where i hid all the millions of dollars i stole over the years.
it's buried right here in springfield, under a big t.
big t, huh?
it's just a piece of paper.
uh, how're we gonna get outta here?
why are you so happy?
hi, homer.
i've got a weekend job helping the poor. and i'm only eight.
well...
hey, what's a-matter with you, you crazy kid? you a-chasin' away my a-business. hey, pepe, go for the face!
dad, i'm asking if i can get a job.
that's for taking credit for other people's work.
thanks dad, that's great advice.
but inside it's mostly about ross perot. and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial.
like what?
obnoxious fad?
i'm doing the conan o'brien show and i wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about.
dad, there's more to me than just a catchphrase.
watch the conan o'brien show. you'll see.
if anyone wants me i'll be in my room.
silly customer! you cannot hurt a twinkie! jiminy cricket, whew, expired ham! well, this time i've gone too far. no, no one will fall for...
i'm so sorry. please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.
okay, ten pounds.
good evening. here's an update on last week's nursing home expose: "geezers in freezers." it turns out the rest home was adequately heated, the footage you saw was of a fur storage facility. we've also been told to apologize for using the term "geezers." now coming up next, "the case of the cantankerous old geezer."
if you have a consumer complaint, just call this number...
dad, are you listening to me?
all right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?
all right, all right, all right. would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?
your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet.
hot diggity dog! we've got him, mr. simpson. now lets -- mr. simpson?
yo, check this out. black guys drive a car like this. yeah, but white guys, see they drive a car like this.
mr. simpson, you misunderstand me. in my village this is the traditional pose of apology.
you know, now that i think about it, it may be a little confusing. many have died needlessly. i have come to make amends. at first i blamed you for squealing, but then i realized it was i who wronged you. so i have come to work off my debt. i am at your service.
i am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.
yes, he's raking leaves.
if he wants to make it up to you so badly, i think you should let him.
i can see through time.
a napkin.
relax, please. you do not have anything i have not seen before. what the...?
and he taught me how to play the shenai.
thank you all for the kind praise.
when i first arrived you were all such jerks / but now i've come to looove your quirks/ maggie with her eyes so bright / marge with hair by frank lloyd wright / lisa can philosophize / bart's adept at spinning lies / homer's a delightful fella / sorry 'bout the salmonella.
let's hurl a bricky-mart!
not me!
i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
who needs the kwik-e-mart? i do.
i must go to the head office and appeal my case.
but, sir, the head office is in india.
dad... that's over ten thousand miles away.
no.
no.
no.
there she is, there she is, the world's first convenience store.
that's great, because all i need is one.
yes.
yes.
thank you, come again.
how did it go?
do you mind? i'm not in the mood.
yes... yes, a movie, yes.
awww.
and to my son, homer...
...i leave these. a box of mint-condition nineteen eighteen liberty-head silver dollars. ya see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in zeppelins dropping coins on people. and one day, i seen j.d. rockefeller flyin' by, so i run out of the house with a big washtub and... where're you goin'?
that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie.
all right, come on, pops. soldiers won't bother you anymore.
boo!
hm. i don't know if it's a good idea to do that while you're driving.
there are too many leaves in your walkway! why are you people avoiding me? does my withered face remind you of the grim specter of death?
yeah, you made us march in that gay rights parade.
it's rotten being old. no one listens to ya.
dad, did you hear something?
oh, nothing. kudos to you, lisa! kudos!
clean, clean, pistol, uzi, two kids posing as an adult... hey, homer.
except forrrrr...
yeah, how come?
i'm sorry, homie.
well, we respect you. bart, i told you, don't draw on your father's skull.
unbelievable! and just imagine the logistics of weightlessness. and of course this could have literally millions of applications here on earth... in everything from watch making to watch repair.
and we laugh legitimately. there's a mathematician, a different kind of mathematician and a statistician.
oh no, not another boring space launch! change the channel! change the channel!
god, i wish there was an easier way.
yes.
how did you get this number?
are you the person that called nasa yesterday?
well, welcome aboard. i think you'll find that this will win you the respect of your family and friends.
uh... question for the barbecue chef: don't you think there is an inherent danger in sending under-qualified civilians into space?
careful, they're ruffled!
no, not that far from shame.
you know, homer, when i found out about this i went through a wide range of emotions. first i was nervous, then anxious, then wary, then apprehensive, then kinda sleepy, then worried, and then concerned. but now i realize that being a spaceman is something you have to do.
hi homer, since they made me stop drinking, i've regained my balance and diction. observe. i am the very model of a modern major general / i've information vegetable, animal, and mineral.
second comes right after first. so barney, we hear you're kickin' ass.
there's no swimsuit competition, homer.
gentlemen, you've both worked very hard, and in a way you're both winners. but in another more accurate way, barney is the winner.
well, homer. i guess you're the winner by default.
homer, when i met you, you weren't an astronaut. you didn't even know how to use a touchtone. but i still respected you, and i always will, no matter what. homer, you already dialed.
mission control, this is corvair, launch sequence initiated. all systems go.
some good news, gentlemen, we have quite a treat for ya. we've been able to coax superstar james taylor in here at mission control to wish you well and play a little of his own brand of laid back adult contemporary music.
all right, here we go: three, two, one, make hatch blow...now!
with that hatch open, we'll burn up on reentry. that's it! if i go, i'm taking you to hell with me.
wait, homer. if that bar holds, we just might make it back to earth.
aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod.
yeah, dad. how many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?
hey, dad... sell you these for fifty bucks.
those aren't tickets to the game, homer.
with the money you would have made working, you could've bought tickets from a scalper.
that was bobby mcferrin's new one, "i'm worried, need money!" okay, if you want two tickets to the big pigskin classic just get to a phone and be our thirteenth caller!
ned flanders...
i've got two tickets to paradise / won't you pack your bags to leave tonight /
what's so special about this game anyway? it's just another chapter in the pointless rivalry between springfield and shelbyville. they built a mini mall so we built a bigger mini mall. they made the world's largest pizza so we burnt down their city hall.
hidilly ho, neighbor. wanna go to the game with me? i got two tic...
homer, that's not god, that's just a waffle that bart tossed up there.
homer!
are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
well, get out the crayolas and color me tickled pink! oh, what's with the lead pipe? were you gonna give my noggin a floggin'?
what?
wow, these are amazing seats, huh homer?
i'll take two dogs, two sodas and uh two ice cream bars. what the hell happened to my dogs? i want answers.
relax, homer, i keep tellin' ya, you're my guest.
stan, stan, he's our boy, if he can't do it, no one ...will.
heh-heh, yeah.
hidilly ho, stanster.
know me? ned flanders saved me. i used to party all night and sleep with lingerie models, until ned and his bible group showed me that i could have more.
sure. anything for neddie. here you go.
ooo, i guess it's time for me to duck again.
homer, that's our wedding photo.
heydilly ho, window buddy. just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl.
uh, be careful there, homer. that is sort of a new table.
that's all well and good for sheep, but what are we to do?
now, boys, mr. simpson is the guest. he gets to decide what to watch.
good night, daddy. good night, uncle homer.
honey, i'm so glad you're home--
...bless the grocer for this wonderful meat, the middlemen who jacked up the price, and let's not forget the humane but determined boys over at the slaughter house.
homer, i-i'd love to chitty-chat, but tonight's the night i do my charity work.
oh, you poor, unfortunate man. let's get you out of those clothes immediately. and we'll do whatever we can about the smell.
homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at moe's tonight.
...and then they realized they were no longer little girls, they were little women.
homey, i'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with ned? your family needs you too.
that was you!
no way, josé !
well\well\well...w-w-w-well\well\well...
how are my boys doin', homer?
eh, well sir. my entire family is very touched and--
we're headin' back. todd's got zesty italian in his eye.
oh, i don't know...
oh lord, please give me the strength to endure homer simpson's friendship.
oh! almost. boy that was close.
ah, uh, homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. family only. you know?
no, i-i mean just the flanders family.
i can't, it's a geo!
i think we should leave.
before i get started on today's sermon entitled , "what ned did," i'd like to publicly congratulate homer simpson on his recent charity work.
thank you. thank you so much, homer. you really are a you're a true friend.
hi-diddly ho, neighbor.
okilly-dokilly.
hi, mom.
think you'll win?
uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, mom.
i think you'll find that escape is impossible. now each one of you take a floor and get started.
amen, ernie.
you're not done. i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides.
shazam!
stop remembering tv and get back to work.
wah-wah.
homer, what's going on down there?
then stop screaming so loud.
well, hot dog! we have a "wiener"!
well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, marty. but i think i'm gonna have to go with the elephant.
i want the elephant.
you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
uh, gentlemen, i am not leaving without my elephant. hey!
homer, it looks like it could gore.
i really think this is a bad idea.
i think i'm gonna call him stampy.
he's hungry. here you go, stampy. eat it slow. it has to last for... you ate it too fast.
you can't do that, dad. it's cruel.
i think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.
he can't just eat peanuts, dad. he needs plants to live.
strip the bark now, stampy.
no.
no, dad. he's grooming him.
ew, homer, there is a bird on your head?
nah. he doesn't want to learn and i don't want to teach him. we get along fine.
i think they're trying to get some attention.
technically, it's for a giraffe, but i think i can let it out a little.
you'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
we'll pay you money.
uh, here's a better sign, dad.
stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
yes. but we paid you four dollars.
no, dad, he's my friend!
well sir, i'll be honest with you. i need a large african elephant. and i need it today. but i'm afraid this just isn't what i'm lookin' for.
well it is and it isn't, if you understand what i mean.
it's perfect, dad.
well we really can't offer you any money. we're a non-profit organization.
well, we like to think of it as --
you know i really think --
dad, i think he's an ivory dealer. his boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and i'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
dad, you can't do this. stampy is my friend.
i'll take that one, too.
all right, i'll be back in the morning to pick up stampy.
elephants don't have keys.
i'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, dad.
a female deer.
dad, i can't let you sell him. stampy and i are friends. ow. anyway, i want him to go to that animal refuge.
dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
dad! you're sinking!
get a rope, bart!
thanks, stampy. ow!
dad, feline means cat. dad!
thanks, dad.
ow! my hair!
congratulations homer simpson! you've just won the employee raffle!
the job of industrial chimney sweep for a day!
so much for plan b.
uh, sure. i've gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors. ah, one more.
hello, mr... kurns? i bad want... money now. me sick.
so pick, please, me... mr. burns.
no it's not.
excellent.
i think bart and lisa are feeling a little upset right now. isn't there something you'd like to say?
just sign here and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate.
dad, mr. burns hasn't passed away yet.
well, i --
are you thinking what i'm thinking?
all right.
homer, say something.
oh yuck, meatloaf! my most hated of all loafs.
no! this family stinks. mr. burns nurtures my destructive side. i'm suffocating here.
oh, go eat some flowers.
smithers, my plan worked perfectly. bart simpson will live here as my son, and i will mold him in my own graven image. who knows, i may even grow to love him. bartholomew! ugh! smithers get it off me.
i suggest you leave immediately.
that was a heartbreaker. but i did get paul mccartney out of "wings."
homer, that's hans moleman.
let me try one.
huh! what a coincidence. and a perfect opportunity for you to prove your loyalty. go ahead bartholomew. you may fire when ready. hurry! fire him now or i'll disown you. you'll lose everything. the fabulous toys, a lifetime of wealth and luxury, the gift certificate from blockbuster video, the freedom to do whatever you want.
how do you know?
i love you guys.
cowabunga, dudes.
yeah, i guess it is guilt.
well, yeah, but --
the dog has had enough excitement.
ned, homer and i are a little concerned with the way the school's being run.
well, once he found out we were going to get ned flanders fired, he insisted on helping.
can't let dad see me playing hooky.
good afternoon.
i know you can read my thoughts, bart. just a little reminder: if i find out you cut class, your ass is mine. yes, you heard me. i think words i would never say.
give those glasses to the bailiff.
we might as well make it official.
if the jury is deadlocked, they're put up in a hotel together so they can't communicate with the outside world.
it's when the jury can't agree on a verdict.
a conjunction meaning "in the event that" or "on condition that."
let's vote. my liver is failing.
justice is not a frivolous thing, simpson. it has little, if anything, to do with a disobedient whale. now let's vote.
you know, we're kind of like the original "odd couple." you're the messy one and i'm...
ew, what a mess.
you're stealing a table?
ah. is that my necktie you're wearing?
good for you, homie. you know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone.
homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting maggie's birthday cake.
hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! i made a special cake for you to ruin. it's over there.
it's been great spending time with my family again. i guess the next time i see you won't be until thanksgiving.
homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely.
yeah. anyway, maybe they could go to a matinee together, or shopping, or to that room in the library that's always full of old people. "periodicals," that's it.
homer, would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet?!
pardon me, sir. forgive my clumsiness.
well, i think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother.
bart! homer, what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love?
hot diggity! i'm gonna smooch her like a mule eatin' an apple! i even bought me some special novelty dentures.
oh, i see. so if i take your advice / and make your patented move / then my chances for love / will slightly improve?
whoop-de-doo, tarantula town! whoop-de-doo, employees! everyone who's found true love may leave early today!
mom's almost ready for her date. she sure seems taken by this new beau. i feel so bad for grampa.
hello! why it's... it's uh... oh it's... why it's fred flintstone and his lovely wife, wilma! oh, and this must be little pebbles! mind if i come in? i brought chocolates.
he's an awful, awful, awful man, but i guess if he makes mom happy, that's all that really matters.
dad, i'm really sorry, but i charged three hundred fifty dollars on your credit card.
don't worry, here's the cash.
but dad...
evil-schmevil, marge. monty can provide for me, and besides, he's a great kisser.
homer, do you want any cards? homer?
do you want another card or not?
i'm in. let's see your cards.
hey, don't yell at homer. just because he's a little slow...
we don't think you're slow. but, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything.
oh homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better.
... there's that. or, you could take an adult education course.
that's because you were drunk!
gettin' better!
what is your area of expertise?
no you can't, mr. simpson. no one can.
oh, you're married?
no, mr. simpson, what i mean is, we may have a job for you after all. we need someone to teach a course on how to build a successful marriage.
homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. you've ruined a perfectly good jacket.
i think it's great you're a teacher, dad. so, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation?
well, homer, what a pleasant...
can i take your order?
sir, it's a felony to tease the order box.
thank you.
um, how about if we tell you our problems with relationships?
mr. simpson, are you listening? simpson!
you were not! you were just eating a damn orange!
he's a horrible excuse for an educator.
so something wasn't working in bed, huh?
trouble in paradise, huh? derisive laugh)
marge dyes her hair?
homer, i really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class.
today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair.
mm-hmm. i'm happy about that. but, i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy.
homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again.
tell us more about you and marge.
i can't believe i paid ten thousand dollars for this course! what the heck was that lab fee for?
oh, all right. / okay.
we need names!
homer, don't you have to get to class?
what the darn...?
apparently that disturbing odor was the food.
i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
well, me and milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer.
what the hell are you talkin' about? you're the one who double dared us.
me too.
get out! get out! get out!
you, too.
get out!
you just don't get it, do you, homer? you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. i can't trust you anymore.
hey, homer, what's the big brouhaha? ha.
affirmative, humanoid.
sorry, bart, your dad kinda blew the fantasy. i only like it when i'm pretend scared.
funny... the way everything reminds me of homer.
here, dad. i brought you some nice...
dad, that's just a plant.
look, i brought you some nice pudding.
dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. there's a reason two people come together and stay together. there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. if you want to get mom back, you just have to remember what you give her that nobody else can.
no.
good luck, dad.
'kay. clean house, no silverfish... i coulda been very happy here. homer!
i didn't ask her for no water. she's lying, homer, she's lyin'. she told me you were dead. that's the only reason i... i didn't do nothin'!
homer, what happened to you?
oh, here, let me help you.
homer, that's not a good thing.
but, how do i know i can trust you?
look, dad. i missed you so much, i couldn't concentrate in school and i got an "f".
and i have a special present for you, but i'll give it to you later tonight.
so marge, are you really happy, really?
homer, my hat goes off to you.
homer, the fridge wasn't meant to be used this way. although i must say, it's certainly refreshing.
won't this overload the motor?
dad... dad... dad...
dad, as you know, we've been swimming. and we've developed a taste for it. we both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. now before you respond, you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of... canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwe... etc.
over here we have "the hick tub," "the uh insta-rust," that's "the lightning magnet," that's "the tinkler..."
yes, dad.
i'm gonna miss the whole summer.
well, it looks like it's just you and me, barty boy.
dad... you have to put chlorine in the water every day, to keep it clean.
this was a lovely idea, homie. come here and kiss me.
listen, ned flanders murdered his wife.
oh, well i guess that explains everything.
um, i'm right here.
hurry up and finish eating!
oh!
whoa!
homer, that was downright decent of you.
dad, isn't this stealing?
it hurts my teeth.
and it doesn't have nails and broken glass in it...
while you were out "earning" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. the plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in monday.
homer?
homer, homer!
i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. you're being completely paranoid.
hello.
homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?
look, just get rid of the sugar, okay?
ah, very clever, simpson. luring our bees to your sugar pile and then selling them back to us at an inflated price.
simpson, you diobolical... we're willing to pay you two thousand dollars for the swarm.
oh, wait a minute. the bees are leaving.
i'm sorry, homie.
wake up!
wake up!
it's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggie's kiddy pool.
homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book.
no, no, no. no, ask your heart what its fondest desire is.
no, think about people. about moments in your life that have been very romantic.
okay, homer.
yeah, ditto.
ain't you ever seen a naked chick ridin' a clam before?
i guess we'll be goin' down together. i mean getting off togeth-- i mean...
tv's there; bathroom's there; and there's your king sized bed for...
homer, i got a really wicked idea that could get us into a lot of trouble.
no, homer. let's do it. let's call room service!
no more chernobyls!
this was a really nice night, homer.
what's wrong?
oh... well, we don't have to.
well, desserts aren't always right.
homer, you know how i feel. so it-it's up to you. look in your heart. i think you'll see what you want.
yes, what did happen to her?
well, kids, i tried. maybe you're right.
homer.
yeah, you want a ride?
you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with.
my prom date.
why so glum?
ah, your first kiss.
dad! remember how you said that going to itchy and scratchy land would be too damned expensive?
yeah. "dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."
now wait a minute. i'm not sure about this. every time we've ever gone on vacation, i end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. you have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time.
well, there was our trip to the amish country...
don't worry, mom. we'll make you proud of us.
agreed.
dad, can we stop at flickey's?
what's the matter with you, homer? we don't have any fruits or vegetables in the car.
haven't we stood in five different states long enough?
we'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
homer, no. you're going to get lost.
would you like to buy some itchy and scratchy money?
do it, dad.
bart!
tortureland, explosion land, searing gas pain land, unnecessary surgery land...
see all that stuff in there, homer? that's why your robot never worked. this is just what i was hoping for. spending the day together as a family. ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals.
dad?
i have nothing to say to you.
how were you a political prisoner?
oh for gosh sakes, what now?
dad, i think you're wrong about that robot trying to be your friend.
oh my, it looks like we're doomed!
dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits.
hey, mouse! say cheese. hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that i could be an action hero.
as roger meyers jr., the owner of the park, i'd like to thank you for stopping the killer robots. and to show my appreciation, here are two free passes.
here are two free passes.
yeah, switch the station. i consider myself politically correct, and his views make me uncomfortable.
dad, i had to listen to this jerk all morning. can we listen to something else?
that sounds like sideshow bob!
dad, i'll spare you the embarrassment of admitting you don't know who sideshow bob is.
sideshow bob used to be krusty the clown's sidekick. but in 1990, he framed krusty for armed robbery and bart got him put in jail.
when he got out, he married aunt selma and tried to murder her.
homer, we've got to stop them.
yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading archie comics.
i can't tell you who i am, but i worked on the campaign.
this house has quite a long and colorful history. it was built on an ancient indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five john denver christmas specials.
homer, i'm impressed. you're taking this quite well.
homer!
so what'll it be, homer?
no. not unless you kill your family.
uh, they'd be much happier as ghosts.
homer! homie? hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness. feelin' fine, well, that's a relief. this is less encouraging.
go crazy?
homer, it's moe. ah, look, some of the ghouls and i are a little concerned the project isn't moving forward.
oh, for cryin' out loud. c'mon.
oh my, i hope that rug was scotchguarded.
dad, look!
homer, change channel!
one / singular sensation...
dad!! daaadd!! homer!!
okilly dokilly.
okay, everybody. let's see some big smiles. just relax, let the hooks do their work.
it's bliiiiisssss.
are we taking the new lexus to aunt patty and selma's funeral today?
good morning, dear.
homer! the sky is blue. donuts are plentiful. friday is tgif night on abc. what's gotten into you?
huh?
oh that's sweet, homer. our son is growing up, isn't he?
have you noticed any change in bart?
no. he looks like something might be disturbing him.
i guess we could get more involved in bart's activities. but then i'd be afraid of smothering him.
that's not what i meant.
well, jessica, i don't think we should hang out together anymore. you're turning me into a criminal when all i want to be is a petty thug.
thirty cents off shake 'n bake. homer!
he confessed!
i didn't take it.
homer, stop that. i believe him.
that's what he wore to church.
no.
if you search her room, i am certain you will find the money.
kent, i'd like to remind everybody to come down and watch me at the springfield laugh 'n brew 'n burgers 'n fries this saturday. the forecast calls for a seventy-five percent chance of hilarity.
lisa, your father and i are very concerned about this warning. i really hope you try harder.
well, i could use a new pair of hockey skates.
that's not fair... why is bart getting a present and i'm getting chewed out?
cheer up. so you're not good at sports. it's a very small part of life.
i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. how about letting her ride up front, too?
oh yes, we won! we won! we won! um, unfortunately, since i bet on the other team, ah, we won't be going for pizza.
please, dad, i'll be fine.
i can't even watch. i don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
absolutely, honey. by blocking the net i really think you helped your team.
that's very nice, dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. however, i will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love.
come watch tv with me, dad. we missed the first two episodes of cops, but if we hurry we can catch the last three.
hey milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! jimbo! jimbo! go for the face! look! ralph wiggum lost his shin guard! hack the bone! hack the bone!
mr. honeybunny!
hm, i better go check that out. now homer, don't you eat this pie.
i don't care who started it. i don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. we love you both. you're not in competition with each other. repeat. you are not in competition with each other.
you'll have to do better than that tonight, chump.
hello.
stop it! stop it! conserve your precious hatred for the game.
no.
no.
hi mom! over here! mom!
ew. bart, don't put the non-marshmallow pieces back in the box. they go in the trash.
how did you get tickets?
no,me!takeme!me!me!me!
oh, well thank you homer. but take one of the kids.
homer, are all these pockets necessary?
mom! how can you leave us with this maniac?!
mr. goodbar to the front desk... the front desk is looking for mr. goodbar.
as you can see, i have created a lemonball so sour it can only be safely contained in a magnetic field. the candy, known as 77x42 -- where the hell is the candy?
hey sir, try our wax lips. it's the candy of a thousand uses. one, a humorous substitute for your own lips.
ah, you're gonna have to put some sugar on that celery or get out, ma'am.
will you two stop saying "gummy" so much.
no. i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further. oooh... how'd they get there?
halt! halt!
wheee!
i'm sure it'll turn up. take the baby-sitter home now. she's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
i'm sorry?
just drop me off here.
there he is! there's the man that sexually harassed me!
two four six eight / homer's crime was very great! "great" meaning "large or immense" / we used it in the pejorative sense!
you grabbed me in the car!
boo!
dad, i don't understand. what is she saying you did?
oh, yeah. that was brilliant.
and the dog in the coppertone ad? same deal, dad?
we know you're innocent, dad.
you people aren't allowed in here.
homer--
i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today. i told her you were a decent man. but she wouldn't listen. besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more i can do.
hello, homer. this is god...frey jones from the tv magazine show, rock bottom. we're aware of your problems and mr. simpson, we want to help.
that was really great, mr. simpson, we got everything we need.
homer, that's your solution to everything, to move under the sea. it's not gonna happen.
look, maybe this whole thing will blow over.
yes, yes, yes. that's fine. good, good.
and now, we return to fox night at the movies. "homer s.: portrait of an ass grabber," starring dennis franz.
this is hour fifty-seven of our live, round-the-clock coverage outside the simpson estate. remember, by the way, to tune in tonight at eight o'clock for highlights of today's vigil, including when the garbage man came, and when marge simpson put the cat out. possibly because it was harassed, we don't know. of course, there's no way to see into the simpson home without some kind of infrared heat-sensitive camera. so let's turn it on. now this technology is new to me, but i'm pretty sure that's homer simpson in the oven, rotating slowly. his body temperature has risen to over four hundred degrees. he's literally stewing in his own juices. now here are some results from our phone-in poll: 95 percent of the people believe homer simpson is guilty. of course, this is just a television poll, which is not legally binding. unless proposition 304 passes, and we all pray it will.
c'mon on let us through, you vultures.
it's just hard not to listen to tv. it's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
ai yi yi! es homer simpson. me ha molestado. ohh!
see i think about weird stuff. like what would happen if e.t. and mr. t. had a baby? well, you'd get mr. e.t. wouldn't ya? and you know i think he'd sound a little something like this: i pity the fool who doesn't phone home.
the media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. all they care about is entertainment. well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word "entertainment" -- public access television.
now it's time for the innocence report with homer simpson.
no, that's mayor quimby. ah, here we go.
hmm. homer, i thought you were an animal, but your daughter said you were a decent man. i guess she was right.
wow. v8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.
tomorrow on rock bottom. he's a foreigner who takes perverted videos of you when you least suspect it. he's rowdy roddy peeper.
groundskeeper willie saved you, homer.
hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
is there something wrong, homie?
we need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
i simply can't wait that long. maybe we should get some help... how 'bout a book?
a tasteful book.
oh, i'm just reading up on, artillery.
this one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. it's a book on tape by paul harvey, you know, that nice midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of grampa.
homeie, i can't quite...
the arabian nights room looks nice...
the uh... toilet is overflowing in the uh caveman room!
this isn't very erotic. i think it's an actual utility room.
welcome home, son. i broke two lamps and lost all your mail. what's wrong with your wife?
flu?
protein deficiency?
pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcano-coniosis?
oh, homey, what's--
here he is, rex harrison and paul anka rolled into one! that tonic really works! you and grampa should bottle it and go into business together.
you could make a lot of money.
hurry up! we got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: frigid falls, mount seldom, lake flaccid...
all questions will be answered, all fears will be allayed, with one incontrovertible demonstration! may i have a volunteer from the audience? yes, you, sir! now, sir, you have never seen me before. is that correct?
you're the worst shill i ever seen! you're a disgrace to the medicine show business!
hey, wait a minute. that's amos pierson's moose farm. make a right, here.
you, president? this is the greatest country in the world. we got a whole system set up to keep people like you from ever becomin' president. quitcher daydreamin', melonhead. quitcher daydreamin', melonhead.
that's 'cause you're a screw-up.
why you little...!
i'm sorry i said that.
homie, are you really going to ignore grampa for the rest of your life?
you didn't want to have bart.
you tell bart all the time. you told him this morning.
aw, nuts.
dad, number one: i know how to ride a bike. number two: i already own a bike. and number three: that is a girl's bike.
dad!
no, dad. i want to get down. this tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me.
no offense, homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.
dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary.
no, i'm a screw-up. i burned down our house.
what?
it doesn't matter. what matters is you were right when you told me i never said anything nice about you.
well, i hadn't thought that far ahead. okay, here it goes... i'm not sorry i had you, son. and i was always proud that you weren't a short man.
whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?
do i?! i'm burnin' up, here. ooh, ooh, taking advantage of my alcohol soaked clothes. it's funny and it makes you think. oh i need some coffee before i black out. homer, pass me the sugar.
how many people want homer banned from this place for life? yeah!
sorry, homer. you should have thought of that before you gave me the old sugar-me-do. i'm taking your caricature down from mt. lushmore. and i'm pulling your favorite song out of the juke box.
oww. ohh...
cheer up, homer.
what if you pretended that this couch were a bar? then you could spend more nights at home with us. huh?
look on the bright side, dad. did you know that the chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?
right here, dad.
good evening, sir. would you please leave without a fuss right now?
homer? who is homer? my name is guy incognito.
sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink in here.
where's your uniform?
we need a pilot. pronto. who wants to fly to the "windy city?" conditions are windy. you.
hey, you're not just impersonating a pilot so you can drink here, are you?
hi, i'm alan. i'm your co-pilot.
if word gets out about this, kwazy klown airlines will be a laughing stock. in exchange for your silence, i'm prepared to offer your family free tickets to anywhere in the united states. excluding alaska and hawaii. the freak states.
i don't know, homer. we're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season.
i don't want to be a wet blanket, but getting on a plane like that seems like a hassle coupled with a burden.
homer, i've never told you this before, but i'm not a good flyer. i have to get off the plane. let me off the plane. i'm asking you nicely to open the doors.
yes, but i'd rather not talk about it.
well, everybody's got a fear of something.
sock puppets.
sure as sugar.
no, no honey, it's all right. really. i'm fine. i'm all right. mother always said "don't complain. be good. behave, behave. be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."
mm, no, i don't need therapy, i'm fine. and it's too expensive.
thank you for calling "radio psychic." do you have a song request?
dad, mom's getting worse. you have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. look how tense she is.
dad, i like picking beans with grandma.
okay, i will.
fine.
huh, this has nothing to do with you, simpson. i have many, many issues with my beloved smother -- mother.
if money's a problem, i charge on a sliding scale. i can go as low as thirty dollars an hour.
thirty dollars will be fine.
well...
i don't think so.
ready for breakfast, doctor smith?
warning. warning. doctor smith refuses to do his astro chores.
you know, marge. we've really just begun to scratch the surface. there's still the far more serious problem of your husband.
hm, emergency call. gotta go.
put a pan down there.
yeah, we got uh, things to do.
it's a secret.
a conspiracy, eh? you think they might be involved in the kennedy assassination in some way?
oh, homer. don't start stalking people again. it's so illegal. remember when you were stalking charles kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?
i don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
oh well. that was a real nice secret organization we had once.
there are only two ways to gain membership. be the son of a stonecutter...
or save the life of a stonecutter. forget it, homer. while it has been established that eggs contain cholesterol, it has not yet been proven conclusively that they actually raise the level of serum cholesterol in the human bloodstream.
you got it all wrong, homer. it's not like that.
everyone likes you. you're a wonderful person.
i'm sure it's nothing personal, homer.
i'm a member.
you don't know what they do there, do you?
dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore grampa?
i'm a member.
what?
oh sure. let's see... i'm an elk, a mason, a communist... i'm the president of the gay and lesbian alliance for some reason... ah, here it is. the stonecutters.
okay, okay, homer. you're in. just don't point that thing at me!
as soon as number one gets here.
we call each other by number, not by name. carl is number 14, i'm number 12. burnsie is number 29.
thank you, sir, may i have another? patience, monty. climb the ladder.
of this chapter. there are chapters all over the world. and it has been foretold that someday a chosen one will...
happy landings.
this ritual is called "crossing the desert." and this we call "the unblinking eye."
and now the final ordeal: the paddling of the swollen ass... with paddles.
well to be honest, i never got around to ordering that part for ya, so uh, it's still gonna be a couple of weeks.
yes.
yes, yes.
same old space, huh, dad?
well... no. we've got the same chair.
your membership pack.
i still don't believe all the founding fathers were stonecutters.
we just created the greatest democracy on earth, you low-life commoner.
homer, a man who called himself "you know who" just invited you to a secret "wink wink" at the "you know what." you certainly are popular now that you're a stonecutter.
who robs cave fish of their sight? /
thank you. tonight we are here to commemorate our glorious society's 1500th anniversary. and in honor of this momentous occasion, we're having ribs.
homer!
/ this is just appalling and outrageous.
/ that's it!
the mark!
you are the chosen one, whom the sacred parchment prophesied would lead us to glory. now to the top of mount springfield for the coronation! remove the stone of shame!
remember, dad. all glory is fleeting.
beware the ides of march.
dad, i know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever. don't you see? getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
another strike for the chosen one! hurrah!
absolutely.
no, no, homer. you have a... royal... sampler.
"good one, chosen one." etc.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
yay!
you're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
dad, that doesn't help people.
silence! i now call to order the first meeting of the ancient mystic society of nohomers.
homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these colobus monkeys. somebody's gonna get parasites.
i meant our wedding rings.
incorrect. look. a canal.
or a fjord.
okay, tv off. it's family time.
all right, family time begins now. homer!
why don't we all look at the photo album?
yeah, yeah, yeah two. let's get to the baby pictures.
why aren't there any pictures of maggie?
get the camera ready, bart very seepy.
attention american workers. your plant has been taken over by an all-star team of free-lance terrorists.
homer! tell the story right.
your paychecks, gentlemen.
but homer, how're you gonna make a living?
hey, what did we do?
is that so?
he's gettin' a pretty good sound outta that guy.
sure.
show up tomorrow. bring three rags. oh, and a change of pants.
i don't know if it's such a good idea. can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
fine.
homer...
me too. let's go home.
i love you too, homie.
did you have to be so graphic?
so dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?
daaad!
homer, did you polish your head in the "shine-o ball-o?"
okay then.
hey, great job, homer. / thanks a lot./ you're the best.
hey, i'm just hangin'. homie, i--
hey, just heard the news over the squawk box. that's nice work, homer.
oh mr. simpson, i have just heard about the little bundle of joy. congratulations, sir.
hey homer, way to get marge pregnant. heh, heh, heh.
oh really.
by the way, congratulations on your new job, homer.
wow, dad. you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?
actually, when i was about to have bart...
and then when i told him about lisa...
i'll stay here, but i'm gonna think about products i might like to purchase. ooh, i don't have that.
homer! let your father tell the story.
okay, but i know funny.
homer, you had a head.
you've worked hard at the bowling alley. why don't you ask for a raise?
oh.
anyway, we all pitched in and we got you this little goin' away thing.
see ya 'round, mr. homer.
yes, are you a new applicant?
so, come crawling back, eh?
well, actually -
my contractions started an hour ago.
argh -- you're truly the catch of the day!
one more push should do it.
congratulations, mr. simpson. you have a beautiful, healthy baby.
homie, i think someone is saying hello.
uh, that's the umbilical cord. it's a girl.
so, you loved her right from the start.
then why no pictures?
sounds like you had a good day today, dad.
no, dad, i don't think...
homer, what if this doesn't work?
dad, the plan!
dad!
daaad, they're firing the rocket!
we're doomed!
turn it off.
wow, dad. maybe you're right.
we have a bomb shelter?
hi-de-ho-e-roonie, neighbor. what can i do you for?
i kinda figured this might happen, so i built the shelter big enough for both our families.
one more hour.
all right!
and it will need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me. um, and someone will have to run the power. uh, you can do that, homer.
okay, let's start again. we'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip -- that's mrs. lovejoy...
say moe, was it a duck?
yeah, dad was right.
finders keepers.
hey, homer. the section you're supposed to be monitoring is on fire.
i think i'll have some wine.
yes, homie?
i don't think any of us expected him to say that.
yeah dad, it was bad enough when you tried to pass yourself off as tom bosley. but krusty!
new hampshire.
okay, we'll start off with the baggy p...wha? those are supposed to be baggy pants. baggy!
okay, memorize these funny place names. walla walla, keokuk, cucamonga, seattle...
and now everybody's favorite, the "spin cycle fantastique" trick. it's a great piece of buffoonery if you pull it off, but if you blow it, you'll look like a fool.
now, when the wealthy dowager comes in, the party's over, right? wrong.
this is the happiest day of my life. a-yah-ha.
it's the krusty burglar!
i'm a boy.
hey, nice threads.
boy, you're really running yourself ragged.
well my time's almost up here, so uh, i'd just like to say i know woody allen.
let's walk and talk. i ah, i have some wonderful stories about other famous people that include me in some way.
hey! me too! we can go together.
your churlish attitude reminds me of the time i was having dinner with groucho, and...
well, well, well "velocity boy," i am gonna give you the biggest ticket you... hey! krusty!
oh, to think i was going to give you a ticket! krusty the klown!
hey krusty, krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set those beavers loose in that pine furniture store? memories. all right, you take it easy, krusty.
i'm not saying it won't work. i'm just saying it's dishonest.
right, boss.
well, i can't give you the car, krusty... but i can let you have this little number for practically nothing. only thirty-eight thousand.
these are speed holes. they make the car go faster.
whatcha diddily doin', neighbor?
is that so? well gee... maybe the old flandersmobile could use a... lucky i always keep a bible close to my heart. lucky i was wearing an extra large piece of the true cross today. i think i'll go inside.
the same homer simpson who crashed his car through the wall of our club?
the same barney gumbel who keeps taking pictures of my sister?
i am so glad i had a chance to meet you before we did this, krusty, because i am a great-a fan. don vittorio dimaggio.
sorry, i have to do this, krusty. i cannot do it. to murder a funnyman of such genius would be a crime. tell you what, krusty. do for me my favorite trick where you ride the little bike through the loop, and i will let you live.
go! go!
i am confused.
without the loop, it is nothing.
i know i've seen it go the other way. ah, faithful toilet. you'll prove me right. 
are we in any dange--
hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... i'm being indicted for fraud in australia.
yes'm.
anyway, the "down under" fad fizzled, and the diplomatic climate turned absolutely frosty. oops. let's pretend we didn't see that. and bart's childish taunting agitated the aussies further.
well, it's too late to merely pay back the money, but as a sign of good faith to our australian friends, we'd like to imprison bart for five years.
you're sure now, the prison train is sailing... okay, i'm not hearing a lot of support for prison. there is one other option. they'll drop the charges if... bart makes a public apology in australia.
no. to combat homesickness, we've installed a device that makes them swirl the correct, american way.
actually, sir, the embassy is considered american soil, sir.
homer, that's enough.
all right, all right, you win. i see you've played knife-y spoony before.
something wrong, yank?
well, you're free to go, bart. right after your additional punishment.
well, a mere apology would be a bit empty, eh? let the booting begin!
yuh-oh.
mr. simpson, shhsh! disparaging the boot is a bootable offense. it's one of their proudest traditions.
hey! we can get away in their pouches! ewww. it's not like in cartoons.
liiiiisa!
thank you, bart. i promise i won't make fun of you later for this.
yeah, homer. what's your secret investment?
uh, pumpkins?
homer, you knucklebeak, i told you a hundred times, you gotta sell your pumpkin futures before halloween. before!
hello, homer.
yeah, homer, let your wife have a glimpse of success, for once.
i'm sorry. homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man.
i wish you wouldn't put homer down like that. he may not be a big success like you, but i can always count on him to provide for the family.
congratulations, mr. simpson. this invention of yours has made us all rich. especially you. it's simple, yet ingenious and it fits right in the palm of your hand! every person in america now owns one of these, and in many cases three or four.
why would you need to see it? you're the genius who invented... the product in question.
now don't worry. you'll get to see it just as soon as we unveil our new ad campaign.
homer! homer, wake up. there's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime.
money problems? homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?
sure, homer, i can loan you all the money you need. however since you have no collateral, i'm gonna have to break your legs in advance.
i understand that, mr. simpson. but according to our computer, your credit history is not good. it says here that you've been pre-declined for every major credit card. it also says that you once grabbed a dog by the hind legs and pushed him around like a vacuum cleaner.
yeah, well it all goes on your permanent record. i'm sorry, but if you don't come up with that money by tomorrow-- the bank is going to take your house.
well we'll look for the house with no numbers.
well then we'll look for the house next to the house with no numbers.
you're certainly in a good mood tonight, dad.
now bring us some extra chairs, like a good blubber-in-law!
it means...
this has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. i'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, montreal morn.
oh, our fun hasn't begun yet.
you are?
let's go, homer. on the way home, we're all stopping at moe's for a zima.
am i wrong, or did it just get fatter in here?
permission pending. first, light our cigarettes.
c'mon, homer. you can't spell obsequious without "iou."
well, marge was always a good speller. let's ask her.
ah-ah-ah-ah! just for that you have to crawl around on the floor like the dog you are.
what's going on in here?
what's that paper?
homer, is this projection accurate? did you borrow money from my sisters?
he blew all your savings on jack-o-lanterns.
homer, homer why didn't you tell me?
not too good, lisa. frankly, he's underneath the table.
but i like to make you breakfast.
dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival.
need money fast? got no experience? step up to elegance. become a limo driver at classy joe's.
i didn't turn it on. i thought you turned it on.
uhm, thanks.
homer, it's not that easy. it takes the genius of carl reiner and the rhythm and timing that only he and i...
evening simpson... you got a short in your taillight. it started blinkin' when you made that turn. let's see your chauffeur's license.
"tested," homer, god tested moses. and try to be nice to my sisters. it's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time.
well, well, well. look who needs us again to get his chauffeur's license.
failed to check blind spot, minus two points.
ooh, seat belt twisted, minus one point.
grazed a cone, minus five points.
so homer, how'd you do?
well uh, we.... uh... she uh...
wait a minute, those are yours, sir?
both of them?
homer, i'm -- i'm speechless. you just saved our hides.
that's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
if there's anything we can do to make it up...
or, say, we could let you pass your driver's test.
uh... well...
no, homer.
this is horrible. people will start to avoid springfield.
hello, i'm bart simpson. in the past, i've brought you such classic films as "homer in the shower," and "homer on the toilet." and now, i give you... "the eternal struggle."
i like him. he's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance...
uh, i wasn't talking about you, dad.
"you can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."
it's supposed to say jay's name, not yours.
oh, nice to meet you, marge. i saw your hair from the plane. and you must be the man who didn't know if he had a pimple or a boil.
uh oh. i smell another cheap cartoon crossover.
homer, the guest should get the last pork chop.
thank you!
how droll.
muh... muh... muh...
making out the jury list for the film festival. mayor quimby -- krusty -- jay --
yes.
no reason.
yes.
you don't have to do this.
i don't think you're stupid.
next.
hans moleman productions presents "man getting hit by football."
this isn't "america's funniest home videos."
i think we have a winner.
two to two. well, homer, it all comes down to you.
why don't we all take a five minute break? it'll clear our heads.
how many times have i heard rex reed say that?
well, homer.
don't cry for me. i'm already dead.
beer here!
homie, you voted for the right movie. i'm glad you were on the jury.
yon meat 'tis sweet as summer's wafting breeze.
mine ears are open only to the pleas of those who speak ye old english.
whatever.
...except for the international market it's my...
hey, hey there with the personal calls simpson.
homer, don't take this personally, but i've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding.
oh lisa!
now throw compost on it!
oh, still warm.
homer! bart! maggie! company eating rules.
anyway, hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. i also crush cars into cubes. and on the side, i promote local tough man contests. basically i'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til i go to law school.
yes, we have that one in england too, mr. simpson.
maggie! don't talk with your mouth full.
hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
that's true.
you know, fox turned into a hard-core sex channel so gradually, i didn't even notice.
well, here goes nothing. mom, dad, meet homer simpson.
hi, dad.
thanks.
dad, you're babbling.
hey, dad. did you forget to give those cufflinks to hugh?
well?
hi, dad.
wow!
wow. what else did you do, dad?
who took all my test papers off the refrigerator and tore them up?!
well, i'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?
my strobe light!
yes, the dog...
homer, hold on to the wheel!
hey!
look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him!
oh, this place is so big. do you think we should split up and look for them, homie? homie?
and they're off! she's the fastest jumps out to an insurmountable lead!
as they round the far turn, it's she's the fastest, followed by always comes in second and i'm number three...
aww...
look, it's twins!
oh, homie, aren't they adorable?
look at branford ii! isn't that cute? he thinks he's one of the models, inc.
yeeesch! this house stinks! you're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?
yeah, they ate all my socks! i have to wear lisa's to school today!
well, i have to coordinate, don't i?
nooooooo!
all right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. as long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. on a completely unrelated topic, i'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight.
...and i know the little fellas would love romping around my many acres, chasing my many cars, drinking from my many toilets...
she's right, homer. there's something about his face i don't trust.
my, he certainly took that well.
but dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive.
relax? i can't relax. nor can i yield, relent, or... only two synonyms? oh my god! i'm losing my perspicacity!
i'm worried about the kids, homie. lisa's becoming very obsessive. this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat.
that's it. we have to get them back to school.
exhausting. it took the children forty minutes to locate canada on the map.
there's no way i'll get into an ivy league school now. at this rate i probably won't even get into vassar.
no thanks to you, homer.
um, the guy who chopped up george washington?
mom, i think he's serious.
don't worry, son, you'll be fine. this boy's appendix is inflamed and about to burst, which will make it easier to find once i get in there .
hot dogs! get your hot dogs here!
now homer, please. the boy has just had a very serious operation.
bleeding gums was my hero and i never got to tell him how i felt.
but he was the only person who had the same love for music that i do. thank you. oh dad, why did he have to die?
uh huh.
yeah.
oh, dad!
lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and bleeding gums was a good friend to you. but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them.
saxophone! he was a jazz musician. you didn't know him! nobody knew him! but he was a great man! and i won't rest until all of springfield knows the name of bleeding gums murphy!
hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him.
that's mary had a little lamb.
aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
ah, c'mon, homer, there's lasers. you like lasers.
devilishishly satirical. i wonder if anyone else got that?
three card monte.
homie, these games are fixed.
somebody stop him! he's getting away!! c'mon! c'mon!
we'll try to make it twelve.
ah, i think i'm okay. it was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating.
oh for crying out loud...
i borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?
you got it, little buddy.
homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. you'll always be the man of this house.
wow, mom, i never pictured you as any kind of authority figure before.
homer, give me my pepper spray.
mom's police tape isn't a toy, dad.
bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... oh my lord!! something horrible has happened!
oh.
yeah.
hey, great news, guys. i picked up a nudie deck for our game.
hey, homer, you sure it's okay to smoke cuban cigars and gamble here now that your uh, wife's a cop?
homer, please, please, ix-nay on the ohammar-may.
c'mon, put that away. those radar guns give you cancer.
we'll be goin'... / we'll just be goin'... / we don't want no trouble, officer...
i didn't mean to.
i'm still all those things. only now i'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system.
everywhere i look, someone is breaking the law. dog, no leash. man littering. horse not wearing diaper. car parked across three handicapped spaces... homer!
homer, i'm on duty.
you have to move your car.
i'm gonna pretend i didn't hear that, but you have to move your car now.
oh, that's it. i'm gonna write you a ticket.
you're breaking the law.
homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense.
you have the right to remain silent...
all right, simpson, you're free to go.
i'm sorry i had to arrest you, homer. but what i did was right. someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there.
hey, homer, i'm worried about the beer supply. after this case and the other case, there's only one case left. yeah, yeah, barney's right. / yeah. / let's get some more beer. / hey what about some beer? / yeah, barney's right!
i'll, i'll-i'll get it, homer.
"garage?" hey fellas - "the garage". ooo la de da, mr. frenchman.
and what better place to make the buy than in a cop's garage where no one would suspect a thing.
not so fast.
maybe you should just stop entirely.
no, it's officer simpson - of the police!
homer!
freeze! freeze! every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
so long, gotta catch the 501.
that's my ambulance! i called for it four hours ago.
that the pants would rip?...
that's some nice work, simpson. but um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence.
oh, homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?
death to shelbyville!
isn't there anything we can do?
well, okay, but, you know, just go a little bit easy on the...
keep your voices down, boys. we didn't come this far to get found out.
but they stole our lemon tree!
bust in here and take it? you must be stupider than you look.
there's got to be a way to get that tree back. hey, look. a hospital! pull in there.
i'll get the gate.
it won't start! something's draining the battery?!
we made it!
precisely.
my name is the return address, you senseless dunderpate! smithers, who is this nincompoop?
well, um, yeah. i guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?
i have an idea.
when my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. after that, she never forgot him.
oh, no. that's awful, mr. puente. what? oh. he owns the nuclear power plant. yeah, i'd like to settle his hash, too. dad, how can you work for a man like mr. burns?
"marge, bart, lisa, and maggie." dad, this doesn't have your name on it.
who is that bafflewit? / ...lummox? / puddinghead? / mooncalf? / limpnoodle? / goldbricker? drizzlepuss? / cueball? / fumblefist? / galoot?
look out!
who the devil are you?!
what? what are you talking about? clearly make sense, man. i can't understand a word you're saying. you're just babbling incoherently like some sort of...
he robbed the school of tito!
everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr. burns. even us. bart, he broke your dog's legs. grampa, he destroyed your home. and dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name.
could not!
we don't have an outhouse.
hey, homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down burns' sun blockin' machine. you wanna come with?
actually, mom, in 95% of cases, it is. the rest of the time, it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.
who the devil are you?
who wants chocolate ice cream?
hey-ho. look what i found under mr. simpson's car seat.
okay, mom. anyway, my point is, the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems. like those fingerprints. they could've gotten on the gun some other way. are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice cream cones?
homer simpson?
homer simpson.
ho-mer simp... son. ho... mersimp... son.
mersimp... son... what is the... mer... meaning of this? smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me?
bart, why are you talking like that?
yeah.
you're right, lis. i can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to god.
we'll run that cable through here.
heh, yes i did.
eh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together.
you saying we're not working?
enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself.
you did the right thing by telling me. shoo! get outta here!
"good for a three hour getaway at the mingled waters health spa." mineral bath, facial, massage... how did you afford these?
well, you'll notice how the heated gas pedal warms your feet while -- ...gently massages your buttocks. well, count homer, shall we discuss the--
homie, this is so sweet. but i can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess...
what about maggie?
don't do that!
this is so relaxing. homie, this was a wonderful idea.
yes. they should be here. those parents better have a good excuse.
parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
oh, bitch, bitch, bitch.
i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. that is so like me.
can you see them?
no, i don't care for children.
and margaret?
it's maggie!
i can see you sincerely want your children back. but you have a lot to learn about being parents. before i can return your children, you'll have to complete a course called family skills. it teaches parents to listen to their...
but it's important to...
but there's more to it than...
mr. simpson, would you please --
this is so humiliating.
it's so quiet here without the kids.
i miss the way bart would say something and then say "dude."
you mean maggie?
we've never been separated from the kids for so long. i don't know how much more i can take. there's bart's ring!
paw, i cut myself on the screen door again.
i love you, paw!
we missed you so much! he's going to baptize our children?
where we going? where we going?
do you reject satan, and all his empty promises?
wow, dad, you took a baptismal for me. how do you feel?
wait, homer. what did you just say?
oh, fair enough.
so, what was it like at the flanders' house?
there was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though.
yeah. family restaurants. that's where the big bucks are. i could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family, huh?
so come on. i need a name that says friendly, all-american cooking.
nah. i want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time.
oh boy. the deep fryer's here. i got it used from the navy. you can flash-fry a buffalo in forty seconds.
nothing.
come to uncle moe's for family fun / it's good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
hiya, folks! welcome to uncle moe's! aw, look at all the cute little minors.
right this way, homer.
i can't take this anymore. i want my soul and i want it now!
yeah. yeah, you know, that actually makes me feel a little better.
what?
are we there yet?
are we there yet?
are we there yet?
just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
what a load of crappy-crap-crap.
that's it, honey. get into the spirit.
awwww. awwww. awwww.
hidilly ho, neighboreeno!
can i come?
well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.
i can't eat this. i can't eat a poor little lamb!
no, i can't! i can't eat any of them!
no.
no!
dad... those all come from the same animal.
say what? cartoons don't have messages, lisa. they're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. stuff like that.
what's that extra b for?
dad, can't you have some other kind of party? one where you don't serve meat?
hey, homer. thanks for inviting me to your barbecue.
ahh. diagnosis: delicious.
hey homer, wing me another one of them burgers, would ya? i can't quite seem to stand up under my own power anymore.
can i have a burger, dad?
congratulations, homer. your q is a huge success. a toast to the host who can boast the most roast.
it's gone.
give it up, dad. piggy ain't comin' back.
i'm never ever apologizing because i was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to my room.
you dunkin' your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?
tell him yourself. you're ignoring lisa, not bart.
homer, you're not not talking to me. and secondly, i heard what you said.
uh, dad, lisa's the one you're not talking to.
why don't you just eat him, dad.
that's it. i can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. i am out of here.
hi, dad. looking for me?
while i was gone, i got some really good advice from paul and linda mccartney.
i still stand by my beliefs, but i can't defend what i did. i'm sorry i messed up your barbecue.
sorry, sir. no refunds.
astronomers from tacoma to vladivostok have just reported an ionic disturbance in the vicinity of the van allen belt. scientists are recommending that all necessary precautions be taken.
homer! where did you get that?
that giant donut.
help me! help me, lord!
homer! just give him the donut. once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror.
well, except for chubsy-ubsy over there.
even as i speak, the scourge of advertising could be heading toward your town. lock your doors. bar your windows. because the next advertisement you see could destroy your house and eat your family.
it was only a dream. 
yes.
it all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. we were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
homer? get ready. patty and selma will be here any minute.
sorry, dad. this is our spot.
nuh-uh, 'cause we called it.
well, we're calling it now.
'fraid so.
do you see a light, homer?
you're gonna help us clean and organize 'em. and pry out all the dead hermit crabs. get a screwdriver.
hey! you can just suck 'em out!
homer? where are you?
do you see towels? if you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again.
ah, the shower!
we better call ned. he has a ladder.
hunh. it's like he just disappeared into fat air.
move into the light, my son.
homer, this is your physician, dr. julius hibbert. can you tell us what it's like in there?
but suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe, along the hypothetical z axis there. this forms a three-dimensional object known as a "cube" or a "frinkahedron", in honor of its discoverer .
enough of your borax, poindexter! a man's life is at stake! we need action! take that, you lousy dimension!
no, pops, it's too risky. for all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large...
cool, man!
i'll save you, dad. oh, i can't get any closer! you'll have to jump!
well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic.
hmm... that one!
yeah. every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout. especially my big fat mouth.
raise your right hock. aerate! raise your left hock. aerate! i want to see more teddy roosevelts and less franklin roosevelts!
actually, homer, that's just one. see, each push-up includes both an "up" part and a "down" part.
yeah, he got injured on the job and they sent him home with pay. pfft. it's like a lottery that rewards stupidity.
yes?
may i help you?
okay.
you can do it, old boy!
if you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home?
i must protest. you're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
have you told mom about this?
da-ad!
obesity is really unhealthy. any doctor will tell you that.
my god, that's monstrous... i've never heard of anything so neglige-- i'll have no part of it.
now there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself. i recommend a slow, steady gorging process, combined with assal horizontology.
you'll want to focus on the neglected food groups, such as the whipped group, the congealed group, and the choc-o-tastic.
lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work.
homer, you're... um... on the towel rack.
here's your lemonade and here's your beer. oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. when's your next coffee break?
hi. ah, er, there's something i've been meaning to ask you. did you put on a little weight this week?
have you lost your mind?! have you thought about your health?... or your appearance?
oh please, i would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--
bad news, dad, we're out of food. we're even out of the basic elements of food. you ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce.
dad? it says "non-toxic."
ah, dad? towel rack...?
... yes, simpson.
work, huh? let me guess: computer programmer? computer magazine columnist? something with computers.
what's the connection? must be the non-stop sitting and snacking. well, sir, many of our clients find pants confining. so we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman: ponchos, muu-muus, capes, jumpsuits, uni-sheets, muslin body rolls, academic and judicial robes...
arnie pie in the sky with the morning commute! traffic this morning is as bad as it gets! due to a fire at the army testing lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the expressway! despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows, 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable!
i like school.
dad?
homer, we need to have a serious talk.
let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?
con: you're endangering your health.
con: you're setting a bad example for the children.
con: you're running the air conditioner non-stop. it's freezing in here.
con: i am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
good. good for you.
i'm going out. i run errands during the day.
dad, what are you doing down there?
hey, leave my dad alone. just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. he's a sweet man and he has real feelings.
hey, look. he's trying to get up to yell at us.
hey, homer, you promised mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside.
shouldn't you be working?
i'm terribly sorry, sir. but i'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs.
well, what i'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't possibly fit in our seats.
hey, fatty! i got a movie for ya -- "a fridge too far."
hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac.
who cares? it's homer's problem.
workers, please! there'll be time for the frozen pudding wagon later! you still owe me ten more iroquois twists! ten hi-ya-ya! and nine hi-ya-ya..!
what can i get for thirty cents?
... one hi-ya-ya!
we'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated.
now homer, if there's anything else i can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask.
i guarantee it. one... one... one... bah! i'll just pay for the blasted liposuction.
hey, where's homer? how'd he get out of this?
simpson, stop frolicking and get to work!
that dummy worked like a charm, dad.
homer?
okay, mr. simpson, i'll just make the change here ...and you're all set.
you sure do.
you awful, awful man. get out of my son's grave.
homer?
oh, homer, you grew up so handsome.
oh, my poor baby. you must have been so upset... but i suppose abe has his reasons.
oh, it's a very complicated story. let's just enjoy this moment.
hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: christmases, birthdays, easters, kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... you owe me twenty-two thousand dollars.
homer, don't be so hard on little... what is his name?
me, too!
me, too. 
mona simpson, mona stevens, martha stewart, penelope olsen, muddy mae suggins... these are the calling cards of a con artist.
she's nice.
i just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. you could get hurt again.
which was?
oh, homie. c'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. i'm sure you were a wonderful son.
oh, i had help from my friends in the underground. jerry rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes. i proofread bobby seale's cookbook. and i ran credit checks at tom hayden's porsche dealership.
but i did. i sent you a care package every week.
no. oh, wait. this.
how many roads must a man walk down / before you can call him a man?
no, dad, it's a rhetorical question.
dad, do you even know what "rhetorical" means?
gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to springfield?
you know, lisa, it might be nice to rest for a while.
we made it, homer!
well, it's 'cause of your old lady that i got rid of the asthma that was keeping me out of the academy.
yeah, just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose through the ranks of the springfield police to become chief clancy wig --
well, there's my ride. the underground awaits.
oh, hurry up, man. this electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left.
oh, just think, lis, that's our pickle brine burning sideshow mel.
and he tried to murder me.
da-ad! why aren't you looking?
why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation... and scrimshaw. thus, i submit to you: we abolish television. permanently.
i feel so helpless. what if something happens to them?
mom! i found sideshow bob's hide-out and i got a secret message to the police and i had a blimp fall on me and i was in an atomic blast but i'm okay now!
prepare to engage enemy. bogie's airspeed not sufficient for intercept. suggest we get out and walk.
i'm comin'!
hello, i'm troy mcclure. you may remember me from such fox network specials as "alien nose-job" and "five fabulous weeks of the chevy chase show." tonight we're here to honor america's favorite non-prehistoric cartoon family. you'll see long-lost footage...never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes...old favorites you can't see in syndication... so join me, won't you, for "the simpsons 138th episode spectacular!" "the simpsons" began as the brainchild of cartoonist matt groening,...the already-famous creator of such comics as "damnation," "johnny reb," and "true murder stories". in nineteen eithty-seven, groening teamed up with award-winning producers james l. brooks...and sam simon. and what better place to premier their creation than on "the tracey ullman show" -- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers. on april 19th, 1987, america first met... the simpsons.
um, dad...
what is the mind? is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible?
thanks, dad.
sweet dreams.
goodnight, dear.
all right, climb in.
aha! no one's around. the perfect crime. yeow!
they're all gone. the whole batch.
did you eat the cookies, maggie.
go on maggie.
as wacky as those kids were, they were no match for captain wacky -- later renamed "homer."
gotta hide.
oops.
over the six years "the simpsons" has been on the air, we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show. tonight we'll answer some of your questions. professor lawrence pierce of the university of chicago writes, "i think homer gets stupider every year." that's not a question, professor. but we'll let the viewers judge for themselves.
okay, mr. burns. uh, what's your first name?
well homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
well, duh.
careful, they're ruffled!
go crazy?
i'll take a hit, dealer. joker? you're supposed to take those out of the deck!
oh, sure. i read all about it. i mean, it was national news. do you still work for nasa?
oh, homer.
your honor, we find that homer simpson's soul is legally the property of marge simpson and not of the devil.
a few years back, bart was adopted by mr. burns. in this very special outtake, homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son. watch.
i suggest you leave immediately.
bart!
those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game.
gotta change that answering machine tape! oh god, i gotta change that tape!
hello, muddah. hello, faddah. here i am, at camp granada...
homer, didn't you get any milk? all i see is egg nog.
bart, what's taking so long? if you're having that problem with your zipper, i can send your father up.
please, bart, no more pranks. it would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo.
okay.
sure. we're gonna have a great day. ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right bart? bart? what's wrong, honey?
oh, homie. look at that watch. i've always wanted a watch like that.
i thought i told you: no returns for busted merchandise.
goodnight.
i always thought i understood my special little guy. but somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine.
hey, that's mom! she's happy again! you guys made a snowman family?
you can't hide from me in this house, bart! i spend 23 hours a day here!
does something smell funny in here?
homie, you want pork chops?
those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
gee, business stinks tonight. where's barney, lenny, and carl?
awwww.
that i cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well. but who am i to complain?
you're short one person.
okay, then, i just need your five hundred dollar registration fee.
no, i will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!
it's sick! and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. like mr. burns.
for what?
leave the rag.
pop 'n fresh! you glutinous little doughboy! oh, there's something i've wanted to do to you for years.
oh, forget this. i am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that.
well, that's a funny-looking strike.
then back to my place where i will get you blotto...
all right.
uh-huh.
ooh.
who knocked down the pins?
good for him!
i can't believe otto picked up a 7-10 split. he's phenomenal!
ahh... we forfeit.
ah, they think they're so high and mighty, just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants.
bart! where do you pick up words like that?
homer! watch your mouth!
we are not wieners!
they made us!
come on homer, come on homer / pretend this is baseball / and hit us a homer! way to go, homer! we win again! good job! etc.
listen here... i want to join your team.
yeah. call this an unfair generalization if you must, but old people are no good at everything.
well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh fellas?
so, who's ready to kick some christian keister?
i've always been wealthy , but this is the first time i ever felt rich.
now, homer, you were about to say something to me...
nice one, homer.
next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think?
oh. i'm afraid i've had one of my trademark changes of heart. you see, teamwork will only take you so far, then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory. now, i must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title. ta!
live from the famous brown sands of public beach, delaware, it's the grand nationals of sand castle building... preview!
that's right, dick. y'know, this year everyone's abuzz about one thing: the absence of mark rodkin. oh, wait, there he is.
why don't you read something?
well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale. you'd get some fresh air and exercise.
well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?
"the dream police / they live inside of my bed / the dream police police / they come to me in my head / the dream police / they come to arrest me now / oh, noooo.... " howdy, neighbor! may i spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?
dad, it's right across the street from us! that fancy house'll never sell. nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
who are you talking to, homer?
can we get rid of this "ayatollah" t-shirt? khomeini died years ago.
i don't care who's consolidating their power. well, we don't need this.
who's "disco stu?"
hey, disco stu doesn't advertise.
king of the neighborhood!
right here!
i'll take that.
we surrender!...
wow, a former president, living right across the street!
actually this is one of the nine states where mr. bush claims residency, dad. i wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood.
you didn't vote for anybody.
that's really more of a weekend thing, ray.
sir, could you pop your hood?
homie. as long as you keep the car full of gas, i'm happy.
and that's why your no good kids are running wild!
excuse me, sir, where are you going?
okay is he expecting you?
you wanna step back, sir. you're trampling the flowers.
wimp, am i?... agent johnson, agent heintz, you men stand down. all right, mister. you want trouble, you're gonna get trouble.
then you're gonna get trouble.
well, that's good, that's good, 'cause i want trouble.
oh, yeah. lots of trouble.
uh-unh, i'm not going outside today, not with those neighbors. staying right here 'til my speech to the elks club.
who is it?
boys? where you going?
president bush is driving on our lawn! he must be lost.
looks like we're experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.
his house?
locusts. they'll drive him nuts.
hey, turkeys! behind ya!
never! you make him apologize for destroying my memoirs!
i just drop by with present for warming of house. instead find you grappling with local oaf.
i'm sorry i spanked your boy, homer.
pleased to meet you. i just moved in. my name is jerry ford.
say, homer, do you like football?
do you like nachos?
well, why don't you come over and watch the game and we'll have nachos. and then some beer.
no, grampa, don't!
don't be a sap, dad. these are just crappy knock-offs.
listen, i'm not going to lie to you: those are all superior machines. but if you like to watch your tv -- and i mean really watch it -- you want: the carnivalé. it features: two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well, durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart...
really? you like it? oh, i'd love to wear this someplace special.
bart, comb your hair. homer, i don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie.
if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?
name, please?
uh, you know, marge, your family doesn't have to stand in the alcove. they're free to enjoy the club.
that place is weird. a man in the bathroom kept handing me towels, 'til i paid him to stop.
yes. they're better. socially better. and if we fit in, we can be better too. so today, while the rest of you were out being different, i did a very good job of fitting in. so good that evelyn gave us a guest pass. they might even ask us to join!
you know, homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf is to lower your score.
i'm the club pro, tom kite. how 'bout i give you a few pointers on your game? now you don't want to over-think...
keep your head down.
pretend there's no one else here...and just go at your own pace. wow! very impressive! you're a natural, mr. simpson.
homer, please. i have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow.
yeah. can ya bank it into the handicapped stall?
rant on, simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph.
oh, quit cogitating, steinmetz, and use an open-faced club! the sand wedge!
oh, a cunning stratagem, sir. it's curving right toward the green... and... it's... there.
smithers, what are you doing up here?
there are no other balls. uh, just these, uh, reptile eggs! ooh, step away, they're endangered!
cheating for me? good lord, smithers, that's patently unnecessary. i'm one of the world's finest golfers! in all the years you've caddied for me, i've never lost a-- oh.
you know, homer, mr. burns holds a lot of sway at this club. if you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating, i'm sure he'd support your application for membership tonight.
homer, what are you doing?
we can't drive this up there. they'll see the dent. they'll see the coat hanger antenna. stop the car. we're walking.
i won't say anything controversial.
come here, maggie. oh, homie, i like your in-your-face humanity. i like the way lisa speaks her mind. i like bart's... i like bart. and i like my old green dress. i didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown.
don't worry, i saved the receipt. we'll have a $3,300 credit at chanel.
may i offer my condolences on the untimely passing of your great aunt hortense. as her only living heirs, you stand to inherit her entire estate.
no, it's a standard clause.
fill out schedule b. you should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks.
you gotta hand it to krusty.
i can't believe krusty is really gone.
what kind of apprentice?
how about town crier? you'd be great at that.
yeah, dad! you're a big fat loudmouth. and you can walk when you have to.
thankily-dank, mayor, i shan't disappoint. har ye, har ye! i declare myself pickled tink about springfield's bicen-ciddily-ti-ten-toodily-rin-tin-tennial day!
aw, they're just family heirlooms. that shouldn't stand in the way of homer takin' my job and--
you're to restrict your cryering to the parade, and selected pre-approved publicity events.
toast.
what would you say if i told you jebediah springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? look. jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprüngfeld. his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight!
he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
he was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. he even tried to kill george washington!
lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in springfield or stenchburg. you know why they chose springfield? because everyone knows jebediah springfield was a true american hero. end of story.
you do?
that won't help, dad. no one's ever going to believe me.
we could?
oh, you're back. and you've brought a friend.
hey, stop! i've got nothing but respect for the office of town crier, but this is well outside your jurisdiction.
question: is your name ridley scott or james cameron?
well, then i will thank you to stop peering at my screenplay, "homer." and if i see a movie where computers threaten our personal liberties, i will know that you stole my idea.
he wouldn't let me put it up.
well, yes, but human decency prevents--
yes.
credibility.
i was so sure...
by the power vested in me, i hereby strip you of your ceremonial bell--
oh, dad, i'm really sorry. i know how much you wanted to be in the parade.
well, hey, it's homer! good to see ya, neighb--
welcome to an evening of exciting quarter mile action ! our first race is a benefit for daredevil lance murdock , who's hospitalized with cirrhosis of the liver !
yah. now i realize caring for mr. burns seems like a big job, but actually it's just 2800 small jobs.
your new duties will include answering mr. burns' phone, preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting with his chewing and swallowing, lying to congress, and some light typing. montgomery burns' office... oh, hello mrs. burns... i'll see if your son is available.
uh-huh... okay, i'll give him the message. mr. burns can't stand talking to his mother. he never forgave her for having that affair with president taft.
simpson, eh?
well, the van's leaving. which one duty is giving you the most trouble?
sorry, can't hear you. bye-bye!
good lord, smithers! you look atrocious. i thought i told you to take a vacation.
ah, yes, simpson. i'll have my lunch now. a single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg.
get going! and answer those phones, install a computer system, and rotate my office so the window faces the hills.
homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. "little rascals" isn't on 'til 6.
eh? what about my options?
simpson? simpson? did you get that report on the accounting department?
is it about my cube?
look alive, simpson! i'm not paying you to goldbrick!
now get cracking on my long division. and don't forget to show your work, simpson.
kids, stop exploiting your father. homie, why don't you lie down and relax.
the telephone has been ringing for some time. answer it.
is there something wrong, homie?
except...
what happened, dad?
no, please! i can't bear another thrashing. just leave me be.
praise god, i think the thug has finally gone home for the day. now i can make my escape...
uh... no! i'm... uh... making it myself! hear that? the percolations are imminent! no need to come in! cease your ingress! stay back, homer! approach no further. coffee's already made. i stomped the beans myself.
already taken care of. cappuccino, simpson? ahoy-hoy? no, you have the wrong number. this is 5-2-4-6. i suspect you need more practice working your telephone machine. not at all. ahoy.
ah, and my dear, dear smithers... you're no longer needed at all. you're fired. ta!
cheer up, homie.
i look forward to working with you!
mr. burns may have mastered 2,799 of my 2,800 duties. but i'll wager dollars to donuts he still can't handle a call from his mother.
perfect. when i give the signal, you transfer the call to mr. burns. after she tears into him, i'll rush in and save the day.
ahoy-hoy? hoy?
mrs. burns is 122 years old, so try to sound more desiccated. and she doesn't call her son mr. burns!
impersonate my mother, will you? and you, smithers! you must have put him up to it! i'm glad i fired you.
stop fighting like a girl, simpson.
i'll teach you how to use a phone, you boob! it's for you.
what did you get that for?
did he die?
bye, mom. bye, dad.
i won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. homer, you go, too.
save our seats!
the mouse.
mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. and dad's upstairs.
hey dad, can i have $1,000?
to pay for a lawyer for my bum.
that does it. one of them has to go.
i've got it! dad, give me $750!
well, first off, here's your $1,000 back for hiring that lawyer. and $750 for the drawing. and here's a couple of bucks for your trouble.
dad, can we have $183,000?
lisa and i want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
dad, what's a "muppet?"
that's not a leather muppet, that's troy mcclure. oh, back in the '70s, he was quite the teen heartthrob!
what are you talking about?
hey, homer, isn't this your sister-in-law on a date with troy mcclure?
this play has everything!
oh... well... thank you...
remember when we were kids, we used to dream about our ideal husbands? who knew the dream would come true for one of us? oh, come on. guess which one.
it was a beautiful wedding. i've never seen selma happier.
what?!! oh, my god!
no, thanks. do you have any fruit?
maybe we can make your job more fun... what are those?
well, what if we used our imaginations...? houston, we have a problem. homer 13 is spinning out of control! i'm going after him!
hello?... oh, homie, hello! i can't remember the last time you called me from -- oh, you want to speak to lisa?
i'm learning about owls.
security guards?
sure!
why do you need me?
zagnut bar, mr. smithers? razzles? skittles? whatchamacallit? twizzlers?
we could have a slumber party.
okay. time for truth or dare. you go first.
who do you love most: me, bart, or maggie?
okay... why don't you...
hmmm... truth.
da-ad!
dad, you tell everybody everything. even moe knew when i threw up on the dentist.
okay. i like... langdon alger.
nobody does! he's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. but that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
whee.
there's something troubling me, dad...but i don't think i can tell you because it's a secret.
langdon alger? oh, i don't like him anymore... okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially bart.
bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove milhouse, nelson, and martin to a wig outlet in knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and bart's working as a courier and just came back from hong kong.
no, no! then he'll know i told! dad, you said i could trust you.
it's in tennessee, right next to the oak ridge nuclear facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb.
...and bart could be the courier!
uh, springfield, my computer shows your t-437 is fully operational. uh, i suggest you... oh my god! oh, god, no! oh! this can't be happening! this... you're operating without a t-437, springfield!! oh, sweet mother of mercy! i mean... i mean... my god!...
no! don't use your real name, or bart will know!
...and then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. why is he always making up those crazy stories?
no! old people deserve our respect! look at jacques cousteau and goldie hawn. you wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
lemme in! someone's trying to kill me! sweet merciful mcgillicuddy, ya gotta open the door!
but where are we going to put him?
uh, yes. but we gotta act fast!
on a treasure hunt.
only if you're ready to stare danger in the face, put your manhood to the ultimate test, and take--
well, things were bad everywhere.
well, now realistically, homer, i've lived here some 30-odd years. this is the first and only bear i've ever seen.
hey, homer, that's a pretty catchy chant. where'd you learn it?
i phoned ahead.
that's specious reasoning, dad.
by your logic, i could claim that this rock keeps tigers away.
it doesn't work.
it's just a stupid rock.
but i don't see any tigers around here, do you?
actually, dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history.
that's the home-owner tax.
i don't see how you can support proposition 24, dad.
ah... mr. simpson? it may astonish you to learn that i am an immigrant.
no. in truth, an illegal immigrant, sir. if proposition 24 passes, i shall be forced to leave this country. oh, i wish... oh, i wish i could have stayed just one more year or two. there was so much i wanted to see and to do and to have done to me.
ya know what really aggravazes me, is them immiggants. they want all the benefits of livin' in springfield, but they ain't even bothered to learn themselves the language.
hey there, homer, how's it hangin'?
oh, you're just noticing the way i'm talking to you now. you see, it turns out i am an american citizen after all. apparently, i just plumb forgot about it. say, let's take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. the ny mets are my favorite squadron.
oh, forgive me, mother, father, i failed you! who am i kidding. i am no citizen. this passport is a cheap forgery. a cheap two thousand dollar forgery. i have brought shame to my parents, to my homeland, and to myself.
i cannot deny my roots and i can not keep up this charade. i only did it because i love this land, where i have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever i want. i want to stay, but as the real me -- not as some yahoo from green bay.
oh, homer. are you rounding up immigrants?
that's nice, although three of you are below voting age.
oh no. that is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of american history.
it appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year.
because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date. the library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after new mexico became a state but before arizona did.
...executive, legislative, and, uh, judicial.
please, mr. simpson, my brain needs sleep. the test is in six hours, and many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me.
dude, karma.
you know, apu, in a way, all americans are immigrants -- except native americans.
no, i mean--
he's right! / you said it, homer! / etc.
"dear parents. due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. by reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."
dad?
dad?
uh, mr. simpson, sir? can you please change the radio station?
dad, please. you're embarrassing us.
dad! no one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! you have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!
oldies.
the what festival?
wicked!
sandra, that was mean.
it's called rocking out.
i used to be "with it." but then they changed what "it" was. now what i'm with isn't "it," and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me. it'll happen to you.
what's wrong, homie?
dad, you forgot to pick up milhouse!
what are you talking about? 
this is an authentic hullabalooza ticket. for authentic refreshment, eat clark bars. and for totally outrageous class rings, it's josten's. gooooo, josten's!
people, have your tickets out. throw your cameras out. surrender all identification.
generation x may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people.
it smells like otto's jacket.
dad, you cannot wear that! that's a rastafarian hat!
wearing a jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
you know what, dad? maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while.
where's the narc! / who? / that fat jamaican guy.
don't commit your hate crimes here. hate crime!
dad, are you okay?
so you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
of course you have a choice.
you don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
and now, get ready for the man...with the iron stomach!
hey, cannonball -- i like your statement: when life takes a cheap shot at you, you stand your ground. billy corgan, smashing pumpkins.
dear bart and lisa...
i don't even know anymore.
is it true that we have to bring our own water?
hey -- i wasn't a weirdo. i was in the audio visual club.
alright, homer! / etc.
gee. i don't like the sound of that.
my god. those cannonballs have practically demolished your stomach. from now on, no cannonballs, no spicy foods, and when you lie in a hammock, please -- rest your beer on your head or your genitals.
mr. simpson, this is serious. if you take one more cannonball to the gut... you will die!
so what's it like being famous, dad?
dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?
what religion are you?
just some report i gotta do for school. hey, you want some pie?
i used to carpool with that guy.
you're the coolest dad alive!
homer, i'm sorry. there's nothing worse than a yellow-bellied freak, unless that's his act. i expect your letter of resignation on my desk.
i mean the hood of my car.
dad, what you just said was powerfully un-cool.
that song is so lame.
well, how the hell do you be cool? i feel like we've tried everything here.
homer, i'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. i was all set to go off on vacation, when i get called up for jury duty. oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums. now they're trying it as a maritime offense. so anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? free of charge.
well, if it'll seal the deal, i'll take a look at your septic tank. see if i can get her hummin' again.
maybe you're getting stronger.
wave bye-bye to our house, maggie. bye-bye, tree.
that was thoughtful.
put food in me.
full speed ahead. prepare to dive! dive! 
because it was the only one in the house. come on, homer, open the door for your mystery date!
okay, bart, your turn, your turn. you got "the dud!"
how come lisa doesn't have to play? why does she get to hang out with her friends?
my apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks is prohibited in this state and is punishable by-- follow me. any red-blooded, flag-fearing american would love the m-320. celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it.
fresh out.
this is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
uh huh.
did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
homer, isn't it about time for the... ...you know.
what's up there? / is it a monster? / we have to know! / what's the secret?
three! we have three kids, homer!
you went into the attic? i'm very disappointed and terrified.
so i have two brothers?
a routine soul smear confirmed the presence of pure evil. it was then i knew the only option was to separate you two immediately. you'll both need to sign these. but what to do with poor hugo? too crazy for boys town, too much of a boy for crazy town, the child was an outcast. so we did the only humane thing.
we've got to find hugo.
i'll start with radio shack.
hugo, stop! there, there, hugo. i understand. all those years caged up in here... why, you've probably never even seen your own face in the mirror, have you? here...
hello.
this is a mission of conquest. take us to your leader.
president clin-ton. excellent.
commence bio-duplication.
what? are you still here? i'm afraid we'll have to dispose of you.
that's slick willie for you. always with the smooth talk.
sure you were, rummy.
well, a refreshingly frank response there from senator bob dole.
my fellow americans: as a young boy, i dreamed of being a baseball. but tonight i say we must move forward, not backward... upward, not forward... and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom!
i am so mad at the secret service right now. hey, who the hell are you?
i am looking forward to an orderly election tomorrow, which will eliminate the need for a violent bloodbath.
ow! i don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet i never even heard of.
you took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
we have roots here, homer. we have friends and family and library cards... bart's lawyer is here.
what lifelong dream?
homer, i don't want to leave springfield. i've dug myself into a happy little rut here and i'm not about to hoist myself out of it.
cypress creek. a tale of one city...
homer! you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
your dreams may vary from those of globex corporation, its subsidiaries, and shareholders.
hello. i am not interested in buying the house, but i would like to use your restroom, flip through your magazines, re-arrange your carefully shelved items, and handle your food products in an unsanitary manner. ha! now you know how it feels.
even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage.
uh... homer... ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the tv trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in cypress creek?
oh... uh...
haw-haw.
oooh!
i am here to welcome you on behalf of the president of the globex corporation, me. try the papayas. they're juicy and full of papayine. makes you strong. like popeye. popeye, papayine. popeye, papayine. see, same thing? same... ah, forget it. how are ya? i'm hank scorpio.
don't call me that word. i don't like things that elevate me above the other people. i'm just like you. aw sure, i come later in the day, i get paid a lot more and i take longer vacations. but i don't like the word "boss". hey, look at my feet.
you like those moccasins? look in your closet -- there's a pair for you. don't like 'em? then neither do i! get the hell outta here! ha! ever see a guy say good-bye to a shoe?
we don't have bums in our town, marge. and if we did, they wouldn't rush; they'd be allowed to go at their own pace. now, if you'll excuse me, i'm in the middle of a fun run. see you at work tomorrow! although i don't really like to call it "work"!
you will notice, my new best friend, that we are pretty casual around here.
relax, homer. at globex, we don't believe in walls. matter of fact, i didn't even give you my coat.
having a place like this has always been my dream, homer. what's your dream?
don't do that. my butt is for sitting, not for kissing. now you tell me the truth -- what's your real dream? your real dream?
i bet people laughed at you when you told them that dream.
homer, don't give up. they laughed at me the first time i wore jeans with a sport coat. i was the first wealthy man in america to ever do that. now they all do it!... didja ever hear of mike milken?
now homer, these gentlemen here will be your eyes and your ears and, should the need arise, they'll fill in for any other part of your body. your job will be to manage and motivate them. give them the benefit of your years of experience.
the key to motivation is trust. lemme show you what i mean. i want you to close your eyes and fall backwards and i'll catch you. that's gonna show you what trust is all about. ready?
3... 2.... one second... hello?
yes? what happened?... when did that happen?... how much of it?... oh, my goodness, i'll be right up! homer, i've got to go upstairs, there's a problem. somebody ate part of my lunch. i'm gonna leave everything to you. we're on a tight schedule; you keep them motivated.
yes sir, mr. simpson.
sure thing, boss.
sports collectibles! wow, a baseball made out of secretariat!
why don't you buy it?
i'm sorry, we're just a little tired, sir. we've been pushing ourselves real hard to get the reactor on-line.
oh, hi, homer! what can i do for you?
hammocks? my goodness, what an idea. why didn't i think of that? hammocks! homer, there are four places: there's the "hammock hut"; that's on third...
there's "hammocks-r-us"...
that's on third, too. you got "put your butt there"...
that's on third.
"swing low, sweet chariot"...
that might... matter of fact, they're all in the same complex. it's the hammock complex, down on third?
uh, homer. one second. i gotta take care of this. very important. 'be right back.
collapsed on its own -- you schm... you have 72 hours. see ya. back to the hammocks, my friend.
you know, there's a little place called "mary ann's hammocks". the nice thing about that place is mary ann gets in the hammock with you. i'm just kiddin'.
you know who invented the hammock, homer?
that's something for you to do. find that out.
hi, homer! i'm keeping two of my fingers crossed that you're gonna have that nuclear generator up to full power by tomorrow.
good. by the way, homer, what's your least favorite country, italy or france?
nobody ever says italy.
why should you? -- it's mine.
sugar? sure. here you go. sorry it's not in packages. want some cream?
i don't expect anything from you, except to die and be a very cheap funeral. you're gonna die now. stop him! he's supposed to die!
nice work, homer. am i prouda you!
i've been so bored since we moved here, i've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. i know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but i just can't drink that much.
i can't get in trouble at school. they put me in the remedial class! i'm surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round! hey dad... we want to go back to springfield.
t minus 1 minute 35 seconds.
aw, gee, homer, could it wait a sec, please?
i'm having a little trouble with the government.
what's the problem?
let 'em go. you'll stay here with me, we'll go bowling. what's bothering them?
well, you can't argue with the little things. it's the little things that make up life. homer, i'm disappointed, but i think you need to do what's best for your family.
telegram.
i think owning the denver broncos is pretty good.
well explain to me why it isn't.
weren't there three indians last year?
no, i don't.
homer, please, you're hurting my arm!
night vision goggles? a bathroom scale from a soviet sub? a suede briefcase-case? oh, anyone who needs this kind of status symbol must have some terrible emotional problems...
some bullies beat me up and took it.
but then they'll just beat me up even worse.
this is for the crummy life i've had to live!
fun's over, fellas. if you're gonna beat up my friend in my bar, there's a two-drink minimum. jeez, homer, i never seen a guy stand up to that kinda punishment -- i mean, you took a three-man poundin' and didn't ever fall down.
there ya go! that's the spirit! homer, i seen prizefighters couldn't take a punch half as good as you! y'know, boxing might be right up your alley!
aw, please, it's the good life, homer. some of these boxers, they eat steak and lobster and salad bar all in a single meal!
their choice.
well, i dunno, are you man enough to test every one of your limits?
and are you man enough to throw a punch, should the opportunity arise?
and are you man enough to give me a sixty percent cut?
i'll take it!!
now, homer, if i'm gonna manage your boxing career, i wantcha to have complete faith in me. c'mere, lemme show ya somethin'...
yeah, well, when i realized we hadn't had no ladies in here since 1979, i turned it into an office.
yep. they called me "kid gorgeous." later on, it was "kid presentable." then "kid gruesome." and finally, "kid moe."
aw, that -- that's my old spit bucket. yeah, i been meanin' to empty that out.
yeah, he was my manager. back when i was gorgeous, everybody wanted a piece of me. but somehow i just never made it to the big time.
'cause i got knocked out forty times in a row. that, plus politics. you know, it's all politics...
homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. you're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. before you even consider this, i insist you consult a doctor.
you have an absolutely unique genetic condition known as "homer simpson's syndrome."
all right, homer, let's see the left. oooo-kay... let's see the right.
when you're ready...
okay, punching isn't your thing. but that's okay... you're not that kind of fighter. what you're gonna do is stand there while your opponent gets exhausted from overpunching.
who's gonna knock you down?
when are you gonna fight back?
what are you gonna do?
okay. you're fighting a guy named boxcar bob.
uh, no. not yet. he still lives at the train yard. but he's a hungry young fighter. in fact, he's actually fighting for a sandwich. homer, i want you to have my lucky mitts. i hope you do better with 'em than i did.
i gotta be honest with ya, homer. i didn't bring you up here to show you my new tar-paper.
no. homer, how would you like to be heavyweight champion of the world?
great. all you gotta do is fight drederick tatum. it's this saturday. here's your parking pass.
uh, you know what? i'm gonna have to check on that...
homer, why are they saying you're going to fight drederick tatum?
have you lost your mind?!
but you'll get killed!
mom's right, dad. the odds against you winning are a thousand to one.
those are the odds they're giving in vegas.
all right, homer, i'm not going to lie to you: there's a good chance you can beat tatum. but you gotta visualize how you're going to win, okay?
due to popular demand, we will forgo our national anthem. and now, ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rum-ble!!!
it looks like it's all over. tatum wants to finish this with one punch. and here it comes... oh, my god! simpson's manager has flown into the ring and is airlifting him out! ladies and gentlemen, whatever dignity remained in boxing is literally flying out the window!
yes, homer, i'm an angel. all us angels wear farah slacks.
oh, homie, are you okay?
i got your tooth, dad!
well, what do dreams matter, marge? i was able to stick up for a pal. well, so long, springfield...
i feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the world series!
well, if god didn't make little green apples -- it's homer simpson! how long have you been here?
i can honestly say that was the most fun i've ever had. the mill, the history, all that gorgeous foliage. i can't excape lisa, our little walking libary!
that's a hitchhiker, homer.
no! what if he's crazy?
we're not picking him up!
there's not enough room!
i just don't think it's a good idea.
he stole my fiancée.
hey, relax. i don't wanna work. i'm so lazy, i took lessons on the player piano.
lazy? you're not kidding. i'm like a rug on valium, i'm talkin' lazy.
i think we heard enough about larry burns for one evening.
oh, "yakkety-yak-yak"... you, foodbag -- do you have a son?
and is he a constant disappointment? does he bring home nitwits and make you talk to them?
i'll tell you what's with me -- the humiliation of having a coarse, boorish, ignoramus for a son!
what's the matter, pop? don't you love me anymore? sheesh, dad and i, we started out great, but now it's fallin' apart, like a chinese motorcycle.
yeah. i tell ya, i don't get no regard, no regard at all. no esteem, either.
yeah, right. i dunno, maybe i should just leave town.
what are you doing in the basement? it's like you're hiding out down here.
and what's that hitchhiker doing here? is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
ahoy-hoy?
yes! i'm missing one son! return it immediately!
oh, how much proof do you need? five thousand? six thousand? i swear, that's all i've got.
more important than money? who is this?
can't we just go upstairs?
kidnapped?!
you know how i feel about hoaxes!
i want you to take larry back to mr. burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble.
we gotta find someplace to hide!
drive faster, grandma! grandma's gaining on us!
shhhhh! some people are trying to watch the movie!
with pleasure, sir.
and where is all that liquor coming from?
da-ad! v-chip, v-chip!
we interrupt this cartoon for a special report.
oh, all right, we'll go. now, the cat needs his medication every morning --
and the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--
woo hoo!
what time?
shall we say ten?
dad, do i have to brush my teeth?
dad, i think i need some fresh air. can i go to the park?
no.
your son was trespassing on my property and destroyed a very valuable stone gargoyle, and... are you wearing a grocery bag?
i'm not going to press charges, but i assume you'll want to punish him.
well, if you won't discipline him, i'll come back and speak with his mother.
she makes me taste beer.
it's eleven o'clock. do you know where your children are?
i'm sorry. this is all my fault. bart was filling in for --
oh, i agree. kids need rules and boundaries.
it's so tough to be a parent these days, what with all the gangs and the drugs...
that's true, but i was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there.
homer, i'm as permissive as the next parent. i mean, just yesterday, i let todd buy some red hots with a cartoon devil on the box. but you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!
"maison derriere"?! i can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent bart to work there?
what were you thinking, sending bart to such an awful place?
dad, we can't let this happen to belle! do something!
please hurry.
stop! no!
chip!
all right, dad, you've been warned. let's go.
c'mon...
is it really necessary to watch tv while we're eating? we're getting food all over.
hello marge. how's the family? i don't want to talk about it. mind your own business.
homer, is this the way you pictured married life?
well, i pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. i pictured napkins... homer, i want to throw a dinner party.
hey lis -- check this out. non-stick coating. oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. wouldn't it be perfect for the dinner party?
well... maybe we could use it once and then return it.
oh, good. that will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham. homer?!
are you ready?
huh. i should have asked them to hurl some bacon, then maybe i coulda had a decent breakfast for once.
you wanna talk? go ahead, luann, talk! why don't you tell 'em one of your little bedtime stories, huh? like the one about how rotten it is to be married to a loser; or how about the one about how i carry a change-purse? yeah, a purse!
okay, kirk, i'll tell a story. it's about a man whose father-in-law gave him a sweet job as manager of a cracker factory...
a man whose complete lack of business sense and managerial impotence...
a divorce?! sure, divorce. hey, you got it, toots. and here's a picture even you can figure out. it's a door. use it!
oh, okay. ta-ta, i'm off to the beauty salon.
i feel terrible. the van houtens split up at our party.
i shouldn't have served those north korean fortune cookies. they were so insulting: "you are a coward." no one likes to hear that after a nice meal.
uh, singles life is great, homer. i can do whatever i want. today i drank a beer in the bathroom.
yeah. and another great thing: you get your own bed. i sleep in a racing car. do you?
uh, just throw it over the fence. let arby's worry about it. that's jerry. he's a major player down at the sewing store.
homer, get ready!
remember? luann and chase are taking us out to hear spalding gray.
you said you'd do it as a favor to me.
fine. i'll go without you.
okay. starla's a temp at k-zug radio 530. she's going to help me launch my singing career. my car! oh! my demo tape!
go ahead, homer. laugh at me.
you know why all this happened, don't you? 'cause i took my marriage for granted. y'know, in twelve years, i never once helped out with the housework.
i could've at least stayed in shape for her.
i could've taken just a little time to... to make her feel special.
god, i was so self-centered. no wonder i didn't see it coming. that's how it is, though: one day your wife is making you your favorite meal, the next day you're thawing a hot dog in a gas station sink.
oh, how do you know? what makes you guys so special?
hi, dad. you know, there's buns in the cabinet.
oh, okay. can i stay up?
you've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. why would she leave you now?
you mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
she knows.
you're very lucky to have mom.
homie, i appreciate this, but i'd really like to get some sleep.
edmondo, don't you think you're taking a lot off -- ah!... homer! what are you doing?!
none! they would have more sense than that.
only three cavities, bart. your best check-up ever. i'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken.
why? am i pregnant?
oh, homie. i know you love me. we don't need to get married again.
what?
dearly beloved --
i will now read the special vows which homer has prepared for this occasion. do you marge take homer, in richness and in poorness?... poorness is underlined... in impotence and in potence? in quiet solitude or blasting across the alkali flats in a jet-powered monkey-navigated -- and it goes on like this.
good morning. one donut with sprinkles, and... wait a minute -- these are not sprinkles, sir!
you have clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them on top of the donut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles!
ah, looks like we put the kibosh on another two-bit telephone swindle, boys. frankly, i would've expected better from jimmy the scumbag.
huh? oh, that's an auto-dialer. this bird was using it to pull a telemarketing scam, but instead he's gonna rot in the slammer for the next twenty years -- bread and water, icy showers, guards whompin' your ass 'round the clock, and the only way out is suicide.
an automatic dialer? is that legal? i don't want you getting arrested, homer...
or swindling our neighbors.
hmm. one dollar for eternal happiness... mmmm, i'd be happier with the dollar.
but you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. it's nothing but panhandling!
why it's the at-5000 autodialer, my very first patent! aw, wouldja listen to the gibberish they've got you saying! it's sad and alarming. you were designed to alert schoolchildren about snow days and such. well, let's get you home to frinky. hope your wheels still work.
that is it, ned! if you don't unplug that phone right now, you're sleeping on the lawn!
lisa! the cops are chasing me. i need a place to hide!
ned, did you plug that phone back in?!
well, that thing's been drivin' the whole town nuts! got me out of the bath seven times. seven!
hmm, pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent, increasing wind... here we are, chapter two: "so your pressure is dropping." -- dad, wake up!
i think a hurricane is coming!
well, need some help there? you know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker. oh, it'll be fun. we're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. make sure we don't owe anything extra.
no, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--
okilly-dokilly. oo, i better go take down the manger scene. if baby jesus got loose, he could really do some damage.
why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
it's dying down!
dad, no! this may just be the eye of the hurricane.
wait. listen, everybody! the hurricane's over.
well, sir, everyone's alive. guess that's something to be thankful for.
y'know, it's kinda funny. the only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. they're all we have left.
glad to do it. / sure. / happy to help out. / etc.
uh-huh. ooh, looks like a loose nail.
well, i've seen about enough.
homer, you are the worst human being i have ever met.
the man who lived next door until his house blew down.
we want to teach ned to release his anger in healthy doses. we need someone so irritating that ned simply will not be able to repress his rage. homer, can you be that annoying?
mmm. he's not responding. proceed to level two antagonism.
ah, he's still repressing. maximum hostility factor.
ho ho ho. very funny, wise guy.
hi, neighbor!
um, did you like it?
mmm, mmm. 'sure are fun to scratch. mmm. satisfying.
oh, they hum like angels. you're never lonely if you've got a fluorescent light.
well, don't look at me... just because i'm holding a pair of scissors. scissors which i need... to uh... to gussy-up these curtains.
well, i just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco.
no, homie, wait!
okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off. but i want you to promise me you won't have any beer.
ooh, look at that adorable spice rack! eight spices! oh, some must be doubles. "or-uh-gahn-o?" what the hell...?
remember your promise: no drinking.
they say he carved it himself, from a bigger spoon.
um-hm.
woo-woo!
that simpson, he thinks he's the pope of chilitown. well, this year i am ready for him!
afternoon, homer. care for some chili? i've added an extra ingredient just for you. the merciless peppers of quetzlzacatenango! grown deep in the jungle primeval by the inmates of a guatemalan insane asylum.
you promised you wouldn't drink!
wait, mister! you're drinking a candle! you don't wanna get wax in your mouth, do you?
his ears if we're lucky!
let him go, ralph. he knows what he's doing. 
you are on a quest for knowledge.
fear not, homer. i am your spirit guide.
there is a lesson you must learn.
no, i speak of a deeper wisdom. the problem, homer, is that the mind is always chattering away, with a thousand thoughts at once.
clarity is the path to inner peace.
are you kidding? if anything, you should get more possessions. you don't even have a computer!
sorry. i am a coyote...
good. your mind is in a state of readiness. so listen well: to make yourself complete, you must find your soul mate.
your kindred spirit. the one with whom you share an unspoken bond... a profound, mystical understanding.
is it?
hey, get off the course, you bum! security!
hi, homer. find your soul mate.
so then i says to mabel, i says...
i'll finish this later. hi, dad.
so anyway, i says to mabel, i says...
i'm "cranky" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. you broke your promise, homer.
don't "soul mate" me!
okay, but i'm not your soul mate. i'm really more of a chum.
find your soul mate, homer. find your soul mate.
either that or batman has really let himself go.
aye... the hotpants.
oh, homer, thank goodness you're safe!
i woke up and you weren't there, and i was so worried...
well, i was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. and i was sure you'd head west, because springfield slopes down that way. and then i saw the lighthouse, and i remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron...
yeah.
...we had a fight?
...and you're from mars.
homer, don't you see? our differences are only skin-deep...
...a profound mystical understanding?
space coyote?
we'll all be killed!
we did it!
but homer, it's ten in the morning.
another duff, homer?
uh, sure, sure. uh, here you go. düff. from sweden.
ah, ha ha, you got me, didn't ya? all right, here you go -- "red tick beer."
just a second, homer, you gotta take a breathalyzer test before i let you drive home.
oh, son, i'm glad to see ya. i went for the morning paper and i got lost, and...
aww.
don't be afraid.
homer, it's two a.m.! what happened?
have you been drinking?
maybe you just dreamed it.
dad, according to "junior skeptic magazine" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours.
i am the thing from uranus!
it's your birthday?
good doggy. good doggy!
well, your story is very compelling, mr. jackass... i mean, uh, simpson. so i'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter.
yo!
now we're going to run a few tests. this is a simple lie-detector. i'll ask you a few yes-or-no questions and you just answer truthfully. do you understand?
all right, homer. we want you to recreate your every move the night you saw this alien.
mr. simpson, it's a felony to lie to the fbi.
i don't believe you, homer.
you're not listening. you're only hearing what you want to hear.
homer, please! i try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. please just let it be.
please, let's just go to sleep.
no, i'm not.
hey, dad. what's the word from planet crackpot?
well, actually, dad... i believe you.
yes, i do. you seem so damn sure.
hell, yes.
what if we don't?
they'll buy anything!
yo, dad, can i have a sip of your beer?
and that is how much college will cost for maggie!
you know, dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. i've really had a great time out here.
i bring you peace.
oh yes we do! i got it all on tape.
yes, is the alien carbon-based or silicon-based?
is the alien santa claus?
uh, were you on my roof last night, stealing my weathervane?
surprise me!
these shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! and look at the fine stitching on "dope!"
well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. i'm proud of you, homie.
...and then they gave me back my 500 dollar investment and kicked me out of the club.
well, maybe it's all for the best...
well, that's the miracle of the franchise. you get all the equipment and know-how you need, plus a familiar brand name people trust. you'll be on a rocket ride to the moon. and while you're there, would you pick up some of that nice green moon money for me, royce mccutcheon.
did you know that disco record sales were up 400% for the year ending 1976? if these trends continue, aaaayyyyyy...
don't forget fat people. they can't stop eating!
here? our plant?
thank you.
oh, cheer up, mom. you can't buy publicity like that. thousands and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring whitey ford.
of course. right this way.
hello? uh, no, pretzel wagon's no longer -- three hundred pretzels?! wait, wait, let me get this down. mmm... mmm... meatpackers union hall... batavia, new york... i'll send them right out! homer, homie, wake up! wake up, i'm back in business!
here you go, homer.
aw, homer. you know your money's no good here. hey, wait a minute -- this is real money!
greetings, homer.
uh, uh, yes. i am. thank you for asking. now homer, as you no doubt recall, you were done a favor by our, uh... how shall i say, mafia crime syndicate. now, the time has come for you to do us a favor.
homer, did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?
oh, it just sickens me. how could you do this to someone you love?
oh, homer, i know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the mafia's not getting one cent of my money!
we're going to do what we do every day. we're going to make pretzels. there, that's the last one. 
i'm afraid i must insist. you see, my wife, she has been most vocal on the subject of the pretzel monies: "where's the money?," "when are you going to get the money?," "why aren't you getting the money now?," and so on. so please, the money.
homie, maybe we should go inside.
alright, popcorn's ready!
damnation! what kind of slowcoaches do i have working for me? ah, here comes one of our fellows now.
yes, you won all right. you won more than you bargained for.
no, you take that back!
teamwork is overrated.
sharing is a bunch of bull too. and helping others. and what's all this crap i've been hearing about tolerance?
all right. let me start off by telling you this will not be a walk in the park. this will be the most arduous and backbreaking weekend of your life. i cannot overemphasize the dangers which... did you bring your family, simpson?
each two-man team will work its way through the wilderness to a cabin hidden somewhere on this mountain. the routes are treacherous, so use your maps.
now as an added incentive, the second to last team to arrive at the cabin will receive an hilarious "world's worst employee" trophy.
and the last team to arrive will be fired.
i've placed all your names in this hat--
tell me, simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small shortcut, you wouldn't be averse to taking it would you?
neither would i. i've always felt that there's far too much hysteria these days about so-called "cheating".
mmm-hmm. if you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an american to do it. why should the race always be to the swift or the jumble to the quick-witted? should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts god gave them? well, i say, cheating is the gift man gives himself.
excellent. and to do so, i propose we travel by... horseless sleigh.
yes, well, i'm older than you. you know, simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met.
we have several hours before the others arrive. what say we get comfy? now we have electricity. this propane tank will supply us with heat, and this doorknob, properly turned, will allow us access to the cabin.
well, i don't suppose the others will mind us starting the party early, homie old boy. more champagne?
oh, yes, but i'd trade it all for a little more.
oh, yes, sitting. the great leveler. from the mightiest pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?
yes, yes! that's it! oh, i could go for one of those right now! the only hard part is getting up.
why, you'd have to get up.
sir, i am in your debt.
hope that wasn't an avalanche. be a chum and have a look-see.
isn't there any way out of here?
simpson, i have a confession. i'm not quite the tunnel digger i made myself out to be.
what happened?
we... should... be... careful... not... to... speak... unless... it's... absolutely... positively... necessary.
let's go. those last three avalanches were your fault, simpson.
we must be covered by a thousand feet of snow.
hmmm... no books, no radio, no board games. ah! a bazooka joe comic. ech! i heard that one 75 years ago.
no, i have a better idea! we could build real men. out of snow.
ah. 206 bones... fifty miles of small intestine... full, pouting lips. why, this fellow is less a snowman than a god. well, we've managed to stave off cabin fever for a few hours. i... i think we should dress the snowmen.
look at them. smug and secure in their finery. mocking us.
ah, snowmen have peepers. peepers to watch. to watch for our moment of weakness and then baff! comes the knock on the head and we're down.
i'll kill you, you bloated museum of treachery.
homer!
we'll be dashed to pieces.
oh, something's wrong with its brakes! gangway!
well, simpson, i must say, once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.
no.
it's my hair. excuse me.
all right... but don't be shocked.
homie, i'm losing my hair.
i was just with dr. hibbert. he said i was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
a nanny?!
and i'll take up smoking and give that up.
but he didn't do anything!
homie, please, i never ask for much, but this is something i really need.
pleased to meet you.
homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one.
i'm here about the nanny job. i'll keep a watchful eye on your kids, and if they get out of line-pow!
thanks. hey, where do you keep the liquor?
teach us songs and magic tricks.
the nanny we want is kindly and sage.
whoo! hello. i'm shary bobbins.
no, i'm practically perfect in every way.
lord and lady huffington of sussex.
no.
i make you read every article in that magazine, including norman mailer's latest claptrap about his waning libido.
my, she seems too good to be true.
that shary bobbins is a miracle worker. the kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. it's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!
ooooh.
can i be a boozehound?
oh, thank you.
the secret ingredient is blood.
we'll miss you, shary bobbins.
welcome back to "before they were famous." we all know rainier wolfcastle as the star of the blockbuster "mcbain" movies. but here's his first appearance -- in a commercial in his native austria.
well you know, homer -- if there's a job that must be done / you'll find it's much more fun.
searching for my lost shaker of salt... oh, here it is.
but haven't i taught you people anything?
so you like it this way?
they're not perfect, but the lord says love thy neighbor --
do you think we'll ever see her again?
'morning, roy!
you should try out, dad. you have a funny voice.
haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
well, here. say something.
now that's just bad. you got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and i don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. next.
that's it! that's the poochie attitude!! do that again!
then you don't get the job. next!
that's it! you've got the job!
okay, homer. let's get a level check on your voice.
relax, homer, you'll do fine. i'm june bellamy. i do the voices of itchy and scratchy.
she's a lady, all right. a beauuutiful lady.
oh, just experience, i suppose. i started out as road runner -- "meep!"
you folks ready to begin?
uh, excuse me, mr. simpson. on the itchy and scratchy cd-rom, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?
can somebody tell me what the hell is goin' on? midge, help me out here.
eh, that stunk!
yeah, you should be very proud, homer. you, uh... you got a beautiful home here.
yes we can!
right on, mr. s.!
are you prepared to die, poochie?
oh, cut! cut! cut! cut! just stick to the script as written, homer. you're supposed to say "please, cut off my head, i don't deserve to live."
hi, poochie! you look like you've got something to say. do you?
i guess...
no refunds! force majeure! read the back of your ticket!
i'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear.
hey, lis, check it out! pogo stilts! these were banned in all 50 states!
oh, you should see the crossword puzzle! she thought that "mindy" lived with "mark!"
oh, but this is the rex mars atomic discombobulator! don't you just love the graphics on this box?
it's camp! the tragically ludicrous? the ludicrously tragic?
well, sort of... but i mean more like inflatable furniture or "last supper" tv trays or even this bowling shirt. can you believe someone gave this to goodwill?
boy howdy!
well, if you're inviting me over --
ding dong! classic! i mean -- that says it all, doesn't it? oh, man, you weren't kiddin' about this place! well, i just love it!
oh!...
dad! dad! company! company!
oof! homer, you are the living end!
mmm, i don't think he's married, homer.
homer, didn't john seem a little... festive to you?
he prefers the company of men!
homer, listen carefully: john is a ho-mo--
you're being ridiculous.
i'm very sorry you feel that way. because john invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going.
what on earth are you talking about?
homer, at least come out and say hello.
come on. you liked john this morning.
oh, geez louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. john's a witty, urbane person.
hey, dad, look what i got! zzzapp!! zzzapp! zzzapp! zzzapp!
i'unno. came outta the closet.
so if you wore a hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?
homer, i don't think there's a problem with bart. but if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. goodnight.
i don't, but i loved hearing it!
homer, john brought us cactus candy!
well, now you don't get any candy. no, that's cruel. take a teensy piece.
homer, what have you got against gays?
oh, homer, please. you're embarrassing yourself.
queer?
what are you talking about, homer? where are we going?
what am i supposed to do here?
i'unno. i kinda want a cigarette.
anything slim!
roscoe.
why the hell would i want to see that?
hel-lo!!
dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?
oh, be nice.
oh, it ain't no mystery -- whole modern world got a swishifyin' effect on kids today. and their mtv's and their diet sodas ain't gonna set 'em straight neither. you gotta do it yourself, homer. and you gotta do it fast.
hey, he's right, homer. after the boy bags a deer, all the diet sodas in the world won't turn him back. then you just sit back and watch the grandkids roll in!
what? you never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!
but, dad, it's barbaric! how does killing a deer make you more of a man?
uh-oh, something's gonna die!
i know this much: i wouldn't wear that hideous hat. here, take this one -- it was worn by yale summers in "daktari."
oh, yeah, let a twinkle-toes drive betsy. right.
nope. something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
hey, those ain't your rats, barn. well, homer, you ready to call it quits?
c'mon, don't take it so hard, homer. you still got that other kid... uh, lisa. let's take her out huntin' tomorrow, make her into a man.
...aw, geez, homer! geez! you and marge ain't cousins, are ya?
huh? you did? wait, man, those are reindeer.
what? i'm not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
aw, criminy! here come the waterworks.
dad, i'm scared.
no, don't! you have to protect yourself!
dad, are you hurt?
ho. ho. ho. ho. ho. ho.
whoa, it's santa, all right! and he is kickin' ass!
oh, homie, i'm so glad you're safe! hmmm, you feel softer than before.
great! well, homer, i won your respect, and all i had to do was save your life. now if every gay man could just do the same, you'd be set.
ho-mer.
oh, you have nothing to worry about, honey.
we're very proud of you, by the way.
but he's safely locked away!
for life!
which is impossible!
you can't ask god to kill someone!
madam, your children are no more!... than a pair of ill-bred troublemakers.
especially lisa. but especially bart. if he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, i can't be held responsible for my actions.
oh, that sounds fabulous, homer. stores throw the best parties.
you didn't remember that. you just saw it on tv.
homer, i've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. y'know, maude and her mother were visiting tyre and sidon, the twin cities of the holy land. they must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong god, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort.
well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but i have to drive to capital city, fill out some forms to get 'em out. could you possibly watch the kids tonight?
please, please, please!
hey, dad, how come you're wearing a tuxedo?
why you wearing it now?
and dad, you look totally classy. you could be abe lincoln's father's boss!
dad, help me out!
uh, i don't think we should be driving here. the mayor's yelling at us.
oh, it's so beautiful! this is what i imagine paris must be like!
i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. i guess this makes us "yuppies," huh, homie?
oooh, malaria zone! that's where all the explorers shop.
isn't that clever? it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building.
oh, i do. i'm just a little concerned about the kids. maybe i should call.
and she is on drugs!!!
i'm going down to moe's for a coupla beers.
no! no more drinking! i'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
but what's the solution? are we so bereft of ideas that we must revive the antiquated notion of prohibition? channel six says yes.
dateline: springfield. with prohibition back in force, sobriety's peaceful slumber was shattered by its noisy neighbor: the speakeasy!
hey, hi, can i arrest any of you people for anything?
aw, geez. i don't have anything to do anymore. with banner around, alcohol and crime are history in this town. and so am i.
sounds like you have a plan.
whoa, bonanza! let's load it up before the rats regroup.
dad! knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
what happened to you, homer? and what have you done to the car?
i don't think it had broken axles before.
that's funny... i used to be able to go down there.
why do you have so many bowling balls?
beer!
you're the one the papers have been talking about. that mysterious "beer baron" who's been supplying springfield with alcohol! how have you been getting away with this?
homer, that's very clever!
well, it is. i've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law...
you're out there somewhere, beer baron. and i'll find you.
yes, i will.
dateline: springfield. the elusive beer baron continued to thumb his nose at authorities. swaggering about in a garish new hat, he seemed to say: "look at me, rex banner. i have a new hat."
uh, dad...
all the beer from the landfill is gone, beer baron. we're out of business.
homer! my customers are soberin' up, and they ain't gonna stay for the ambiance! you gotta get me more beer!
look, find it, buy it, make it, i don't care. just get me some booze, and fast!
you know, they're fifty for $3000 today.
now you're making your own alcohol? that's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
tubby? oh, yes, tubby!
one of the stills --
homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. your homemade liquor is exploding again.
you've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. why not quit now, while you're ahead?
stick 'em up.
yeah, never mind how i look. you gonna give me the money or not?
yeah, i had to sell the trigger and most of the handle to feed my family. c'mon, give me the dough. i can throw this pretty hard.
poor wiggum.
um, who?
oh, yeah... more than anything in the world!
..then, the liquor-filled bowling balls travelled through a network of underground pipes, finally emerging at a nearby speakeasy.
yeah? what's that?
that was a very sweet thing you did for poor wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?
...and he who shall violate this law, shall be punished by catapult.
release the prisoner! on behalf of the city, i'd like to apologize, and ask how long it will take for you to flood this town with booze again.
and so, one town's brief flirtation with prohibition ended in a joyous remarriage to lady liquor! congratulations, springfield! we wish you the very best!
three and a half. we get beat up, but we get an explanation.
oh, my goodness.
homer, bart's up there!
did you check your pocket?
oh, foreign language institute. oh, my german verb wheel! ich esse; er isst; wir essen.
homer, this is yours.
gas your termites... "freeze your termites"... "zap your termites"... "save the termites"... hel-lo. "dear occupant: because of your fine credit history, you have been pre-approved for a moneybank charge card..." hoo, baby! okay, lessee now... "occupation?" hmm, butt doctor. "income?" whatever i finds, i keeps! "name?" hmm, name, name.... my name is... santa's little helper.
and for homer --
and so handsome! bart, i just love him!
uh, to the best of my recollection, yes.
what've you got for me, boy? hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat.
"some call it the dog that never sleeps, though it actually does -- while jogging."
oh, it's against the house rule... oh, i guess just this once.
homer, are you wearing a tie to impress laddie?
where's santa's little helper?
well, we wrecked the first dog. we've got to treat this one right. bart, why don't you take laddie for another walk.
hey, that is one fine-looking animal you've got there.
ha, ha. hey, this fellow's not available to stud, is he?
nah, that's not too likely. but still... you're gone. oh, where are you, boy? time for a walk. again? we gotta find out where he's keeping these.
oh, maggie, you got oatmeal all over. homer, would you clean her off?
no. he just wasn't the right dog for me. i'm sure he'll be happy as a police dog.
we can't. he's not in a kennel. i gave him away, too, and i don't know where he is.
i'm sorry, i know it's wrong. i messed everything up and now i don't have any dogs at all.
i don't want a new dog. i want santa's little helper.
i'm going to get the dog back.
the bad dog.
mom, mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!
i could still use more paper.
dad! you're not supposed to have fun recycling. this is serious.
homer, you didn't tell me mr. burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant.
you found a candy bar?
they're not going to close the plant, are they?
dad, if you just drink one more, i'll have a full bag. there's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
thanks, dad!
sir, we've never met before, but my name is mr. burns and i want your daughter to help make me rich again.
ah, the baby who shot me. no, i was referring to your other daughter.
nothing evil. that's exactly the kind of radical thinking i need! it's a deal.
and from our "it's funny when it happens to them" file... remember millionaire c. montgomery burns? the man who blocked out our sun, ran over a local boy, and stole christmas from 1981 to 1985? well, guess who's flat broke and picking up trash for a living?
wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking.
yeah, he's broke! 
lisa, nobody likes a gloater. right, homie?
oh, i can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! i was a fool to help that horrible old man!
simpson, what are you doing here? why aren't you at work?
oh my goodness. kids! homer! we're late for church! i'm glad i dressed last night.
homer, the lord only asks for an hour a week.
...and the very same goes for ezekiel, which brings us back to our starting point, the nine tenets of constancy.
hey, calm down. you're wrinkling your church clothes!
the dump?
no, no, i don't feel like going to a trash pile today.
it looks japanese.
i don't know... guilt?
well, i think volunteering is great. deep down it makes you feel -- homer! will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? it came from the dump.
hai! hai! hai! bye. hai!
yes. you have very lucky dishes, mr. simpson. this soap is from the sacred forest of hokkaido. renowned for its countless soap factories.
okay. here you go. the phone book for hokkaido, japan.
is it a local call?
moshi-moshi?
hello chief. let's talk why not?
oh, you like mr. sparkle?
look, we got a package from the mr. sparkle company in japan!
it's a videotape!
bor-ing.
yep. there's your answer, fish bulb.
we are home.
he... mista sparkaru! mista sparkaru!
play dead!
...baboons to the left of me, baboons to the right, the speeding locomotive tore through a sea of inhuman fangs. a pair of the great apes rose up at me, but biff! bam! i sent them flying like two hairy footballs. a third came screaming at me and that's when i got mad...
any office supply company can have them made up for you.
yes, sir.
hey, homer, ya busy?
there's a new guy at the plant. uh, maybe we oughta say "hi" to him.
how do you do.
oh, yeah. carl and i each have a masters. 'course old homer, he didn't need a degree. he just showed up the day they opened the plant.
um... yeah... well, listen, i'm... sure we all have a lot of work to do.
uh, i don't think we're being paid to sleep.
my name is grimes, uh, simpson. frank grimes. i took the trouble to learn your name. the least you can do is learn mine.
you're eating my special dietetic lunch.
the bag was clearly marked. please be more careful in the future.
i'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, simpson.
simpson! you've got a 513! no! a 513! in your procedures manual! a 513?! look at your control panel!
you idiot! you nearly drank a beaker full of sulfuric acid!
who did this to my wall?
come with me.
but, sir, if i could...
i'm not your buddy, simpson. i don't like you. in fact, i hate you. stay the hell away from me! because from now on... we're enemies!
ah, it's a weird world, homer. as hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither.
okay, gimme that. gimme it back!
well, why don't you invite him over to dinner. turn him from an enemy into a friend. then when he's not expecting it, bam! the old fork in the eye.
okay.
i only have five lobsters. are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
calm down, homer. calm down. answer the door.
yeah. what did you want to see me about, simpson? this better be important.
hello.
hi.
how do you do. look, homer, i'm i'm late for my night job at the foundry, so if you don't mind telling m... good heavens! th-this is a palace. how can... how in the world can you afford to live in a house like this, simpson?
yeah, but look at the size of this place. i-i-i live in a single room, above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley.
i... i'm sorry, isn't that...?
you. went into outer space. you.
no! i wouldn't gaw, i've had to work hard every day of my life. and what do i have to show for it? this briefcase, and this haircut. and what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?
everything! -- a dream house, two cars, a beautiful wife, a son who owns a factory, fancy clothes, and lobsters for dinner. and do you deserve any of it? no!
homer... homer, why aren't you at work?
you're afraid to go to work because frank grimes will be there, aren't you?
you'll have to face him sometime. and when you do, i'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.
he doesn't hate you. he just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
just a little more... then he won't have any reason to resent you.
oh, here we go.
i wouldn't bother him, honey. he's making some kind of model for a contest. he says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand.
pipe down!
oh, i can't stand it any longer! this whole plant is insane! insane, i tell you! i can be lazy, too! look at me! hi! i'm a worthless employee just like homer simpson! give me a promotion! oooh, i eat like a slob but nobody minds! i'm peeing on the seat. give me a raise?! now i'm returning to work without washing my hands. but it doesn't matter, because i'm homer simpson! i don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. d'oh d'oh d'oh!
i'm better than okay. i'm homer simpson.
frank grimes, or "grimy" as he liked to be called, taught us that a man can triumph over adversity. and even though frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short, i'm sure he's looking down...
well, golly, i'd love to chat, but my son's been kidnapped. you haven't seen him, have you? caucasian male, between the ages of six and ten, thinning hair?
then prove it. i want you to charm the next pretty young thing that walks through that door.
son, it's me! i floated up toward heaven, but got lost along the way!
darn tootin', ya lousy fink! you buried me naked and sold my suit to buy a ping-pong table! what kind of a son--
here he is!
ghost? what ghost?
you know homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show.
yes! and it might look something like this...
in a minute, homie. i have to get the door.
inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?
christian love?
well, if you won't think of society's ills...
well, it's time to say "good night."
he's just kidding. we'd like to thank fox, and the good people at budget lodge.
i know, i'll go to my room and think about what i did.
you know, you do have options. for example, there are behavior modifying drugs. how wedded are you to the bart you know?
military school?! you lied to me!
freak-outs?
look at how disciplined they are. they're just like the terra cotta warriors of xian.
ouch! ow. ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
they're just children, mr. simpson.
please don't make me stay, dad! i'll do anything you say! i'll find religion! i'll be good sometimes!
no!
the wars of the future will not be fought on a battlefield or at sea. they will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very tall mountain. in either case, most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots. and as you go forth today, remember always, your duty is clear: to build and maintain those robots. thank you.
well, he's got more confidence!
a medal? thank you, sir! for satisfactory completion of the second grade.
what a day. / let's get started. / some serious drinkin'. /
noooooooooo!
no, the playboy mansion! playboy mansion!
all i remember about the last two months is giving a guest lecture at villanova. or maybe it was a streetcorner.
homer, i don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself.
dad, you got a letter from the city of new york!
"dear motorist, your vehicle is illegally parked in the borough of manhattan..."
"...if you do not remedy this malparkage within 72 hours, your car will be thrown into the east river at your expense."
why not?
yeah! that's what people do in russia!
great! we're all going to new york!
dad, our baby pictures were in there!
i just think we should have paid the extra dollar-fifty and gotten a bus with restrooms.
homer! homer, those legs belong to the man behind you.
homer, you're scaring the children.
the bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. we'll meet you in central park at five o'clock.
fresh khlav kalash! get your khlav kalash!
no pizza. only khlav kalash.
no bowl -- stick. stick.
mountain dew or crab juice.
only khlav kalash. men's room in tower -- tower! observation deck.
yeah, ya jackass!
what?!
my god, that maniac is heading straight for us! go secretariat! go!
hey, it's dad! right on time!
we're not jumping, homer.
what a magical city! can we come back next year, dad?
let's bake him a cake.
i have no son!
not if you called 'em "stench blossoms".
i'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine's day. i'd rather have candy.
to capitol city.
we're gonna talk armin tamzarian into coming back.
i came up with the idea.
because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies.
because we couldn't find grampa to sit for them.
and i'm not seymour! my name is armin! this is armin's apartment! armin's liquor! armin's copy of "swank"! armin's frozen peas!
now hold on. armin tamzarian is an unsavory character who played us all for chumps.
well, i don't see any way out of this.
but i'm a hero!
well this is a lovely gesture, but we still have to face the fact that i'm not really seymour skinner.
movies john travolta made...
those were the days. and you knew where you were then...
whoever you are, just pass it along, kid.
but dad, i'm supposed to practice an hour a day!
you'll practice me? what does that mean? is it supposed to be some sort of threat?
oh yeah?
hey!
dad, you don't understand. this saxophone is like my oldest friend. i've had it for as long as i can remember.
nuh-uh.
oh, honey, i can't right now. bart's gonna be late!
homer, you're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. if a strange man offers you a ride, i say take it!
hi honey! how was your first day of school? honey?
for no reason here's apu -- those were the dayyyyys.
very nice.
homer, i can't get the baby to burp. could you try for a while?
homer!
let's never drink again.
that's damn fine coffee you got here in twin peaks. and damn good cherry pie.
homer, i want you to look at this drawing bart did.
homer stop! would you please look at the drawing?
i think we're going to have to get bart some help.
i'll play catch with you, son.
two apples!
that's wonderful! but still, can't you do anything for bart?
that's right, honey. if you nurture her gift now, there's no telling what she can do.
lisa simpson has won the nobel prize.
lisa simpson has won the nobel prize for kickboxing.
i can assure you our preschool is of the highest quality. over seventy-five per cent of our graduates go on to first grade.
very good. once we receive your six thousand dollar tuition check, she's in.
our fee is non-negotiable.
sorry. i don't have anything to offer you unless you're a member of a minority group.
sorry.
and sometimes i feel so smothered by this family i just want to scream till my lungs explode! uh... i'll go start dinner now.
hello!
and so, springfield's heat wave continues with today's temperature exceeding the record for this date, set way back four billion years ago when the earth was just a ball of molten lava.
homer, have you seen the frozen peas? uhh... you keep 'em. now listen. if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage lisa. umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the museum on saturday...
i guess it doesn't matter. all these things cost money and we just don't have it. unless...
well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner.
i cannot believe this. i'm trying to give our daughter a head start in life and you aren't helping a bit.
balzac!
but balzac is the name--
please, just promise you won't buy an air conditioner till we've figured out a way to help lisa.
uh... homer?
well, sir, i hate to be a suspicious aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?
i'm lisa!
that one!
would you like an inscription, sir?
wow. so that's how lisa got her sax.
you know, homer... i think we have some money in the air conditioner account again, hmmm?
don't forget the smell!
why don't you make me?
you're a good father.
he's blind as a bat! 
...and that's how an heroic hippo became a deputy.
this just in: tensions continue to mount between springfield and france over mayor quimby's now famous "frog's legs" joke. the french president has threatened swift and massive retaliation if he doesn't receive an immediate apology.
homer, you know how unpredictable the french are. one minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. what if they start a war?
that's not gonna protect us from anything.
i won't.
i know it's good.
i'm happy for you.
not everyone died in the blast, homer. some of us were merely horribly mutated.
and now you must die.
come on, we just wanna eat your skin!
homie, is that you?
all the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.
friends with mutants, right.
good morning, ma'am. good afternoon, sir. it passed noon while i was speaking, so that was technically accurate.
i take it from that little impressed noise that you are interested in purchasing that matter transporter, sir.
sold! but i must warn you, this device carries a frighteningly high risk of catastrophic...
hey dad, can i use the transporter sometime? please, i swear i'll be careful.
ow! someone just punched me in the face!
uh-oh. oh! ow! uh!
bluggh? blarrr! blagh!
oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. i'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time. homer, stop that!
good one, dad.
there's one thing i still don't understand. when bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?
help me! help meeeee! sucker!
blarrgh!
mom, dad, help! he's trying to kill me!
you just made a big mistake, fly boy. hey! it worked!
homer, what are you doing?
if they're really witches, why don't they use their powers to escape?
let us throw open the floor to, ah, wild accusations.
as for the rest of you...
yar... and that's the story of the very first caramel cod. i mean, halloween. and it wasn't long before this yearly custom became an annual tradition.
dad, that's our house.
hey, dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?
you'll see all your favorite soccer stars like: ariaga! ariaga ii! bariaga! aruglia! and pizzoza!
and they'll all be signin' autographs.
can we go, dad? / please dad? / please, please, please? / can we go, huh, huh please? /
pelé is king of the soccer field. to be king of your kitchen, use crestfield wax paper.
homer. we gotta get out of here.
jobbers cobknots ya mucker!
oh my god, homer! they're right next door!
looks like you called me ju-uust in time. this home isn't secure at all.
well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks good but doesn't provide any real protection.
well, i should hope not!
and you can have it all for just five hundred dollars.
but surely you can't put a price on your family's lives.
homer, we need something to protect this family.
whoa, careful there, annie oakley.
well, you'll probably want the accessory kit: holster...
bandoleer...
silencer...
loudener...
speed-cocker...
and this is for shooting down police helicopters.
sorry, the law requires a five day waiting period. we've got to run a background check.
yeah, well, you don't.
dad! it's three a.m.! can't you mutter in your room?
all right. go ahead.
well, let's see here, uh, according to your background check, you've been in a mental institution...
frequent problems with alcohol...
you beat up president bush.
relax, that just limits you to three handguns or less.
homer, i don't want guns in my house! don't you remember when maggie shot mr. burns?
hey dad, can i borrow the gun tomorrow? i want to scare that old security guard at the bank.
no! no one's using this gun. the tv said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder.
dad! the 2nd amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. it has no meaning today.
no...
i'm sorry, homer. no weapons.
no, thanks!
assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately, but they're manufactured for a reason: to take out today's modern super-animals, such as the flying squirrel and the electric eel.
hi, homer.
homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts.
oh, don't shoot. just take the money and get out.
can you help me get my ball down from the roof, dad?
missed one, dad.
uhmm...
homer, i told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table.
it's the same table!
homer, i think you'd agree that i've put up with a lot in this marriage. but this is the first time since we've been married that i've actually feared for our lives. so i'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun.
i'm a lucky woman.
bart!
you lied to me! you promised to get rid of this gun!
how could you?! of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst... the most despicable...
until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. come on, kids.
and that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns.
homer! you use your gun as a can opener?
are you some kind of moron?
i'll also need to remove your tattoo.
all right. vote quimby.
vote quimby.
down here, homer.
come down here.
what about the gun?
do what he says. i'm too rich to die.
homer! you said you got rid of the gun. you lied to me! again!
yoink!
yo, give me the bullets.
no, i don't think so.
well, your cholesterol level is lethally high, homer. but i'm more concerned about your gravy level.
i'm comfortable with who i am.
in this reporter's opinion it's time for our lard-laden lads to shape up. get out and try fun activities like military service...frenetic dancing... or good old-fashioned pee wee football!
yeah, but i could get seriously hurt.
the wildcats!
he's the only coach this team has ever had. and the season hasn't even started yet.
you know, homer, it's very easy to criticize.
ooo, he's quite a little dancer.
yayyy! / i'm special! / wooo! / etc.
sir, if i could just break in for a moment...
do you have a question for sandy koufax?
what?
what?! what is it?!
dad, that was really mean.
do you have a problem with the way i'm coaching?
uh-huh. half a brain, huh? well, you know what? it sounds like you just volunteered!
i don't want to make the team.
are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
good morning, everybody.
what did i do?
oh, man.
you shouldn't pressure bart like that.
you're gonna blow it! that's what i get for having faith in ya.
bart didn't get cut. what a surprise...
but, coach?
yeah. / yeah, he's right. / he's good.
but i can't play quarterback. i don't even know how.
since when?
good luck, homer. no hard feelin's.
ready. set. hut, hut! yahh!
aw, crap.
are you kidding? i reeked!
dad, i've got some bad news.
no, i got hit by a couple of cars. i won't be able to play today.
great!
forfeit? / what? / come on! / oh, man.
yeah, he does. / and how.
you don't get it, do you? i don't want to be your stupid quarterback! i quit!
may i be excused, mom?
homer, please.
he's doing what he thinks is best...
ahoy-hoy-hoy?
homer, mr. burns can't see you winking.
we drove 2000 miles for this?
aw, i don't wanna bother mom at work.
i'll scratch you. the hair. the hair. slut. loser. skag. skag. skag.
such a product does not exist, sir. i think you must have dreamed it.
this thing only takes dollars.
but i thought uter took my place.
time for one last play, coach.
all right, i've got an arrest warrant here for a nelson muntz. uh, which one of you little punks is muntz?
it's okay dad, i can fill in for nelson.
poor bart... you know we had a lot of fun tonight, but there's nothing funny about... vapor lock. it's the third most common cause of car stallings. so please, take care of your car and get it checked. i'm joe namath. goodnight.
lazy bums.
"this is just a note to say, i think about you every day. and when i get you all alone..." well, it gets a little bit personal, here.
i know.
oh, here's one from my mother.
no, no. it is the sign that it is time for my arranged marriage!
no, no, no. don't you know what it means?
it all happened shortly after my eighth birthday...
oh, i cannot get married. i'm just beginning to enjoy my bachelorhood. ah, what am i going to do?!
no, no, no, no, you do not know mother. she will never quit until i am married.
no, no. i cannot lie to my mother.
yes, that is right, mother. i already got married... why did not i bother to tell you? well, uh, the reason is... well, i guess i... i didn't-think-you'd-understand. oh, got-to-go. bye-bye-bye. i love-you. love-you. it worked! it worked! the lie has set me free!!
i am sorry, you do not have enough for both.
i'm not the type to kiss and tell, sir, but listen to this...
it is my mother! oh, no! oh, no! what am i going to do?!
bu... don't you see?! she is here to meet my wife. the wife that i told her i had. i do not have a wife.
oh, she's going to be here any second! oh, yes, that'll buy me some time. homer, you've got to help me!
what?! what?! what?! what?! what?!
is it me, or do your plans always involve some horrible web of lies?
what?!
how was your day, sweetheart?
ohhhh. here i am!
ah, sorry homer, i've been planning this vacation for years. i'm finally gonna see easter island.
baloney. you came here to put me in a home.
abraham simpson. cornelius talmadge.
all right, folks, it's supper time.
supper time!
oh, yes i do.
wow, someone sure likes his kidney mush.
another bag of chips, mr. talmadge?
a respirator. it breathes for him.
you mean there?
well, i'm glad you were having fun, because i've had my hands full with apu's mother.
mother, i am so sorry. i lied to you about being married.
yeah, shut up.
oh, would you shut up.
to marge!
well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left...
"well, i'm hot blooded / check it and see / i've got a fever of a hundred and three..."
can you believe it? tradition forbids me even to speak to the woman i am about to spend my life with. hmf, has the whole world gone crazy?
your old friend apu is a lamb being led to the slaughter.
oof, i am really doomed. only the gods could stop this wedding now.
dad, those peanuts aren't for you, they're for the elephant.
got you.
but we didn't enter any police raffle.
i don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
all right, uh, simpson, homer. you're next.
ha, i hope you brought your checkbook, wise guy.
dad? why aren't you saying anything? where's our motorboat?
why would a motorboat have a mast?
hey, they can't just build a parking lot on saber tooth meadow. that's where they discovered all those fossils!
what is it? / what? / that's unbelievable. / oh, this is nice. / wow.
lisa's right! it's an angel!
oh, we can work this out, friends. in the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--
what are you doing with that?
it's probably a million years old, dad. i think it's as valuable as it's gonna get.
coming up next... an hilarious "boat giveaway" scam nets springfield's dumbest criminals!
hey-hey there, marge. just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you.
sorry to trouble you, but i'm goin' in for surgery tomorrow, and i wondered if i could rub the angel with my foot for good luck. it's foot surgery.
c'mon, homer. i just want a quick look-see. pay ya a buck...
dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. there's no proof of that.
what about that sign right there?
just let me take it to the museum for one day. they can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
you did what? / analysis? / i don't like her.
good. stay there.
hey, she's gonna smash the angel!
it's gone...
i could take up smoking.
well, it didn't ride up on no zebra.
hardly. anyone could have written that.
uhm, nah.
it's wednesday, homer.
is this all we're going to do today?
you know, homer, i'm starting to realize life is short.
we have to make the most of the time we have.
otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives.

homer! look at this mob! the good toys are probably all gone.
out?! but i just --
what happened?
i know...
what? you can't rule it out.
hey, why don't we walk over to grampa's and cheer up the old folks? that'll make us feel better.
looks like the flanders are having a nice christmas.
merry christmas, simpsons!
sounds like you're having a rough christmas, homer. you know what i blame this on the breakdown of? society.
homer, look! your house is on tv!
nah, he's right, homer.
no. my husband is... at church.
yeah, she's quite a gal.
homer! you won't believe what's happened! it's a miracle!
does anyone have change for a button?
hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours.
hey, speak for yourself.
it is now. and because of your loss, folks, i'll throw in the undercoating for two hundred -- nooo, four hundred and ninety bucks.
will this christmas never end?
slow down, homer.
no, away from the skid! hit the brakes! / floor it! / stop! / to the left! / head back!
that was close.
why you little...
stop that!
kent brockman here for a follow-up with springfield's favorite hard luck family, the simpsons! folks, any words for the christmas thief, if he's watching?
little lisa's sweater? little homer's sausage?! what in the name of holy hell is going on here?
so the family never knew about any of this.
ha.
"...you'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. sincerely, moe."
i know you're used to getting hate mail, but i'm not.
if you're headin' for the medicine cabinet, i already been there.

what did you get?
so prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of joshua logan's, "paint your wagon!"
they're gonna paint that wagon / they're gonna paint it good / they ain't braggin' / they're gonna coat that wood.
yeah, their guns are right there!
i thought it was toe-tappin' fun.
homer, you sing all the time!
you like musicals, don't you dad?
wake up dad / you're singing a song!
it's a desperate criminal / on the run from the law / please spare my children!
a singing family! it's worse than i feared / for hostage purposes / you're just too weird. / bye!
i'm back, so resume wetting your pants.
because of you all, i got a tune in my head / and the only way to stop it, is to make you all dead.
say your prayers and then it's ka-blammo! uh-oh, i'll be back when i get some ammo. / bye!
we can't even get any local laws passed / without everyone singing like a big broadway cast.
done, done.
come onnn. you have to go outside to do your... business.
i'm not going to the bathroom in the backyard.
sure we do. ding ding ding ding ding. ding ding ding ding ding...
well, well, well... looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --
oh boy! / all right, free money! / wow!
you can't go on that. you have a heart condition.
you had a quadruple bypass. you nearly died. don't you remember?

ooh, almost... rats, too hard... oh, that was close... wow, what a scam.
oh, listen pal, i gotta son of my own. here.
not so fast, pardner. you owe me some money.
at the carnival? cool!
i don't know... you gonna get drunk and start a lot of trouble?
hey, you lost your money fair and square. i didn't scam nobody.
well, in that case, let me show you how i scammed you. have a seat. spud, throw a couple more apples in the caramel. aw, now don't worry. that's just to scare off thieves.
ah, there you are. you two ready to work?
so what's our first job, huh? test the roller coaster?
ohh, this isn't fun... maybe if you didn't go to the bathroom so much, you wouldn't be so small.
all right, now this geek bit is pretty straightforward. you just bite the heads off the chickens and take a bow. go on, give it a try. and remember, big smiles.
yeah, dad?
does it matter?
dad, we're saved!
ya see, the trick here is, the rings won't fit over the good prizes.
well, we gotta git. here's the money box. uh, any questions?
good move.
lookie, lookie, hey, hey, wocka, wocka! i got rings and you want 'em! win a genuine ronex watch. just like a real moogie star!
we're natural born carnies, dad. if only we weren't tied down with a family...
ah, i hate to interrupt your fun, boys... but i got a few complaints that your game is crooked.
gee, i'd hate to close you down. maybe we can reach a little, ah, "understanding" here...
um, hey, dad, i, i think he wants a...
uh, let me put it this way. i'm looking for my friend "bill." have you seen any "bills" around here?
listen carefully and watch me wink as i speak. okay?
the guy i'm really looking for, wink, is mr. "bribe," wink, wink.
all right, that's it. i'm shutting this game down.
oh, good lord. our whole life was in that trailer. what are we gonna do now?
did-ja call me, spud? 
i'm goin' for a corn dog. you want one?
how long are those roustabouts going to be staying here?
ooo, what a nice surprise! this is so generous of you, cooder.
what's going on?
they're squatting in our house?
well, well, look who's here. mr. no bribe. sure, we'll help ya. just sit down and wait for detective like-i-give-a-damn.
that urkle's a hoot.
homer!
homer!!
no fires!
there must be a way to outsmart them.
yeah, i'm listenin'.
so we'd own the house legit?
oh, i can't watch.
way to go, dad. you actually outwitted someone.
homer...
thanks for lettin' me skip school to see the team come back from the championship, dad.
have you heard of krishna consciousness?
do unto others as you would have them do unto you!
a new and better life awaits you on our distant home planet, blisstonia.
we're having a free get-acquainted session at our resort this weekend.
it's free.
it's this weekend.
um, it's free.
it's this weekend.
c'mon, dad! the team's arriving!
but what if they try to talk us into something?
you bought four of them. thank god the check bounced.
watch yourself, dad. you're the highly suggestible type.
welcome, brother!
hi, how are y--
it certainly is a beautiful day. we should thank the leader.
why don't you come chat with us about the leader at the welcome center.
beer is not allowed.
would you rather have beer or complete and utter contentment?
the leader knows how miserable you, marge, lisa, bart and maggie are.
just come up and watch our orientation film. you're free to leave at anytime.
and your stink brings tears to my eyes!
the leader is perfect!
what are you talking about? there's nothing like that in there.
but our point is very simple. you see when --
yeah, lose some weight! / amen you're fat / moron-type
you've failed at everything you've ever tried.
it doesn't wear down your resistance if you eat a whole month's supply. he even ate mine!
or... na na na na na na na na leader / na na na na na na na na leader....
you what?!
you what?!
we what?
i can't go along with this, homer.
dad, do you think you might have been brainwashed?
homer!
oh, yes you are. i'm afraid it's our home now. this house will become the new local welcome center for this district.
homer simpson, your family will be housed here for the first 100,000 years. then something might open up in a double.
yeah, maybe it'll wear off. like his interest in c.b. radio.
the leader! / he's coming! / the leader is coming! / the leader! / etc.
we toil in the fields and he rides around in a rolls royce?
oh, look who the new pet is!
this is ridiculous, we're already married!
yaaay! here comes the leader!
all right, now, what's so all-fired great about your fancy-pants leader?
eww, well, that is impressive.
uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? anyone like a draft beer?
homer, you don't have to go with them!
he's our husband now.
hallelujah!
homer simpson! because of your lack of faith, you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation!
whoa, cool! god is so in-your-face.
oh, all right. you can stay up late tonight. but tomorrow everyone's going to bed at five o'clock.
aw, those poor badgers are soaked.
oh my goodness! that was a long movie! it's time for school! let's go! let's go!
oops! that's for me. flancrest enterprises is my home business.
no-ho-ho, it's true! maude and i sell religious hook rugs over the internet.
yes indeedy. makin' some good scratch, too.
yep.
homer, what are you doing?
what business enterprise?
internet, eh?
is that my good butter?
what exactly is it your company does again?
how about compuglobal hypermeganet?
i'm interested in upgrading my 28.8 kilobaud internet connection to a 1.5-megabit fiber-optic t1 line. will you be able to provide an ip router that's compatible with my token-ring ethernet lan configuration?
homer, bill gates is here.
mr. simpson?
don't let the haircut fool you. i'm exceedingly wealthy.
your internet ad was brought to my attention. but i can't figure out what, if anything, compuglobal hypermeganet does. so rather than risk competing with you, i've decided simply to buy you out.
homer, quiet. you'll queer the deal.
well, everyone always does. "buy him out," boys!
what do we need church shoes for? jesus wore sandals.
look, homer. there's that bird you like to argue with.
hey, if you didn't wanna tie shoes, you shouldn't a become a shoe salesman.
excuse me, sir? do you like to laugh?
well, then you'll love our comedy festival. it's for a good cause.
no, dad, it's to fight soil erosion.
i finally got around to reading the dictionary. turns out the zebra did it.
dad, the zebra didn't do it. it's just a word at the end of the dictionary.
it's just a joke.
plus, i got this new boyfriend. and you know how it is when you're kissing a guy with a tongue stud...
dad!
thank you. thank you. and now, the all new comedy stylings of... krrrusty the clown...
i see. uhh... what about 2 cent stamps?... pizza pie's very hot these days, uh... can't open pickle jars, no mail on sunday... out of paper towels... oh! oh! oh! what's the deal with cardboard?...
me too...
four drink minimum?
yeah, yeah, yeah. so, i'm watchin' tv today...
yeah! / right on, krusty! / you tell 'em!
it's my allowance, mother, and i'll burn it the way i want.
dad!
oh, knock it off, homer. you're the fattest one in the car...
i brought a bag of money in case he wants us to burn it again.
oooo! / what did you do? /
ow! bart, that has nuts in it!
yeah, mom says a lot of things.
actually, we can't take a bath anyway. the water heater is broken.
what on earth -- ?!
yeah. big deal. you got a wife. i got a rash. who cares? ech, i'm sorry, homer. it's just, it's been four years since my last date with a whatchacallit, uh, woman.
ah, she got homesick for her old life, diving for tourist pennies in a micronesian swamp.
yeah, i don't blame her. no girl wants to end up with a joe puke-pail like me.
yeah, well, uh, how come i ain't fendin' off movie starlets with a pointy stick?
ah, i don't know, homer. women can smell panic. and, uh, right now, i gotta be reekin' of it.
it's all yours.
no, i'm in love with you.
i like a face with character.
who cares? you're goin' out with me. she's going out with me, cat!
so, renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to moe. do you mind if i ask why?
but he's really grown on me. he's got this insecure, sweaty charm.
shut up, or i'll ram a stool down your throat! ah, nah, nah, no, i don't want that on the card... well, lemme hear how it sounds... nah, nah, take it out. take it out. and charge it to my players club card... maxed out? look, i really need these flowers, okay? i got a real tenuous hold on my girlfriend here... hello? hello? well, that's it. it's all over. renee ain't gonna wanna hang around with no joe pinchpenny.
hmmm... i need cash, and lots of it. um, all right, everybody, i'm calling in your bar tabs. ya bunch of ungrateful ingrates! ya-- ah, homer, what am i gonna do? renee's my last chance for true love.
nah, my car ain't worth nothin'. but it is insured... for five grand... homer, i need your help. you gotta steal this car and wreck it for me.
c'mon, homer! i'm one of your dearest friends! when everybody said you were too drunk to drive that time, who gave you your keys?
homer, i insist you steal that car.
okay, here's the plan. this model car represents my car, huh? and this olive is you. now...
hey! hey! aw, that's great. now the car's gonna have to represent you, and, uh, this little toy man will represent the car. all right, forget it! listen up, here. tomorrow night at eight, you go down to the waterfront and you "steal" my car.
that's the beauty part. every cop in town's gonna be on the police department's moonlight charity cruise. and i'm gonna be right there with 'em.
righ-- no, no. wrong. listen. while i'm on the boat with the perfect alibi, you steal my car, and park it on the railroad tracks. then when the 10:15 train comes along... wham! the insurance company pays off five thousand clams. i keep showing renee the sweet life.
why all the black?
you look a little nervous, dad.
you're up to something, aren't you?
get off me, mr. president!
homer, did you really steal a car?
dad, we're the visitors.
i'd like to believe you...
well, dad, in the meantime, here's a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff.
three.
pssst. homer. homer. wake up.
yeah, congratulations, homer. the plan worked perfectly.
yeah, yeah, that's, that's a kick in the pants.
yeah, i wish i could, homer, but if i change my story, they're gonna throw me in here.
ohh, cripes, the puppy-dog look. all right, all right. i'll use the money to bail you out.
ten minutes till fresh air and exercise.
hawaii, here we come! "i nanakuli makou 'ai ana o na uluwahi hawaii!"
hey! stop saying hawaii in there!
would you care for some reading material?
homer! thank god, you gotta help me here!
eh! that's it! you're going down, pal! oh, boy... uh, i really wanna sleep...
oh, homer, i been the world's biggest rat. can you ever forgive me?
aww! ah, my poor bar. it's all gone.
kids, from now on, i don't want you touching anything in our house. dart!
more comin'.
you'll have it in forty-five seconds, sir.
to pass the time, please enjoy this novelty pen.
look at this mess! where is that elderly old man? old man? old ma...
wait a minute... there is a note!
hey, lis. wanna join us?
yeah... huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!
and now a channel 6 editorial reply...
whuh? 
i don't want to turn out that way!
lisa! come on! your tomato soup is getting a skin on top!
i'm getting worried about lisa. she's been gone for hours.
i'm supposed to talk to you about proposition 305...
beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. you can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower...
homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!
little girl -- likes her brain. what's your opinion?
i run an unsuccessful shrimp company.
oh, yeah.
uh, i shoot birds at the airport.
you probably should've researched this first, eh, dad?
my legs hurt.
what about our five bucks?
wait a minute, homer! you didn't ask everybody. what about the women?
so i'm not doomed! oh dad, i've never been happier to be your daughter.
so, wait a minute. this means i'm gonna be a failure?
me. i smell a museum.
welcome to the knowledgeum! i'm troy mcclure. you may remember me from such automated information kiosks as "welcome to springfield airport" and "where's nordstrom?" while you're enjoying our hall of wonders, your car will unfortunately be subject to repeated break-ins...
i wanna read the giant book!
help! she's touching my special area!
all right, all right, now. you're over-stimulated. let's get some beer in you, and then it's right to bed.
but people will see me paired up with a doofus. you have no idea what that's like.
nnno, that stinks. let me try one. "this is geraldine, and the devil made me miss your call. so, here come de beep. here come de beep."
ohh, i found something all right.
but asking you was ralph's idea.
as homer's defense attorney i feel we should be merciful-- hey! did you just take a bite out of me?
homer, wake up! it's time for our coffee break.
yeah and you drooled all over it, ya--
uh, sir, we've found the problem. some idiot threw this in the reactor core.
you did this? how could you be so irresponsible?
oh, really? why did you think you could lie to me?
next, on exploitation theater: "blackula," followed by "blackenstein." and the "blunch black of blotre blame."
daybreak. jakarta. the proud men and women of the navy are fighting for freedom. but you're in lubbock, texas, hosing stains off a monument. you're in the naval reserve. america's seventeenth line of defense, between the mississippi national guard and the league of women voters. after basic training you'll only have to work one weekend a month. and most of that time you're drunk off your ass!
are you thinking of joining the naval reserve?
eh, sort of.
just fill out this form and you're on your way to the reserve.
well, due to a recent presidential order, we're not allowed to ask that particular question.
for god's sake, don't answer that! i could go to jail!
la la la la la la la! i am not listening! la la la la la la la la!
homie, i really don't think this navy thing is a good idea. what if you get called into combat?
we don't have a clapper.
and although my religion strictly forbids military service -- what the hey, i'm in too.
good luck, dad. although i am morally opposed to the military-industrial complex of which you are now a part.
hey, homer, bring me back a torpedo.
but flanders got his kids torpedoes.
homer!
tuck in that shirt -- shine those shoes, mister -- oh, for the love of --
all right, simpson. i don't like you and you don't like me --
um, all right. you like me, but i don't like you!
what are you, a comedian?
very nice, simpson. but next time tie the other end to the ship!
permission granted.
and another thing! when people come up to me and say "hey, little buddy," and hit me over the head with a hat - that's not funny! that hurts! stop laughing at me!
i'm so proud of you, homie.
hello everybody. sparkle sparkle.
milhouse jumped off a cliff? i'm there!
well, i'm keeping this earring and you can't stop me!
can i?
next weekend we're having our annual war games. now simpson, because of your many years as a nuclear technician we're putting you on a nuclear sub.
be careful, dad.
are you sure you'll be okay?
come on, dad. didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?
i'm a man of few words! any questions?
i like the cut of your jib.
homer! join us.
tell me, young man. what do you want out of life?
we all want peace. but it's always just out of reach.
so what's the best way to get peace?
exactly. not with the olive branch but the bayonet. ah simpson, you're like the son i never had.
i'll take care of it. oh, what the hell -- simpson, while i'm gone, you're in command.
homer, we've got an enemy sub closing in fast. what do we do?
fifteen seconds to collision. we need a decision!
don't fire the torpedoes.
we're losin' power! we're losing back-up power!
that means you're in charge, homer.
those were the orders.
sonar, out. navigation, out. radio, out.
ice-blended mocha drinks and david schwimmer.
captain, how are we supposed to get home with no equipment?
aye, aye, captain. setting course for rigel 7... i mean, home.
mayday! mayday! the engine room has sprung a leak! it's filling up with a clear, non-alcoholic liquid.
yeah, that's it. we've got a pinhole leak and there's no way to plug it!
sparkle sparkle!
dad, the earring could plug the hole.
you saved us, homer.
attention, homer simpson! you have ten seconds to explain your actions before we open fire!
i think you're off the hook.
a dishonorable discharge! it's the best we could've hoped for.
i think you're a hero, dad.
then can i get a tattoo that says, "bite me?" you never know when it might come in handy.
a king cobra?
weapons-grade plutonium?
knock-out drops?
ninja death stars?
ten!... nine!... eight!... eight-eight-eight...
dad!
that was last year's taxes! you have to pay again this year!
i put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!
homer, you know we don't have...
homer, i painted that for you.
what about you, homer?
homer simpson? united states government.
mr. simpson, this government computer can process over nine tax returns per day. did you really think you could fool it?
you're looking at five years, minimum.
you won't be seeing any prison movies where you're going... prison!
anything? well, that's a start. agent johnson, fbi.
from now on you're gonna work for us.
they want you to spy on your friends?
the government has no right to use you this way.
there you go, ratboy.
no, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression.
oh, god!
you sayin' you want to commit a crime, homer?
or that telemarketing scam you pulled?
oh, you, you mean like the time barney beat up george bush.
hey, how did they finger charlie? somebody musta ratted him out.
my superiors were pleased with your work. you have a flair for treachery.
ohh, you're not through, simpson. we have a high-risk assignment for you.
let's take a walk.
good morning, agent johnson. the film you are about to see is top secret and contains adult situations. in 1945, the people of europe struggled to rebuild following the war.
to make good on this drunken boast, truman authorized the one-time printing of the largest denomination currency ever: a trillion-dollar bill.
sometimes i don't know why i bother.
now what, smithers? i... you're not smithers.
employee, eh? what a pleasant surprise. hmm... a pack of vicious dogs should be ripping you to pieces...
very well, come on in. perhaps i have something i can scald you with. it'll, uh, be a few minutes. so, what brings you to my home?
ya! ha!
hmm. well, let me get you a towel.
what is this? what are you doing?
oh, i get it. i'm on to you. you're from collier's magazine, aren't you? are you going to put me in star snoop?
i hope you don't mind a little walking. well, of course, i didn't want a racehorse in my living room, but you don't say no to spring byington, do you?
heh, heh, heh. heh, heh. ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit charlie chaplin was buried in.
here's a scoop for your readers: the hall of patriots. that intrepid lad is my great grandfather! franklin jefferson burns. tossing that tea without a care for what the caffeine would do to the fenway flounder.
it was.
let's move.
well, that would be pretty careless of me, wouldn't it? i keep the real bill right here.
i'm not the thief, the government is. every year you make hard-working joes like my reporter friend here pay income taxes, and for what? aid to ungrateful foreigners, do-nothing nuclear missiles, tomb polish for some unknown soldier...
ohh, you can silence me, but you can't silence collier's magazine! tell the people! don't let the government push you around! you have a choice! fight back!
faster, simpson! those jack-booted g-men won't be far behind.
that really was more of a burgundy...
capital idea! let's blow this fascist popsicle stand. we'll purchase a small island somewhere and start our own country, free from the relentless tyranny of uncle sam.
attention fugitives. you are leaving u.s. jurisdiction. turn back immediately or we will be unable to prosecute you.
no, wait! we're now over international waters.
any of these islands would make a fine new country.
es carne de burro.
so, you say batista's gone? did you know that?
please, we are all amigos here.
well, if it's a crime to love one's country, then i'm guilty. and if it's a crime to steal a trillion dollars from our government and hand it over to communist cuba, then i'm guilty of that, too. and if it's a crime to bribe a jury, then so help me, i'll soon be guilty of that!
do not be alarmed. that is just my helper monkey, sir. i got him after a robber shot me six times and left me for dead.
ah, they serve as seeing eyes for the blind, sir.
no.
ahh, may i inquire as to how you are "differently abled"?
uh, sir, helper monkeys are only for the physically challenged or enfeebled.
oh, son, this monkey's gonna change my life.
monkey! there's a monkey in the house!
why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
and now... "kids news."
hmf. the monkey's on my part of the sofa.
excellent.
you already have a monkey.
hmm. it really makes you think.
i want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.
come on, mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money.
i'm sir loves-a-lot, the bear who loves to love!
it's the same basic bear, homey.
it's a "kisses-make-me-boogie-o-lantern." kiss it and make it boogie!
uh, maybe later.
uh, what a terrible waste!
yep, that's the rule. he who tops it off, drops it off.
i heard that! you know the rule.
what did you call us?
didn't you learn anything from love day?
oh lord! now what are we going to do? just let the trash pile up?
dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?
see you in hell, brussel sprouts.
easy, ned, don't breathe in. oooooh!
uh, listen homer, ah, hate to be a fussy freddy and all, but maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors...
three, two, one... go! go! go!
homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again.
yeah dad, you're always telling me and bart to apologize.
i think you're startin' to crack.
no way.
oh homer, you didn't beat city hall! they picked up our trash because i wrote a letter of apology to the sanitation commissioner and signed your name. period.
you've signed my name lots of times.
yes.
here's your apology back, mr. simpson, and i'm sorry we couldn't work this out.
i'm not tryin' to scare you. i'm just tryin' to get my work done, here.
what cameras? why are you still here?
hey, stop that!
leave the bird alone!
look simpson, i've been elected by the voters of this city sixteen years in a row, so they must think i'm doing a damn good job.
no! nobody wants to hear the nonsensical ravings of a loud-mouthed malcontent!
hey, everybody, vote for my dad, homer simpson. if you don't he'll beat us.
so, homer, if we vote for you, whaddaya gonna do different?
yea, i know. it's a peace of mind issue you know?
whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa! can i help you?
okay, camera two... uh, excuse me, this is a restricted area.
what the bloody hell?
why should they vote for you?
ah, gee, you're kinda all over the place there, homer. you need to focus here. you gotta think hard and come up with a slogan that appeals to all the lazy slobs out there.
can't someone else do it? that's perfect!
yeah. now get out there and spread that message to the people!
whoa, whoa, hey, you didn't pay for the beer.
i would deem it excellent.
oh man, you got that right. / yeah. / i guess so. / it's so annoying in the morning/ yes. / uh-huh.
i'll say.
hey, yeah!
yeah! / someone else! / someone else! / yeah!
yeah!
sorry i'm late, everyone. somebody tampered with my brakes.
oh, c'mon, people. this man has promised round the clock trash pick-up. that's impossible!
i can't believe what i'm hearing!
pops? i'm only two years older than you!
what button? what the hell are you talkin' about?!
all right, fine. if you want an experienced public servant, vote for me. but if you wanna believe a bunch of crazy promises about garbage men cleaning your gutters and waxing your car -- then by all means, vote for this sleazy lunatic.
aren't you gonna buy it, dad?
if i hadn't already packed my letter opener, i'd give you such a stabbing...
friendship? you told people i lure children into my gingerbread house.
simpson, the american people have never tolerated incompetence in their public officials. you are going to crash and burn, my fat-headed friend.
wow, dad, you're really working hard.
i'm really proud of you, homie, but can the garbage man really do all the things you said?
simpson, you idiot, you spent your entire year's budget in a month. your department's broke.
how could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?
you know dad, there's a lesson in all this. many cities have problems with garbage disposal, and it's time we realized you can't just...
my men ain't workin' another minute till we get paid.
i'll have to say drugs, too.
good god, homer! you're turning our wonderful little town into america's trash-hole.
but dad, you can't cram garbage under springfield forever.
i don't know how you did it, homer, but you certainly solved that budget crisis. what the hell is that?
and all those opposed to horse-whipping homer simpson?
i can't believe it's come to this.
moving the whole town five miles down the road! it's crazy!
so we transplant the town. we're just gonna trash the new springfield, too.
wowwww! mcbain has really buffed up. you could grate cheese on those abs.
anyway, it's time for the church picnic.
no they didn't. you just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
aw nuts!
nice to see you, homer.
yeah, well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. i pick my dad. oh, you'd be surprised. he gets pretty competitive when he's drinking. c'mon, dad. we're playing capture the flag!
but rod picked his dad. it's a matter of family honor.
okay, dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good...
no, wait. i have a plan. but i'll need your underpants.
get him!
tag tag tag tag tag!
oh, i don't think he can get up. let's egg him!
me? i'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
whatever you say, sweetie.
so what will it be, mr. simpson? your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies?
oh, well, we have some low-salt candy bars and some reduced-fat soda. and our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free.
oh yes, that is a new item. no bar contains more applesauce.
excuse me. you're doing this station all backwards. let me show you how to do it like a man.
hey, hey, hey. that's enough. now step over to the abdominator and i will shout slogans at you. push! harder! go past the max! reach over the top! master your ass!
and your shirt!
oh my goodness gracious!
i've got some!
whoaa...
my casserole is not filth. eat it.
now that's just non--
homer, stop insulting us and eat your filth. food. i mean, food.
you know rainier wolfcastle?
my dad could do it! he eats fifty dollars' worth of power sauce bars a day.
hm. congratulations, sir.
you're gonna be the first man to climb the murderhorn.
son! don't go up that mountain! you'll die up there! just like i did!
sure, it was the winter of '28... the butter baby flapjack company sponsored me and a fella named mcallister. we were almost to the top, when we ran low on supplies. heroically, i gave him the last short stack. then, that glory hog took all the supplies and headed for the top alone. i fell 8,000 feet onto a pile of jagged rocks. 'course folks were tougher in those days. i was jitterbuggin' that very night. but that skunk mcallister was never seen again.
and when he reaches the top, mr. simpson, here, will plant this power sauce flag as an eternal symbol of man's contempt for nature. wait -- is "contempt" the word i want here? homer, you're the world's greatest hero. do you owe it all to power sauce?
dad, wait. you're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?
uh, dad? shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher?
frankly we don't care.
then technically, shouldn't you go back down the mountain and start all over?
are you crazy? you'll never make it.
homer, listen to me! turn back now!
oh, homie! you're alive!
didja make it to the top, dad? huh? didja?
all i see is a pole. maybe the flag fell off.
forget about it, homer. you made it to the top. you're the coolest dad ever.
'mornin' boys. can't stop to chat. time is money.
hey dad, wake up.
dad?
it's lisa. i just called to tell you how much i love you and can i take the bus to the museum?
ahm... i wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. she said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get bart to the emergency room.
well... if it would put your mind at ease, i could take a limousine. although that would cost two hundred dollars...
hmm. i guess i could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea.
oh, all right.
oh, what, this thing? i got it down at the museum. it's what the ancient egyptians call a "souvenir."
alone?
that never, uhh, happened, did it, homer?
but--
shouldn't you be at work right now?
well then, get back to wherever it is you work, whoever you are.
excuse me, ma'am? uh, hello? somebody? anybody?
dad!
look out!
dad, grab onto it!
are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? i mean, a drawbridge did close on your head.
i should have known i wasn't old enough to take the bus alone, but i really wanted to see that exhibit. i'll never take another stupid risk like that again!
what?
i guess...
dad! you're headed for the river again!
dad, are you all right?
see the isis exhibit. but the museum's closed.
dad, i'm kind of scared.
okay... here goes.
wowww. it's magnificent. now i know how sir dudley winthrop felt when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the temple of isis. have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?
ohmigosh! it's the mysterious orb of isis. archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means.
oh! we can't touch it, dad. it's behind a velvet rope! a velvet rope.
dad! you broke it! it's a music box! dad, we uncovered the secret!
it's so beautiful. and just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years. thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, dad.
it's kind of humbling, isn't it? the music we just heard might never be heard again.
dad, that's the old spice song.
do do do do-do / do do do do-do / do do do do do do do do.
and look as handsome as the day we were married.
you mean frank grimes?
yayyy!
well, maybe our next anniversary will be more romantic. ohhh, look, homie. our wedding cake.
look at this little plastic couple. mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future...
i'm going to bed.
good night, homie.
yeah, we probably should... you know... rock the casbah.
oh. oh, did you want me to...?
no, no, no, i have my part in this, too, um...
homie, you got your, your elbow in...
mmm.
ooh! ooh! ooh! ooh! sorry! sorry! sorry! do you want me to?
well, we used to...
ooh! who's a good boy?
oh yes he is! yes he is!
oh, yeah. he's really special.
i love him, too. g'night.
homer, don't look.
someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. we can get a new one.
when we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our saturdays? driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?
ooh. there's the turn!
safe at last.
if somebody's in here, you're in for some serious ass-forkin'. huh. well, maybe they're in the media room.
ohhh. my hero.
he put new electrical tape on the cushions.
can i come?
oh, isn't it romantic? doilies and cozies as far as the eye can see.
should we get started?
hm, something's not right. does this bed feel lumpy to you?
oh, my heart's beating like crazy.
y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on.
shh! they'll hear us.
exactly. now there's nothing left out there but treasure.
hey, you're back. did you rock the casbah?
it's okay when you're in love. and married. to the sweetest guy in the world.
you don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?
oh, this is so naughty. coming back to our old love nest...
oh, we drank so much that night.
heh, heh. yeah.
we're trapped!
who cares what it is? let's monoxide it.
we've gotta get home before someone sees us.
all right, men, those nudies are here somewhere. fan out.
but think of the scandal.
clothes! we're saved!
you mean this thing?
hang on, homie. i'm gonna try to set her down.
dear lord, look at that blimp. he's hanging from a balloon.
kids, i want to explain about the stadium. y'see, sometimes moms and dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other.
so they need to explore new ways to express their love.
all those eyes, just leering and leering at us.
look, dad, they've got every kind of paper! looseleaf, graph, unlined, college-ruled!
yes, sir! one kwik-e-dog, one bubble gum cigar, and the latest issue of "success" magazine.
yes, i just cleaned out the machine, sir, so the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease.
i'm so sorry, but i sold it all to the rendering plant.
oh yes. they use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby food...
uh, dad, i don't think the dog can handle any more bacon.
homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight.
with cans of grease?
come on, bart. the bus is here.
it's the first day of school.
four pounds of grease... that comes tooo... sixty-three cents.
dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars.
but doesn't she get her money from you?
um, i don't know how much more school i can miss.
they only like her 'cause she acts so grown up, with her perfume and her cell phone and... oh, and get this, mom, she drinks iced tea.
but, dad...
when you want grease, go to the source: good old krusty burger.
i was thinking more of the deep fryer.
can i help you, sir?
mom's gonna kill you.
we run the grease racket in this town.
my poor homie. couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
hey, dad, i've been thinking. what if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?
dad, he's not stupid.
don't worry. this is the score we've been dreamin' about. the grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.
where's the hose?
are you as excited as i am?
eek! -- i mean, ach! -- i mean, what are you doing here?
saints be praised! i'm from scotland! where do ye hail from?
no foolin'?! i'm from north kilt-town! do you know angus maccloud?
not so fast, boy-o. well, if it was up to me, i'd let ya go. but the lads have a temper... and they've been drinkin' all day.
uh... guys? guys? the hose.
hey, luigi bringa you kids free pizza. why you have to maka da fun, huh?
doctors say the life expectancy of the average man is now seventy-six point two years.
sir, do you need a tow truck?
oh, honey, don't eat that. wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag?
indubitably, old chum.
okay, but you've accomplished a lot. you've made me very happy.
hi, dad. how was work?
come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt. surprise!
the kids and i want to show you all the great things you've done.
there you are in outer space. that's pretty impressive.
remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children.
your family has asked me to take time out from my busy schedule to invite you to a very speciallll...
that, too. he also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car.
it's true. i read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
top of the world, ma!
dad? what are you doin' here?
that's great, dad.
they're all about smugglers.
excuse me, are you a student at this school?
that doesn't sound like me. well, i suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant.
huh? oh... uh... oh, nuts. i forgot. all i can think of now is edison. i can't even remember where i work.
uh, james watt invented the steam engine.
all right, already! everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison!
well, you're not thomas edison.
whatever.
do us a favor. invent yourself some underpants.
i didn't tell you to quit your job.
something electrical might be good.
oh?
homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer.
you've started smoking, dad?
yeah. he invented stuff, too.
butt.
booger.
homer! you can't punish the children just because you can't come up with an idea.
hm. i brought you a tuna sandwich. they say it's brain food. i guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are.
and these should give you the grounding you'll need in thermodynamics, hyper-mathematics, and of course microcalifragilistics.
well, all you have to do is think of things that people need, but which don't exist yet.
possibleh. or you could take something that already exists and find a new use for it, like--
uh, well, well... i suppose that... would... qualify, uh...
i will buy ten of those right now.
turn it off, homer.
homer, you've got it set on "whore."
dad, women won't like being shot in the face.
you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?
no, bart. homer... all these inventions, they're...
they're not very...
they're terrible.
i'm not saying you're a bad inventor. i'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. or accept them as gifts.
do you mind?
homer! / dad! / look out!
it could save lives!
me, too!
hey, dad, heard you swearing. mind if i join in? crap. boobs. crap.
if edison thought of that chair, how come it's not on this chart?
so?
but i thought you loved edison.
yeah! hell, damn, fart!
man, i can't wait to smash that chair.
ohh! / well, now that i'd like to see. / yes.
your electric hammer, maestro?
you mean the wild mood swings?
can i?
uh, i think that's in italy, dad.
...authorities say the phony pope can be recognized by his high-top sneakers and incredibly foul mouth. in other news, thomas edison, the greatest inventor of all time...is apparently still inventing, despite the notable handicap of being dead.
i gotta admit, homer. you're taking this pretty well.
that's me!
one stinkin' letter? why'd you make us gather 'round like that?
yeah, lis. she is a smart, sophisticated woman. now let's hear more about that big, big reward.
cram it, ma'am.
uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?
while i deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?
that's your underwear.
he's up in his room. bart?
no, no. i'm pretty sure he's with milhouse.
what?
i think he's at nelson's!
nelson?! i explicitly forbade bart from playing with that little monster. ooo, bart is in deep, deep trouble. oh, yes. and punish lisa for lying to us.
mmm. what do you think he's doing up there?
drug lab?!
that never happened, dad.
hmm... it's starting to cool down. i'll bake another pie.
actually, it took fifty-three hours.
i see a neck!
man, those are some funky-lookin' birds.
you're a lizard.
dibs on the liver!
boy, you're getting this transplant just in time, homer. this is genuine human hair.
ooooh-woo! wow. if your fly weren't open, you'd look just like roger moore.
ooh. ooo-la-la simp-son. huh. what can i do for you and your new do?
snake? but you're dead.
... and the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. on a lighter note, a kwik-e-mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.
ah, morning, homer. ah, you're looking unusually focused this morning.
well, somebody's a grumpy gus. what's-- 
don't you get it? he swore he'd kill me too. i'm next!
dad?
nooo!
my school picture!!
you've got to fight the hair, dad!
i love you too, dad. get off of me.
ow! that's my face, you idiot!
homer simpson, you're under arrest for the murders of moe szyslak and apu nahasa -- pasa -- uh, just moe, just moe.
oh, homer, you're not going as a hobo again?
well, we're leaving. and remember, no itchy and scratchy. i better take these batteries just to be sure.
look! dad, you gotta get us out of here! use the remote!
she's teething. look... her very first baby tooth.
oh, geez!
me too.
homer, do something! the ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!
we'll return with "how dracula got his groove back."
oh, lord. i was hoping this day would never come.
i guess i've been in denial. homer... kang is maggie's father.
and now she must return home to rigel 7, where she will be guaranteed a lucrative civil service job for life.
okay, we're back. homer, how did it feel to learn your baby was fathered by a drooling space octopus?
well, you're about to get a whole lot angrier... because we have the extramarital extraterrestrial backstage in a soundproof booth where he can't hear us.
suckers.
dad! wake up! wake up! wake up!
yeah, yeah. anyway, you promised to take us to the lake.
actually, keeping promises would make you a good father.
yes, we'll go to the darn lake! now go back to bed. it's four a.m.!
homer, your spine!
whooa!
stop calling everyone suckers!
tree!
this is such a secluded area. i wonder who lives in that house?
hey, here come the simpsons. n-now be careful, homer. there's a fella in the sand right in front of ya...
there you go. and i assume you've read the boat safety manual.
uh sir, you can't operate a boat under the influence of alcohol.
check.
secure.
ready.
she's down.
i don't know... i think dad might be a little heavy for parasailing.
step on it, mom. dad's signaling that he wants to go higher.
it won't go any --
there goes my turn.
what the hell?!
it's basinger.
thanks. listen, you think you could slide over a little?
i'm alec baldwin. could you get off me?
well...
are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital, mr. simpson? you had an awful lot of glass in you.
hm, sometimes we need to get away from hollywood. l.a. is just so phony.
what we really like here is the privacy. most people don't even know where springfield is.
no more muffins.
yeah, i'm not sure we need an assistant, mr. simpson.
i suppose we could give it a try.
will you promise to keep our secret?
okay, what is it?
but you just read that card from the gersh agency.
we've been looking all over for you, dad. where did you land?
where'd you get that muffin?
yes.
right.
uh-huh.
mister simpson, these exotic items are suspiciously different from your usual order of beer and pork. what gives?
when you win one, you can take care of it however you want.
hi, i'm ron howard.
yeah, i'm lookin' for alec baldwin and kim basinger.
oh, that's just homer. he's a new friend of ours.
do i smell vodka... and wheat grass?
ooh, i'll have one of those, too. hey, can i crash here tonight?
a cell phone? last thursday's "variety"?
oh, they don't come much bigger than that.
but that's not what p.e.t.a. stands--
homer, i'm feeling some sharp pains in my neck.
um, does anybody know where this came from?
on my pillow.
i am not!
no, i didn't!
i did not!
yeah, homer, um, most movie scripts are 120 pages. this is only seventeen. annnd several of the pages are just drawings of the time machine.
i'm sorry, homer.
oh, what? i suppose you've seen a bigger star?
come on, make with a name.
tell the people, homer. they have a right to know about the celebrity summer house.
what do you care? i'm telling you what you want to hear.
yess! in your freckled face, howard!
what?
my god. the lemonade. look at the lemonade!
somebody must have told them we live here.
homer, how could you?
homer, you betrayed our confidence. i just don't think we can be friends anymore.
anywhere but here.
homer, you haven't touched your food.
alec baldwin, wow. that is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. what was it like at their house?
i washed the dog today.
of course not.
ankle? "foccacia"? what are you talking about?
don't blame us, dad. the celebrities are the ones who canned you.
i never get tired of that.
hey, it's alec baldwin's medic-alert bracelet.
we love celebrities!
i'm really looking forward to seeing homer again. he always has the most interesting odors.
what the -- ?
pull over, you maniac!
not well. but i'll give it a shot.
you killed ron howard!
mr. simpson, do you have anything to say for yourself?
woo hoo!
worthless old geezers.
i'll say.
or begging. i know a place that'll saw your legs off...
now you're dreaming.
of course. nuclear power.
really?
nuclear power.
hey!
i didn't quite get the point of it, dad. why would lenny want someone to saw his legs off?
didn't seem like anybody even read the script.
you're joining the screen actor's guild?
fat guy number three?
hey, what the heck is your middle name, anyway?
how should i know? it was your mother's job to name ya and love ya and such. i was mainly in it for the spanking.
you might as well. you already made up a phony film credit.
you lied dozens of times on our mortgage application.
hmm... i know where we might find your missing moniker. it's a bit of a drive, but on the way we can have a nice father son chat.
this is the hippie commune your mother ran off to when life with me became a living hell.
is that... abe simpson? geez, man, we haven't seen you since woodstock.
oh, homer j., how do you keep your hair so rich and full?
homer j., will you teach us to make love?
aaanyway, i-i still think about her every time i walk by that mural she painted.
she also left her old poncho.
all right, we got what we came for, plus that stink rag to boot. now, let's hit the road. just lyin' around... never workin'... without a care in...
whuh?
now i know how dean rusk feels. g'night everybody!
dad, do you mind? your feet are really close to my potato.
homer, excuse yourself.
you know, i really don't appreciate being called a narc. and that poncho is filthy! let me dry-clean it for you.
ew! help! oh, i've never seen anything like... my eyes have been soiled!
homer, for god sakes, put your poncho on!
my man! you've gone granola.
join the hack.
okay, time to get back to work.
we grow our own vegetables and process them right here. and we give half the profits to war orphans.
w-we're just trying to pay the bills, homer. i mean, we're still hippies at heart.
wait. don't you work for a nuclear power plant?
i drive a saturn.
yeah, an old-time freak-out sounds tempting, homer. but we've got a big order to fill.
hey, we'll call it a business trip and write off the mileage.
thanks for the tip, homer.
weirdos!
oh, lord.
uh, it's that pair of dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?
oh, please god, don't let them come in here.
that was fun. i don't know if we actually freaked anyone out, but --
our entire shipment is ruined!
the only people who are going be freaked out are our stockholders.
there won't be any more freak-outs! you're not a hippie, and you never were!
ooh, does this mean you're going to start showering again?
aw, cheer up, dad. you make a great hippie.
and the soles of your feet are jet black.
i know you feel bad about the juice incident, but i'm sure you can make up for it somehow.
w-what happened to our crops?
but there weren't enough vegetables left to fill that order.
homer, those were our "personal vegetables."
officer, please, we can explain...
oh, for the love of... there. now, let's crack some skulls.
forget the clubs. just shoot him.
i'm a doctor, not a gardener.
... and may we burn in painful and foul-smelling fire forever and ever. aaaaa-- mmmennnn...onite minister will be giving a guest sermon next sunday. go in peace. aaaa--
...men.
no, no one's "going catholic." three children is enough, thank you.
i feel guilty coming here every sunday and never actually buying anything.
candy warhol? xavier nougat?
oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress.
those are eight dollars a pound, sport.
lobsters need salt water.
dad! the fish!
ohh, you don't sound so good. we'd better get you some cold medicine.
oh, homie, you made breakfast.
ooh, so plump and juicy. he's gonna boil up nicely.
the water's boiling! quick, chuck him in!
come on! chuck him in!
let's go! in the pot. in the pot.
he looks like an ordinary... ow! son of a--!
pardon me for asking, but where the hell's my stupid lobster?
daddd...
oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. by the way, i oiled the hinge on your diary.
uh, i am sick of everyone being so proud of me!
and now, to present the grant money, a legendary figure in educational disbursement: state comptroller atkins.
who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
hey, what smells so good?
are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
hip hip--
hey, dad, that light says, "check engine."
oh, come on.
because they discovered gold right over there--
founded by prostitutes in 1849, and serviced by prostitute express riders who could bring in a fresh prostitute from st. joe in three days, bloodbath gulch quickly became known as a place where a trail hand could spend a month's pay in three minutes.
uh, yes, sir?
oh, well... no, you don't... but if you have any interest in history...
wow! have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?
first of all, i'm not a robot. and second, i got this metal ass in 'nam, defending this country for lazy jerks like you. now, what'll you have, partner?
you can get drunk when we get home.
let's forget this whole thing happened.
homer!
up yours! can i go to the bathroom before we leave?
but i really need to--
there's a rest area. pull over.
can i go behind a tree?
please go back! you can make it my birthday present.
but i might explode.
oh, no!
uh, actually, his kidneys were fine yesterday when he had his annual checkup.
homer, with all due respect, this x-ray reveals a textbook kidney blow-out -- which would explain those loud pops you heard.
i'm amazed you're alive now.
well, you could give him a kidney.
you see, the waiting list for a kidney is very long and...
besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you.
check it out, dad. i rented all your favorite gorilla movies. "gorilla squadron," "gorilla island vi,"...
can i fluff your pillow?
well, i gotta hand it to you, homer. you're really brave to go through with this operation.
nah, nah, no. makin' polenta, that's a procedure. you're talkin' about deadly, life-threatening surgery, here.
oh, yeah. and, and even if you survive the operation --
whatever. the point is, with only one kidney, you won't be able to drink yourself stupid no more.
plus they'll put you on one of those organ donor sucker lists. everybody who wants an eyeball or a spine or a vestigial tail will be after you.
listen, i'm just gonna get right to the point, here. can i have your buttocks? i mean, if you die. they look pretty comfortable.
and, uh, are those your original lips?
oh, homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it.
i love you, son.
well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel.
ohh, anything, sweetheart.
well... i said i'd do it, so i guess i'll have to.
dr. martins to podiatry.
don't read it. just sign it.
it simply says you won't hold us responsible if you die as a result of gross negligence. it's a standard form.
i love you, son.
well, if you look closely, you'll see this is a taffy shop shaped like a ship.
arr, what other ships have ye been on?
good enough. welcome aboard "the ship of lost souls".
arr, i've been meaning to paint over that. now come and meet the rest of the damned. did i mention they're lost souls?
ahh, another lost soul has joined our world-weary ensemble.
who are we? no one. where are we sailing? nowhere. do we even exist? who knows?
oh, don't listen to him. we exist all right.
we wander the seven seas, trying to forget.
come, stranger, join our circle of infamy. tell us your story of en-nui.
i stole this accordion from a blind monkey, but you... you disgust even me.
we make a great team, son.
don't worry about old grampa. i'm goin' to a better place. shelbyville hospital! oh, who'm i kiddin'? i'm a goner.
oh, dear.
try not to move, dad. you swallowed a lot of motor oil.
grave nothin'! i never felt more alive! oh! boy, i shouldn'ta done that.
while we were setting your broken bones and putting your blood back in, we helped ourselves to a kidney and gave it to your father.
yes. you've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs.
dad, you're tickling me.
we'll return for the remainder of the conclusion after these messages.
remember, it's bi-mon-sci-fi-con. be there and be square!
/ yeah! / star wars!
that swarm of nerds is gonna kill him!
who are you?
i can't, homer. i twisted my ankle. you guys go on without me!
oh, my god. someone has to go back in for maggie!
wow, that was close. well, thanks a lot, homer.
i'll tell you who. him!
homer, i don't think you were listening to what he just--
as a bodyguard, your only loyalty is to your pro-tectee. not to your family. not to your country. not to moohamed.
shut your sass-hole, boy. these melons represent your pro-tectees. throughout this course, you will pro-tect your personal melon as if it was paying your salary.
okay, listen up! my goal is to assassinate that watermelon. your job is to take the bullet. go! go! go! go! pow!
well, your dive wasn't bad. but i just didn't believe your "nooo!" you gotta sell it. remember, your "nooo!" is what gets you your next job. now drop and gimme twenty. you ladies are without a doubt the most sorrowful clique at the dance -- not one of you fit to guard a russian rock band! however, your checks have cleared, so you all graduate. congratulations. and now, in honor of your achievement, here is the theme song from the hit motion picture, "the bodyguard." and i-i-i-e-e-i-i-i-e-e-i-i-i will always love yooouuu!... ha!
you know, i really don't care for that code name.
nah! i know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?
we just want to get a snack.
homer! i don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.
that's not the point. and another thing. i asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
shove off, puke-holes. get out of there! these stools are reserved for the mayor and his cronies. heh. here's a couple of düffenbraus, on the house, of course.
that "change" was a bribe.
thank you, fat tony. however, in the future, i would prefer a nondescript briefcase to the sack with a dollar sign on it.
well, that's an interesting story. it seems president kennedy's father...
dad! what a nice surprise.
can i still drink it?
those wacky gangsters. what are you gonna do?
help! help!
i'm alive, you idiot! pull me in!
but the gangsters will kill me.
all right! all right, i promise.
i am not so much disappointed as i am blinded with rage.
aren't you scared, dad? i mean, if i were fat tony, and god willing someday i will be, i'd just be stewing in my jail cell, gettin' madder and madder.
you're guarding the mayor tonight? after fat tony swore revenge?
homer!
homer, i'm, uh, not sure it's wise to go out right now. i was thinking of a quiet evening at home with the, uh... wife.
no, no, i truly do want to stay home with the... wife.
nnyyeeeeeesss?
nnyyeeeeeesss.
dear lord, please make tonight's production better than "othello" with peter marshall.
please, i am only here as a devotee of the lively arts. but i do have something for the mayor that perhaps you could deliver.
you moron! that's the kiss of death!
never mind that, just go patrol the perimeter. ah, au gratin potatoes, that's a quality side.
but i'm just here to kill... wha--
he looks awfully familiar.
you're all talk, hamill. you never even finished jedi school. show's over, mayor!
homer... use... the forrr...
the forks... use the forks...!
i checked with the doctor. he said mayor quimby's gonna be fine... and i was electric as nathan detroit. what did you think of me?
ohh... cheer up, homer. i think you made a great bodyguard.
absolutely.
oh, wait, here it is.
i'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.
hockey puuuuucks...
dust!!!
we'd better stop and get the car washed.
hey, homer. car's kinda dirty.
you listen to your friends, but you never listen to me.
no...
that's it.
five dollars, please.
senior citizen's discount.
... and once again, tithing is ten per cent off the top. that's gross income, not net. please people, don't force us to audit. now we're going to pass this around a second time. brother ned, if you'll do the honors.
/ what's he talking about? / what's he saying? / who is he? / etc.
well, that's not quite true--
well, i did, but--
well, yes.
no, no, and double-no! i haven't done any of those things, folks. you name it, i haven't done it!
rod, call doctor stein.
never a dull moment, huh, homer?
here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, homer. but i, i was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun.
yeah, i, i guess i do.
how 'bout it, homer? will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?
stop that! will you help me or not?
so what about all this meat?
now it's marge's time to shine!
seems fair.
of course i... oh, my stars! i can't do that.
all right.
so, what happens next?
okay, homer. i'm ready to learn. what's the first lesson? just give me the topic sentence.
homer, they blew that up yesterday.
ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. i'd better call maude and tell her where i am.
thanks, buddy.
oh, the lights, the noise, the letter x -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. i'm overstimulated! i gotta get out of this town!
if he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp.
and now, the indestructible lance murdock will jump his suicycle over an audience member. and he'll do it while attempting to open a locked safe on his head. any volunteers?
no, homer, no! i wanna do something exciting, but i can't just go from zero to thirty like that! i-i could be killed.
on the x. uh, yeah, paint. now, it's of critical importance that you don't--
well, actually, there are several rockets mounted to the--
okay, he's cleared the ring of fire! past the ring of ice! over the dog doo stick! he's cracked the safe!
god homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. rumba! yea, i was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered.
aw, leave me out of this, homer. games of chance are strictly forbidden by deuteronomy seven--
seven a winner.
oh, righty-o. one betting disk please.
aaand, fourteen black.
how do you do it, homer? how do you silence that little voice that says, "think"? oh no. i-i mean common sense.
you threw it out the...
more libations, my imperial conquerors?
more booze?
look at this place! we must have really painted the town last night. i have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and i don't remember a thing!
oh, i did it! i conquered my fears and i made up for a lot of lost livin'. and i owe it all to the homer simpson program.
well, it's about time you two woke up.
here comes that vomit again.
mm-hm, i'm workin' on that.
take a look at this.
and do you, homer, take this cocktail waitress you just met to be your lawfully wedded wife?
do you want to get married? married!
by the power vested in me by the chicago outfit, i now pronounce you husbands and wives.
you two fellas are the nicest husbands we've ever had, and we're not giving you up without a fight.
ginger's my wife.
homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?
what are we gonna do, homer? my kids are gonna be traumatized! and then there's maude. and then there's maude!
well, do something! this is all your fault. you and your stupid program.
yoohoo.
your behavior is.. is unconscionable!
i want fatty.
for the last time, no!
we found some guys who know how to treat a woman.
what's the occasion?
homer!
uh, do i have to be gang-probed?
what did the aliens look like?
just a reminder, folks, we do have a baseball game today. i am dennis conroy, and heeere come your isotopes!
why do you hate the isotopes so much, dad?
even you?
that's a rotator cuff. his career's over.
but there's only been one pitch!
bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth, and it's do or die.
no, they lost.
with a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs.
quiet! we're watchin' the isotopes!
now we're in the championship game.
well, here's a die-hard fan. sir, your beloved isotopes are about to make history. any thoughts?
the inspiring words of a fan who'll always root, root, root for the home team, even if they lose this ga--
no, no, no, the game's not over --
nobody touched my rumaki.
isotopes!
hey, who's on first?!
slide!
we are the champions / we are the champions / you got mud on your face / big disgrace...
wow, you look really hungover, dad. what did you do last night?
whoa / curfew?
sure you do. you have the right to remain silent.
but it's not fair. adults always blame kids for everything!
what about adultery?
and here we are, locked inside.
meh.
i'm tired of that show. but i've been hearing good things about "talk to the hand." tom shales says the writing "snaps, crackles and pops."
hey, look what i found. grampa's old radio. oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?
we know all your secrets.
oh, homer...
tune in tomorrow, and every day until the curfew is lifted. because we'll be revealing embarrassing secrets about springfield's other adults.
all right, you kids come down now. we promise we won't kill ya.
kids! / you've had your fun, now we've had our fill.
we're gonna teach all of you rugrats a lesson!
you really should have voted, homer.
happy birthday, dad.
doughy's has terrible pizza.
oooh, "free foot pain analysis?"
i guess.
um, dad...
oh, you betcha... absolutely... eh-- uh-oh, oh, oh, wait a minute. these tires won't take a balance.
nah. nah. no. you hear that clunk?
well, that tells me you need four new tires.
yeah. legally, i can't even let you drive out of here on these.
uh, that's it. you're fired!
oh, i know that look. you came in for the free wheel balance and now it's costing you five hundred simoleans.
hey, you got off easy. i just came in to use the phone and they got me for the whole road king package. alignment, shocks, armour all, stem lube...
man, we are a couple of grade "a" suckers. wally kogen.
oh, don't remind me. "friends helping friends," my ass. say, you wanna grab a beer while we're waiting?
yeah, how 'bout that super bowl? you goin' this year?
well, i run the springfield travel agency. we've got a charter bus goin' down to the game. you help us fill it, you can ride for free.
dang! that was my last quarterback. now what am i gonna do? you!
yeah, you. get your hand off my wife's leg.
oh, absolutely. my favorite team's in it: the atlanta falcons . yeah, ever since i was a boy, i've always loved the atlanta falcons .
nah.
nah.
nah.
ahh.
i'm so happy you're going to the big game. my dream has always been to see the bolshoi ballet.
wow, you've signed up quite a few people, dad: sea captain, bumblebee man, comic book guy, the squeaky voiced teen...
yeah. not a dame in sight.
aw, crap. it's that pip-squeak rudy.
whooo!
man, that hurts.
yes, sir! i'm catching a pass from dan marino! this is the greatest moment of my...
hey, bubba. hacksaw. get that moron.
who needs tickets? tickets right here. how 'bout you, slick?
hey, i'm just tryin' to make an honest buck.
yeah. see, the hologram's missing. and there's no such team as the "spongos." and finally, these seem to be printed on some sort of cracker.
oh, how could i fall for fake tickets? gee, the fellas are gonna be crestfallen.
kill 'em!
forget it. you'll just hurt me like all the others.
wait, dad, look!
get back here!
you got my vote.
me? i'm dolly parton.
oo, look at the time. i better scoot to that halftime show. see y'all.
who's ready for some football?!
yeah. where?
what the bloody hell?
let... go... booze!
uh, hello, this is president clinton.
you know, your determination and grit under extreme pressure are an inspiration. the whole country is proud of you.
and on behalf of america, i'd like to...
dad, that doesn't belong to you.
well, we sure put together a heck of a trip, homer. ever thought about being a travel agent?
'cause you can really "go places" in the travel business. huh? feel free to use that one.
locked.
unplugged.
aw geez, there they got me living with an african-american, a semite-american and a woman-american, there. and i'm glad. i love youse all. i love everybody. i wish i'd saved my money from the first show.
isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
it's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of admiral.
this isn't bad.
the renaissance.
well, let's just say i hate crime. arrest that guy. and that's the end of that chapter...
that's not really you, dad. he's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name.
another person wants to congratulate you for having a famous name.
no he's not.
hey homer! homer! check it out. bottom of page twelve.
hey, you're famous.
uh, mr. simpson, sir, can i get your autograph?
uh, homer, we've worked together for ten years. it's carl. you only wrote my name. um, i wanted yours.
so they really based that homer simpson character on you, huh?
simp-sonnnn!!
hey, looks like they changed the character into a bumbling sidekick.
yeah, come on, dum-dum, do something unintelligent, there.
your character provides the comic relief. like... ohhh... marlon brando in "apocalypse now."
get ready, everybody. he's about to do something stupid.
haw haw.
but her forehead's on fire.
your catch phrase is hysterical. please say it clearly for my answering machine tape.
oh, it's never enough, not for them. once they get a taste of you, they want more and more and more. that reminds me, do you mind if my nephew kicks you in the belly?
okay.
homer, your growing insanity is starting to worry me. why don't you talk to the producers of the show? maybe they'll make your character suave again.
bart?
stupid? well, i can assure you, it happened organically.
but then we found out that abc had a similar project in development with annie potts and jeremy piven.
but it scared the hell out of us. so we slapped together a cop show instead.
policecops.
oh, he's not stupid. he's a street-smart, fish-out-of-water in a world he never made.
court finds in favor of "policecops." next case.
what name would you prefer?
max power??
you changed your name without consulting me?
but this will be so confusing. the mailman won't know what to do. did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
and what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
but i fell in love with homer simpson. i don't want to snuggle with "max power."
oh, lord.
isn't that the wrong way?
ah! max power! how's every little thing?
well, who could forget the name of a magnetic individual like you? keep up the good work, max.
sir, traditionally, a monogram is just initials.
very well...
the man knows what he likes.
if you don't, who will, huh? trent steel.
oh, heyyy, great name.
i like a man who can poke fun at himself. ooh, hey, my one o'clock canceled. have you had any lunch?
leading him off) so, where to eat? you like thai?
when did you start liking thai food?
who's trent steel?
what's this wrapped in a banana leaf? mmm, smells like mint.
where'd you meet this trent steel? moe's?
well, i guess your new name is really opening doors for you.
you are invited to a garden party this saturday!
wow, look at this place. the house number is spelled out with letters!
did you wish me to destroy this machine for you?
heh. very well.
very nice, ed. your inventions continue to impress me and the entire nation.
oh, my lord! i feel like cinderella.
eh, maybe later.
ah, max power. trent said i absolutely must meet you. this is fab...
i thought i knew all the players in springfield. where have you been hiding yourself?
attention, please. attention. um, i just wanna say how thrilled i am with this turnout. i'm proud to share my home with springfield's best and brightest.
we've all been blessed with privilege and success.
uh, but with privilege comes grave responsibility...
we all have to give something back to the world that's been so good to us.
we have to protect them, because trees can't protect themselves. except, of course, the mexican fighting trees.
to the protest bus!
i don't know. remember that new year's eve at lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
you can't blame them for having a social conscience.
hang in there, max. saving the environment is a hard, grueling job.
man, i have really had it with you tree-huggers.
something funny, nature boy?
keep runnin', max!
uh, you better call for backup, chief!
slow down, punk!
this is terrible.
well, i'm glad you changed your name back to homer simpson.
g'night.
to what?
chesty larue?!
i don't want to be chesty larue or busty st. claire!
goodnight, homer.
that's not a fairy tale. it's just something that happened to you at moe's.
i didn't turn it on yet.
maybe we should not answer it, huh?
who is your favorite indian pop singer?
oh, yeah, homer's a real go-getter.
maybe we should leave.
you don't know what they're saying.
oh, i hope we didn't get apu in too much trouble.
either put that book down or let me drive.
worse than ever i am afraid. my shameful neglect has made her feel unloved. now, i fear she will leave me.
ooh, ooh, you are right, there's still seven days before valentine's. ah, seven chances to prove my love for sweet manjula.
dad, the vet says we shouldn't make him fetch the sunday paper.
i'd love to look at sculleryweek -- if you're through with it.
this is about investment opportunities in yemen.
hey, look at this one. it's a poem. from apu!
oh, how romantic!
the only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
oh... just once, i'd like a parrot to say that to me. then the bird sang "i love the night life"... with clever new lyrics.
i do too. but it was sweet. women really like that sort of thing, homie.
it's not that monkey card i found in the car, is it?
homer, i've gone through seven years of receipts, and you've spent less on gifts for me than you have on temporary tattoos.
oh, moe.
i got some of that myself. / oh, screw myself.
hey, watch it! you're all over the road!
aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. how can we sabotage his labor of love?
hey, there he goes!
uh, homer, you're drivin'.
there he is. behind that shopping bag... a croissant? what the...? oh, that's right. they have breakfast at tiffany's now.
well, this is turning out to be a total waste of time.
man, that smarts!
i told you we shouldn't have gone for long-term parking.
i got it. i got it. apu musta hired him to sing for manjula.
oh, that's very sweet. have a grammy.
really? i did that?
don't be frightened. that tank's just peace corps surplus.
homer! what a delightful coincidence.
i have to deliver a message! it's the skywriter's code.
stop, you crazy fool, you'll kill us all!
oh, galldurnit! why won't you die?!
homer? what in the world?
just when i think i have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses.
oh, homie. oh, they're beautiful. oh, i'm gonna snuggle your brains out.
well, seems as though we're just about at the halfway point, so why don't we call it intermission? oh! don't go too far. if you like cafeteria workers in beatle wigs with tennis racquet guitars, you won't wanna miss the second half.
dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks.
mom, to your left. he's letting you in. go!
so long, schlubs!
go ahead, drool all you want. ya can't hurt that finish. now, rain water, that'll strip it right off. sa-- aw, and i shouldn't have said that. c'mon, gil.
okay, you've got the undercoating, clear coating, rust proofing, underguard spray, gravelguard xj, vita-seal, repelzit... but if you wanna protect the paint, you better keep it in this tent.
okay, here's how your lease breaks down. this is your down payment... then here's your monthly... and there's your weekly...
yup. oh, then, after your final monthly payment, there's the routine c.b.p., or crippling balloon payment.
right.
yeah, you don't see many men driving the f series.
see? instead of a cigarette lighter, it's got a lipstick holder.
a pretty thing like you can do whatever she wants.
you cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid canyonero. why can't you drive it?
i don't think you're gay. i just have to do my grocery shopping. now please gimme my keys.
so?
oh, i'll come watch you do nothing after i try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights. nobody will ever cut me off again!
how could they take away my license? it feels like i lost a limb.
no, your father drives like an old lady.
bart, they're not here to entertain us.
but dad, lemurs are nocturnal.
no!
throw your peanuts!
get in! get in! c'mon, homer! jump!
looks like it's time for plan b. one, two, three, "b"! it's okay, homie. you can come out now.
stone philips again!
do you think there's anything great on nbc right now?
but there's only one way to find out!
okay, fdr is in the white house, an ice cream cone costs a nickel, and a hot new tune by benny goodman is hitting the charts. the year is 1939.
let me guess. you travel back in time again?
easy, homer. i'll bring you back.
yeah, too bad we gotta work, huh, homer? homer?
c'mon, move your butt! you're blocking traffic!
come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair.
what?
okay, dad, we're ready.
oh, quit complaining. it's half the work of the divorced dad.
homer...
hysterical, but i traded my turn to lisa for her dessert.
she didn't say it yet!
the book fair?
oh, this is perfect!
no! the smithsonian traveling exhibit. it encapsulates america and makes history come alive!
sorry, dad. my mind is made up.
i can answer that. uncle sam needs to spend our tax dollars on the essentials: anti-tobacco programs, pro-tobacco programs, killing wild donkeys, and israel.
look, they have lincoln's hat!
america's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.
who's fonzie?
get out of archie bunker's chair! now!
look, he got chocolate on it!
really, that much? it's gonna cost ten thousand dollars to repair that document.
of course omnitouch understands that real money doesn't grow on trees. not these days.
we sure do. it's called caring.
we prefer to think of them as "keep-in-touch towers."
plus you've increased springfield's roaming capabilities 64 percent.
i guess...
ugh, that antenna is an eyesore.
yeah, well, i hope it doesn't hum too loud, 'cause i have a ton of homework to do, and if i don't finish it by... my room!
what happened to my room?!
you gave away my room!
i can't believe you did this, dad. why didn't you put that thing in your room?
but where am i supposed to live?!
until you taped over it, "the little mermaid."
homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!
oh, that's not the point. we should report this to an omnitouch care-rep. people's privacy is at stake.
ohhh! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it!
dad, will you please tell bart to stop squeaking his chair. i'm trying to do my homework.
no-ho-ho...
race ya!
i am trying to do my homework.
dad, why did you have to take away my room?
i just want to study.
da-ad!
that's awful!
my tummy really hurts.
is that somebody you, homer?
okay, then you can take lisa to dr. hibbert's.
lisa i'm afraid your tummy ache may be caused by stress.
yes... anyway, when it comes to stress, i believe laughter is the best medicine. you know before i learned to chuckle mindlessly, i was headed for an early grave myself.
i'm really not the chuckling type.
yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --
they're not all crazy, dad.
you know, just because you say something is crazy, doesn't make it so. and just because you think museums are boring and demolition derbies are fun, doesn't make that true either!
dad, you don't have to go to a new age store just for me. i know you think this stuff is stupid.
i just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.
namaste.
may i tell you about our white light specials?
well, your tongue works.
fetal grindings. but i have a better idea.
no, mr. simpson, this is a sensory deprivation tank. it blocks out all the external distractions that bombard our souls.
i'll take two hours.
you're about to take a journey into the mind. you may see and experience things that are strange and frightening. but remember, they can't physically harm you, though they may destroy you mentally.
gee, i should cut dad some slack. after all, he did take me to the ballet, and the smithsonian exhibit... in fact, he takes me lots of places he hates.
hi, dad. how was it?
pretty cool. but now, whaddaya say we go do something we'll both enjoy?
mmm.
well, you told her, dad.
you still haven't told us why lenny bit you.
i think i read somewhere that cows like being killed.
you didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
well, there is one steak that's only available by special request, uh... we call it, uh, "sir loin-a-lot." it's, uh, the size of a boogie-board.
very good, sir. ladies and gentlemen... this brave man has accepted the sir loin-a-lot challenge. he will pit his stomach against sixteen pounds of indomitable tenderloin.
uh, if you want some friendly advice, pal, i wouldn't tackle the big'un right away.
red barclay's my name. i'm a trucker, and i've eaten steaks from coast to coast, with taters and toast. take my advice, this one's not for greenhorns.
it's an insult. sock him, dad. sock everybody.
no, homer! don't fill up on bread!
oh, humans are so ridiculous. he's not even halfway through walter and he's already hallucinating.
the winner and still champion, reliable red barclay!
there goes the finest trucker who ever lived.
in 38 years, he never missed a shipment. but i guess this is one delivery ol' red won't be making.
oh no. oh, no...
oh, lemme go with you, dad!
don't you have work?
good-bye, homer.
oh, all right. good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip.
well, you're not really a trucker now.
well, according to red's schedule, we have to make it to atlanta in three days.
if you wanna be my lover / you gotta get with my friends / makin' love forever / friendship's where that ends / if you wanna be my lover...
no, dad. he wants you to blow your horn.
a little more high-test, darlin'?
i'll be right back with your pie, hon.
yeah.
i suppose.
will that be all, sweetie?
what about... erika?
uh-huh. bet he used bait, too.
actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours.
well, congress is racing back to washington to outlaw these...
hey! you can't take that many pep pills at once!
yeah, that navitron auto-drive system's made our jobs cushier than ever.
you know, this thing. with this baby drivin' your truck for ya, all you gotta do is sit back and feel your ass grow.
sh-hey-hey-hey-sh! didn't your union rep tell you about the scam we got goin'?
we get 40 bucks an hour to drive these rigs. you think anybody'd hire us if they knew we weren't really drivin' the trucks?
well, well. / what's that? / will wonders never cease?
he hit us!
dad, they're trying to kill us!
dad, stop!
what are you doing?
huh?
i'm afraid i can't let you do this, red. the risk is unacceptable.
yep. you're gonna make it, dad. and somewhere up there, i bet red is saying thanks.
all right, let's see... artichokes... aannnd migrant workers. lookin' good. so, where is ol' red anyway?
yeah, that sounds like red, all right.
any thoughts on how we're gonna get there?
are you crazy? i'm not driving a trainload of napalm to springfield!
and as we pass the collection plate, please give as though the person next to you were watching.
thank you, helen. and thank you all for your kind contribu-- . a chocolate bunny?! who put this wicked idol in the collection plate?
oooo. what a beautiful garden. it's almost like paradise.
uh, i guess.
speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?
good morning, adam. any bacon for you, then?
oh adam, you're too kind.
well, i'd better skedaddle. oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there? i hate to be a bossy betty, but i have to forbid you to eat its fruit.
oh, how cute. let's call this little guy a "groundhog..."
really? well, what do you call that thing on the branch?
please stop eating that. god's gonna furious.
well, it is a sin to waste food...
adam, say something.
lovely day in paradise, isn't it?
today i'm featuring mouth-watering pork ribs. tuck in, then!
i'm toiling! what does it look like?
well, it's a little late for apologies now.
i'll be fine. just give me a second to... ugh...
and after i created my fingers to the bone for you i... my unicorn! oh, what have they done to you, gary?
oh, shut up. you are so banished.
king solomon, these men need you to settle a dispute. they each claim ownership of this pie.
oh, how embarrassing. oh, we slept right through church.
it's the rapture. and i never knew true love.
why aren't we ascending into heaven? oh, right. the sins.
dad!
homer!
i said homer!
you know, homie, a lot of men use their saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint.
i'm serious. you never finished painting the garage. and you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
yup.
hey, get off my case. the only reason i'm working here is 'cause i'm trying to get a date with "mom."
hi, i'm doug vaccaro. you know me as chip, the wisecracking assistant on the hit sitcom, "toolin' around."
but today i'm here as a "tool" of global dynamics corp. you know, installing your own barbecue pit is no harder than adding an aviary, or olympic-sized swimming pool. in fact, it's a snap! or if you're not into chicken...
how 'bout wild boar? or swordfish? or hippo?
light-hearted apron not included. snapping fingers may not make food appear.
can i burn evidence in it?
dad, i really need to rest my back.
all returned items must be in a box and accompanied by a receipt.
yeah, hold on there, santa claus. that box is for toys only.
yeah, nice try, saint nick. now hit the road, kris kringle.
homie, someone's at the door. they want to talk to you about some sort of car accident.
mr. simpson? i believe something of yours struck my car yesterday.
that's your license plate, isn't it?
i'm not here to sue you. my name is astrid weller. i own an art gallery and i'd love to display your piece.
art isn't just pretty pictures. it's an expression of raw human emotion. in your case, rage.
is everything okay? i got worried when i didn't hear any shots.
your husband's work is what we call "outsider art." it could be by a mental patient or a hillbilly or a chimpanzee.
well, you should be very excited, because outsider art couldn't be hotter.
dad, chew with your mouth closed. you're losing your mystique.
congratulations, homer -- you're now a professional artist!
where are you going with that junk, dad?
homie, i'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?
that's my life you're describing.
well, if it'll help - um, mom found out her engagement ring is made of rock candy.
i must get back to my hotel and practice my affectations for tomorrow. bon soir.
nothin', nothin'. just gimme a priceless sketch with a certificate of authenticity.
wonderful news, homer.
uh, no. we're going to hold a show devoted entirely to you.
i'm happy for you. now g'night.
no, homer, being an artist was my dream. but now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than i have in my whole life.
that's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if i, i don't know, entered a belching contest?
you don't understand.
well, i guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy.
homer is the most dangerous artist on the springfield scene. now, let's see what surprises he has for us tonight.
i'll give you two bucks for the bird, if it's still alive.
come on, gunter, kyoto. if we hurry we can still catch the heroin craze.
homer, i know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same.
who?
it's so exciting to do something cultural together.
a claes oldenburg. he's a european who defied convention and embraced american popular culture.
now this is a joseph turner. in an era when everyone else painted portraits, he broke away by painting the venetian canals.
and picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. by the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. they call it his "angry jerk" period.
any ideas yet?
soup's on, fat boy!
homer... homer...
well, dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like christo.
no, christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. he once wrapped the reichstag in plastic.
oh, yes, and he also set up hundreds of yellow umbrellas along the california highway...
to make the world a more magical place, i guess. although they did blow over and kill some people.
no, dad, no. my point is you have to do something big and daring.
see you in hell, "god bless this house."
it wasn't easy, but i got all the grizzlies.
are you sure this is art, not vandalism?
oh lord. what now? oh, that can't be good.
homer, what have you done?
well, homer, i have to admit, you created something people really love. you truly are an artist.
ohh...
yep.
that's us.
yeah, go for the gold, dad!
you papier mache'd my cat?!
good work, dad.
ow!!
oh! / springs!
"coming! hey, hey, hey! children, children, future, future..."
are you talking to me or the beer?
poland, eh? ha. too easy. how you doin', germany? here's my impression of an east german woman, "kiss me or i'll crush you."
that place sucks! the nurses don't let grampa do anything. they practically chew his food for him.
sounds good to me!
delivery for homer simpson.
but we lost the olympics to shelbyville.
to who?
hey, thanks. ow! my eye! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
homer, get outta here.
nothing.
are you okay?
i want you to get rid of these springs.
give me my baby!
i want these springs out of our house today.
you're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?
what the heck's going on?
i don't know how you can all just lay around the house on a nice day like this. when was the last time we went for a good old-fashioned family walk?
get a horse!
we're walking, homer.
oh, look! there's the store where i buy my yarn. but you don't want to buy your buttons there.
where'd you get that champagne?
all this commotion just for a store?
i do! i do! / right here!
ha! all right. what's your name, young man?
well, i hope this starts you on your way to a great fortune. now, who wants the second dollar?
uh... well... all right. here. now...
i need your help. i want to be loved.
i want you to look at me the way i saw you look at arthur fortune.
yes! that's the look i'm looking for. what would make you and your slovenly kind look at me that way?
a charitable donation, eh? well, there's a first time for everything. take this check for two hundred thousand dollars to the springfield hospital.
well, i will be when the morphine wears off, but until then, teedily deedily dee dee. teedily dee dee dee. woo hoo hoo. hee hee hee.
all right, let's get this geezer out quick so we can bring in the lesbian gladiators.
that didn't go well, did it?
oh... what's the use? i'll never be a popular, beloved billionaire like arthur fortune.
and a stunt like that impresses people?
well, if a couple of chinese bamboo gobblers can win people's hearts, i'm gonna bring them something that man has searched for since the dawn of time.
ach. the whole town's turned out. i've never seen them so excited.
aye.
where's my monster, tubby? what do you people think i'm paying you for?
the beast looks something like this, only without the saucy t-shirt.
we're the laughingstock of the town.
nay. 'tis merely loch ness high school's discarded homecoming float.
tough luck, simpson.
i was really starting to enjoy ethnic mismatch comedy #644. i've never heard so many viagra jokes in thirty seconds.
attention springfield. how low will you go... to win a trip to -- hawaii? this saturday our judges will select the lowest, most disgusting nitwit in town... and send him straight to maui! sponsored by "grandma plopwell's." the low-fat pudding that's approved for sale... by the government!
next up, homer and his amazing reddenbacher dreamcoat, with a number he calls, "kernel knowledge."
all right, judges? who is our winner?
an open letter to the people of springfield: today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding.
you won second place?
well, most of us. dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?
dad, stop kidding around. look, they printed my letter.
well, i'm sure someone had the time to read it.
oh, yes. your name?
all right, mr. simpson...
don't worry, these photos are perfectly legal. many husbands use them as a romantic gift for their wives.
well, yes, unless you have some issues with revealing your body.
oh dad, i just spent the day with the most wonderful people.
well, for the first time in my life i feel that someone understands...
are you ready in there, mr. simpson?
just come out.
you look fantastic. let me just adjust my lens here.
light is not your friend. all right, let's do this thing.
oh, homie.
homie? well, look at you...
homer, i've never seen this side of you! but i like it... wooh, wooh. look at those silk pillows. it's like the set of some high-class porno film!
hold on, wha-- that's our basement?
it looks so elegant. and all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. you've got to show me exactly what you did.
silence. i don't need anyone to talk for me except this voice-box. you have clearly been corrupted by power. for shame!
yeah, just try me you-- oh!
lisa, thank god you're okay.
who's up for some beers?
your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing, homer. i may have to steal it.
i didn't say that.
dad, it's not...
this is "wired." it's about computers and technology. hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in springfield! will you take me, dad? please? i'll show you how to order pizza over the internet...
bart! the internet is more than a global pornography network. it's a...
wow, dad, you're surfing like a pro.
dad, that's fox!
dad, do we have any money left?
we were robbed?!
we were saving that money for our family vacation. now we're gonna have to start all over again.
evening, neighbor. low on funds again?
now, homer, we can't have you burglarizing us every time you've got a bill to pay.
oh, we're not as well-off as you think. we give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. and the leftorium's business has gone way downhill since leftopolis moved in next door.
oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. they were evidence in a murder trial!
we got that tip at the chuck garabedian mega-savings seminar.
he taught us how to live a burt reynolds lifestyle on a mac davis income. we've already got tickets for his next seminar. i think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
are you tired of missing out on the good things in life? family vacations, jet packs, solid gold dancers...
squeeze every penny! squeeze every penny!
thirty-three cents? i paid almost double that. eww...
um, according to the mexican council of food, this expired two years ago.
this also says it can cause red tide poisoning.
homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom.
come on, transylvania.
c'mon, homer! japan!
never mind. looks like the flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
come on, homer, japan will be fun. you liked "rashomon."
homer!
i never knew jim belushi made so many movies.
to-ga! to-ga! toga 2000!
homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open.
mom, lis! check it out. dad's on tv.
what the--?
robots be right back.
me too. let's go to an authentic japanese noodle house!
and?
don't ask me! i don't know anything! i'm product of american education system. i also build poor quality cars and inferior-style electronics.
oh my goodness, homer, those are a hundred and fifty dollars.
but you promised me we'd do something japanese.
hey, look. isn't that woody allen?
says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring.
tubby?
congratulations. i am the emperor and...
your wife has paid your bail, mr. simpson-san.
now can we do something japanese?
honey, i know you want to see japan, but we're down to our last million yen.
oh, it's beautiful, dad.
be careful. we need that money to get home.
knife-ah goes in, guts-ah come-ah out, that's-ah what osaka seafood concern is all about.
don't patronize me! now, simpson family, have you picked a wish?
now our gameshows are a little different from yours. your shows reward knowledge. we punish ignorance.
okay, let's begin. our categories are "ow, that hurts," "why are you doing this to me?" and "please let me die."
i had an inkling.
mr. simpson, we'll cut you down as soon as you answer one question about japan.
congratulations simpsons, the airline tickets are yours. all you have to do is to pick them up...from inside that volcano.
this vacation really blows.
lisa!
oh, i'm afraid this might be the end.
don't worry, that "lava" is just orangeade made by our sponsor, osaka orangeade concern.
it's loaded with wasabi. kudos, simpsons, you have won your freedom!
ahh, folks, we're experiencing some moderate godzilla-related turbulence at this time, so i'm gonna go ahead and ask you to put your seatbelts back on. when we get to thirty-five thousand feet, he usually does let go. so, from there on out all we have to do is worry about mothra and uh, we do have reports he's tied up with gamra and rodan at the present time. thank you very much.
electricity: the fuel of the future. test drive the elec-taurus today and get a free gift.
i'm proud of you, dad. buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the earth's supply... you're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?
bart! well, that shut me up.
well, it's always nice to meet people concerned about the environment.
boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier.
ah! dad, you're headed for the harbor!
hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is.
i know, but we didn't.
perfect.
they're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring mel gibson!
who cares? mel gibson!
were you or lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. people magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... homer, let's make love!
of course, homey. aren't you thinking about me?
"and he fought for them once, for the only reason any man ever does. because of one plain simple rule: love thy neighbor..."
it's not boring. he's passionate about government.
excellent. / that man knows how to filibuster.
i liked it. it was nice to see a movie where people solved their problems with words, instead of bullets and chasing.
eh, yes sir?
there you go.
i'm looking for homer simpson.
quiet! dad's gonna get his butt kicked by mel gibson! knock his teeth out, homer!
mr. simpson, i need your help.
i think you're right about my movie and i want you to help me make it better.
but, dad, i thought you hated...
don't sell your husband short, mrs. simpson.
homer is a brutally honest man, completely tactless and insensitive.
i don't have much time, homer. will you come to hollywood with me?
dodge caravan.
can i stay with you, dad?
i don't think so.
no.
you want me to replace the villain with a dog? i mean nobody'll know what's going on!
maybe this wasn't a good idea, homer. i'm sorry i dragged you out here. l-let me pay your bus fare home.
the filibuster scene? that was jimmy stewart's favorite!
you really think the end is boring?
hmm, i guess it is a little flat. okay, let's reshoot the ending. i'll call the hair and make-up ladies. you see if the teamsters will work for free.
okay, this new ending...
... is a little different than what we had, but i think you'll like it. it's missing some sound effects and the computer guys haven't added the twinkle in my eye...
yield this, senator payne... i move we impose some serious term limits!
but this was gonna be the studio's prestige picture. like "howard's end," or "sophie's choice."
i don't make movies to win awards -- especially now that i have two oscars. i make movies for guys like him.
who are you, anyway?
executive producer?
you put me down, you big lummox! je-eedd!!
homer! land mine!
well, i've been told i can play anywhere from 28 to...
well, that's it homer. we should've known better than to match wits with studio executives.
homer, what are you doing here?
oh, forget it, homer, let's just give 'em the stupid movie.
that really wasn't my intention.
movies mean that much to you, homer?
oh sorry, honey, i used up the last roll on that man i thought was judge judy.
what are you doing?
will you please tell me the rest of the plan?!
no, they didn't. they attacked us in a horribly bloody battle. remember?
jump!!! homer, are you okay?!
all in favor, say die! that digital sound really lets you hear the blood splatter.
i'm jimmy stewart's granddaughter and you'll be hearing from my attorney!
it's not your fault, homer. i guess there's just no room in today's crazy, gentle america for violent dinosaurs like us.
i blame the internet. and the return of swing music.
i don't.
thank you for coming.
your son is a ravenous demon, relentlessly gnawing at all that's good and true.
but worst of all, he drags down the grades of anyone who sits near him. just look at this pattern.
how should i know? the point is, a.d.d. makes children restless and easily distracted.
... unless you're willing to try a radical, untested, potentially dangerous...
good lord. he's gotten into the pep closet!
check this out.
how will we get bart to take these?
medication?
i don't want to take drugs.
tommy lee...
he's just flamboyant.
dad, i admit i have some problems, but drugs aren't the answer.
nice try, homer.
oh, mom... all right. i'll do it for you.
no, but here's a book called "chicken soup for the loser" that gave bill buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats.
i think it's the bright blue pants. i mean, you're not on a golf course.
that's gonna save all kindsa travel time.
neyin war? dérdine?
a guy could do great things with a gadget like that.
that's right. you stay on the ball, you stay on the wall.
bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and i could have a night out!
i was thinking of something a little more... adult.
and then afterwards...
all right, girls, tops off. it's showtime!
i heard about a new bar where men dance with men. doesn't that sound adorable?
i'm so glad you're here. bart's really acting funny.
it can read your electronic organizer from space.
who else? major league baseball.
aagghh!
i had a feeling this might happen. this carboxyl group sometimes causes problems.
no!
oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero.
i don't think he has diarrhea.
homer, you're supposed to be hunting for bart!
what a day. first the drinking fountain squirts me, and now this!
dad, that junkie is your son!
not the church! jesus lives there!
hey, at least i got to see some cool colors.
why is the zero made out of glass?
dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?
dingus!
i'm no hero. i just like to hit people in the head.
dad, that's an ambulance.
welcome to the springfield shopper, established in 1883. the newspaper was founded by johnny newspaperseed... a fourteen-year-old boy who roamed america, founding newspapers.
check it out, dad. you can print out the headline from the day you were born.
who are you and why are you ruining my retirement party?
well, at least you like the food.
i get the picture.
enough already!
hey, listen, i just had a thought. we're looking for a new food critic. someone who doesn't immediately pooh-pooh everything he eats.
look, i'd like to give you a tryout. write a 500 word sample review. if it passes muster, we'll put you on staff.
you know, homie, the "e" doesn't work on that typewriter.
this is a joke, right? i mean, this is the stupidest thing i've ever read.
well, you keep using words like "pasketti" and "momatoes," you make numerous threatening references to the u.n., and at the end, you repeat the words "screw flanders" over and over again...
aw, look, homer, i'm sorry, but...
well, we went to paté labelle last week. how 'bout that?
the food is delicious.
hm. what's the english equivalent for ? i'd say... transcendent.
uh, i don't think so.
497... 498 words. hmph.
bon appetit.
not bad... not bad at all. we're gonna run this on page one! of section h-2.
that takes four hours!
this is so exciting, homie. your first restaurant review.
here you are, one critic special. if anything appears to be moving, that's just freshness. arrr.
yeah, now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt, we'll be on easy street.
wow, my first published article. although someone else's name is on it.
and there's that awful script from the cable guy!
the food is exquisite...
hey, homer, great call on that chicken place. and on that rib place. i never knew everything was so good.
hey homer, c'mere!
no.
some of your fellow critics wanted to meet you ... this is garth trelawny, tv critic...
homer! this is our theater critic, daphne beaumont.
homer, please!
jamie kilday, farm supply critic. just got back from the gopher poison show in paris. let me tell you something, people. the days of clubbing them with a baseball bat are over.
listen, we've been meaning to have a talk with you about your reviews. everything's a rave! nine thumbs up? what the hell is that?
well, the only bad review you gave was to a slice of pizza you found under the couch.
good lord, man, you're a critic! you don't have to like everything. e.g., my latest review: "we see john deere has come out with this year's line of rototillers. surprise surprise, they're green. i say it's time to send john deere a 'dear john.'"
you don't have to patronize me.
it's not!?
dad, that's so mean.
but what if someone bad tells me to...
i chop-a you good!
who wants pork chops?
you always liked my pork chops.
you like shake and bake. you used to put it in your coffee.
oh, yeah? what's a palate?
dad, you're being cruel for no reason -- what will people think?
not anymore. i don't wanna be partners with a man who feels like that.
ruff!
chewy?
homer, what gives with this review? you say the salad tastes like "bark", the potatoes were very . this reads like it was written by a dog.
listen, you gotta shape up. next week is the "taste of springfield" festival, and you'll be reviewing every restaurant in town. remember, people have certain expectations about the lifeways section.
homie, my women's intuition's acting up. something bad's going to happen if you go in there.
i'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
we can find him faster by splitting up. you take fried foods. you take salty snacks. i'll take desserts. break!
a rude frenchman? well, i never!
dad, no! it's gonna kill you!
don't! uh... um... it's low-fat!
lou and his frittatas. oh, he likes eggs.
what bad things? why?
uh, dad?
i still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.
i'm having a hard time seeing. homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?
ned flanders!
they'll never believe a simpson killed a flanders by accident. even i have my doubts.
neddy? where have you been?
oh, i'm so relieved. whenever you go on one of your late night fog walks, i get so worried.
well, come on down, you goofy roofy.
my pies are done!
... and now ned's best friend will say a few words. homer?
shut up! shut up! shut up!
stop winking.
no more murders.
who could be calling at this hour?
i know you're alone.
is this maude flanders?
you can't kill the undead, silly.
i'm making record time on this fog walk! ooo, better pick up the pace. 
yeah...
remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite!
hey, homer. weren't you the plant's y2k compliance officer?
it musta been hard debugging all those computers, huh homer?
you did fix them, right dad? because even a single faulty unit could corrupt every other computer in the world.
oh, no. it's happening.
who's going to clean up all those jets? there goes the clothesline.
it's got a computer chip in it. everything does.
hey, everybody! they're looting the mall. hurry! i got nine shoe buffers!
i don't want you looting!
well, look at the wonders of the computer age now.
i think that was implied by what i said.
they're evacuating the earth! we're saved!
i'm not dead!
there it is!
they must be starting a new civilization on mars with our best and brightest.
name please.
uh-huh. and your name is?
love ya lots!
hey, look, another spaceship!
are you still talking about the earth?
wait a minute. they're not so great.
yeah, ain't that a kick in the teeth? i mean, my shows weren't great, but i never tied people up and forced 'em to watch. and i could've. 'cause i'm a big guy. and i'm good with knots.
'fraid so. but hey, the grub's pretty good, huh?
hey, turn those frowns around!
don't worry, dad. we'll be dead in five minutes.
do they really think cheapening the memory of our veterans will sell soda?
i'm sorry, but we're not supposed to put butter on the milk duds.
touché.
your honor has been insulted! this will not stand.
are you crazy, dude?
the dude is crazy!
my hero!
yeah, thanks. it's just past the end of the bar, next to the heavyset guy.
all right, take it easy. take it easy. i'm just saying you ain't no, uh, tommy tune.
i-- your what now?
hey, a duel? i, ah-- isn't that a little extreme? here, here, have a free beer.
yeah, i ain't never been slapped with no duelin' glove before, either.
suh, your challenge is accepted.
you'll need a will and headstone, aisle six.
yeah, he's probably just a big blowhard like you.
oh, no!
why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
looks like you were saved by a christmas tree.
oooh, yes indeedy, homer. looks like they're settling in for a long stay.
to continue talking, please deposit ten cents.
where are we gonna live?
that has people living in it. you can see them through the windows.
yeah, git yer own habitat.
you have offended me, suh. i challenge you to-- come back here! why, you yellow belly...
where are we going, dad?
then why are you driving so fast?
you mean grampa's old farm?
what a dump!
holy moly, we can't stay here. it's full of raccoons.
are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
i'll repress the rage i'm feeling.
it doesn't sound very tractor-y.
dad!
well, well, look at the city slicker pullin' up in his fancy german car.
well pardon us, mr. gucci loafers.
well la-dee-da, mr. park-avenue manicure.
you're not gonna grow nothin' on the old simpson place. that's why your daddy abandoned it.
well, i know your soil ph is up around 9.6, and you need it seven to eight, max.
wow, dad, this is the juiciest watermelon i ever tasted.
what are you planting?
paw!
maybe it needs more fertilizer.
well, if it isn't mr. salad fork. you couldn't grow stink on a monkey.
dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at krusty-burger.
wasn't skipping town in the first place a coward's way out?
it's eerily beautiful, but are you sure this is safe?
you got that from a movie poster!
where'd you get that?
is that plutonium on your gums?
but it's only been one night.
yeah, but didn't grasshopperus kill chad everett?
oh.
oh, honey, give it up.
wait, dad, you don't have to kill yourself.
something's growing.
what is it? carrots? peas? maybe it's okra.
maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
it does. but it's smooth and mild. and refreshingly addictive.
"tomacco?" that's pretty clever, dad. i mean, for a product that's evil and deadly.
excuse me, mr. farmer man. i promised my son he could tip over his first cow, and i... "tomacco?"
i was here first! / c'mon, c'mon people!
don't forget your mincemeat pie!
hello, folks. would you and your family like to take a ride with us?
homer, we're in a bit of a pickle. kids are crazy about tobacco, but the politicians won't let us sell it to them.
tell me about it. but there's no law against selling kids tomacco. that little "m" is worth a lot of money to us... and to you.
... million dollars.
shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
you're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. you've gotta destroy this plant.
just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
now you can't tell me nicotine's not addictive.
give them the plant, homer!
well! what a lovely gift. gotta run!
i've never been so glad to be home.
i don't mind if i do.
you okay, dad?
dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for.
num num, maggie. num num.
i can't get maggie to eat. maybe if you try...
homer!
all right, smart guy. where's the fire?
turn around, simpson.
hey homer, what gives?
hey, you wanna come bowling with us tonight?
oh no, not lenny. not lenny!
poo. uh, homer, what wacky name do you want?
yeah.
simpson! even for a bowler, you're fat!
uhh, actually, i'd say you're having a severe psychotic episode.
hey, homer. that's four strikes in a row. you got a perfect game going!
oh, right. sorry. miss! miss! sorry, i was calling the waitress. ah, this split you sold me is making me choke.
hey, spare me your gutter mouth. ow!
now listen, your father really needs to concentrate. so we'll just stay here and not disturb him.
you did it, homie!
ho-mer! ho-mer!
mr. simpson bowled a perfect game without the aid of steroids, crack, angel dust, or the other narcotics that are synonymous with pro bowling.
will you be my dad?
uhhh, homer...
according to redbook magazine, what is the speed of light?
make me center square, kent! i'm ready. i can handle it.
ohh, we've got to stop putting these flavors of the month on.
yeah, homer, you can't just ride one accomplishment forever. why do you think i stopped acting and became a director?
now before my partner teller hits the shark-infested water, i'll need to borrow someone's crossbow. i only need one. now to save my partner's life, i'll need complete...
you idiot! you'll ruin everything!
would you shut up?!
he'll do it! i'm not the first teller!
that's right! you are!
burt reynolds, class act. well now, for our segment, "yesterday's news"... featuring homer simpson. are you as bored as i am with the antics of this warmed-over fred flintstone? i say it's time to put this one-trick pony out to stud.
homer!
dad, what she's saying is you've had your moment in the sun and now it's time for you to gracefully step aside.
are you comparing yourself to our lord?
ohhh, homey, is that what's bothering you?
well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.
geez, homer. i never seen you so depressed. as your life partner, i'm very worried.
hey, mr. s. i didn't know you bungeed.
no, no! you're too heavy!
hey, look out! oh, dumbass, trying to get yourself killed?
look, i'd love to help you out, homer, but i'm taking my kids to the zoo.
daddy, we're missing the fantasti-potamus. she only sings twice a day!
really? you have children? oh, well look, here's some money.
usually when you say that, you give the money back.
if you tie a string around your finger real tight, you can make it turn purple.
mr. simpson, you're going to be fine. although you do seem to have swallowed a number of shark eggs.
well, i don't want to pry into your personal life...
it's quite simple -- when a parent's life is in danger, a child can summon superhuman strength.
these swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. i mean, a green table! i wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams.
you put it together yourself. all you need is me, allen wrench.
hello, simpsons!
oh, yes sir. quite happily.
well, sure we have, but the decision to have a child is not to be made lightly. mm. on the other hand, monkey see, monkey do!
by chilling my loins, i increase the chances of impregnating my wife.
just stop spouting those hackneyed quips.
you know, homer, you might want to open those cans before they explode.
o-kay.
no, still no luck. tell me, homer, did you have to take any special steps when you decided to have children?
well, not to us they don't. oh homer, we have tried everything! oysters, gravity boots, sanjay's bed, every possible position...
eh, yes.
i'm willing to play the high school jock, but did you have to cut the roof off my car?
"loosen up, baby. tomorrow i'm shipping off to vietnam." i... i thought i was going to ivy league state.
just promise not to forget me on your dinosaur-bone-digging-up trip...
homer!
you have octuplets. it rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
mm-hmm. well, that would only account for quintuplets. did anyone else slip this woman fertility drugs?
gee, sorry for being born.
you know, i saw apu today. he's really frazzled.
apu told me all eight babies have colic. although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.
yes, dear. from the nuclear plant.
knock, knock!
oh look who's here, the family with one baby. how do you manage?
let's hear it for dazzle!
oh, my little treasures. we'll get you out of this terrible place. she's waking up!
it's not just you prancin' around in a monkey suit, is it?
we'll do our best, chutney-butt.
plus, you'll meet a dog who can't predict anything! then, three other things! when we come back, we'll show you the contents of a supermodel's stomach!
hey, remember the fifties? remember television, coca-cola, and dick clark?
why don't we eat there tonight?!
it's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.
dad, they have those everywhere.
dancing!
well, well, well, i've never seen such reckless disregard for a wife's well-being in my life. you've just won yourselves a motorcycle!
man, you're bending the hell out of that kick-stand, dad. why don't you just take it for a ride?
yeah, i promise.
you're kidding? you don't know how. 
yeah, you can arrest me, but you'll never defeat the cobras. nothing can defeat a motorcycle gang.
sweet hog, mr. simpson.
will you turn that engine off?
look what you've done! you've ruined the display!
never, pops.
hey, homer! can i join?
the chri... i-i-i don't think you understand my objection...
hell's satans, huh? i'm watchin' you punks.
you'll make a mistake some day. and then you're going straight to juvie.
cobras? i thought you were the hell's satans.
get away from my store, you young hoodlums.
you took a picture of me when i was asleep?
we're the hell's satans, out of bakersfield.
take off that jacket, man.
now eat it.
hey, hey, chew with your mouth closed, please.
you got anything else with our logo on it?
you gotta eat them, too.
yeah, it's part of being a lowlife.
forget it, simpson. those pig noises you made really hurt my feelings -- looking like a pig as i do.
hey! hey! that's a leave-in conditioner!
no, we're not.
and why aren't i at school?
dad, there's a note on the back of your head.
hm. "thanks for letting us crash in your pad. we had a very nice time."
korean love brides?!
yeah, i did see some bikers ride by here with a blue-haired woman, 'bout ten minutes ago. said they were gonna spend the night at crystal lake campground, section k, space 217. i'm sorry i can't be of more help.
homer, homer, stop it! we've given up our violent ways. we just want to live peacefully, with your wife.
fight! fight! fight! fight!
we both knew it would come to this.
take your wallet.
homer!
hey, can we at least keep her till the orgy in san berdoo?
no!
why are we stopping here?
sis-ters are doin' it for themselves!
oh, no! it's dad! 
uh, we're drunk. really drunk!
what will become of our kids?
i've got a motorhome i never use. maybe we should raffle it off.
what about mr. burns? maybe he'll help us out.
check it out. i'm breaking books at a sixth-grade level.
this broom closet is not what it seems. it's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot.
thus saving christmas.
yes. the madness ends here.
well, what do we have here? looks like the biggest rip-off since "webster."
no, bart, he's right. i did oversimplify.
well, there's something you don't see every christmas.
hey, dad... what if we...
cloning is a troubling issue.
well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the...
she cleaned out the attic!
/ push! /
i'll never get rid of this useless junk.
you guys never use any of this stuff. look at these. you bought them after the nagano olympics, and never skied once. if you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe...
yeah! let's go skiing! / yeah, dad. let's go!
look dad, it's the drummer from bread!
i'm sorry!
hi-didly-ho, schuss in boots.
well, it allows for maximum mobility. feels like i'm wearing nothin' at all!
feels like i'm wearin' nothin' at all. nothin' at all, nothin' at all...
have you been in here all day?
no wonder. look at this. that oughta hold it.
i can't be in the hospital! tomorrow is laundry day. and i've gotta de-meat lisa's baloney.
no they won't. we'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? guys...?
oh, really? well, knock yourself out. just don't expect any miracles from those two.
good lord! you're wasting thousands of dollars worth of interferon.
dad, where are your clothes?
don't tell me mom dresses you.
okay, now we're gonna draw jobs from the chore hat.
you know, the reason for the hat...
will you at least do the dishes?
oh! you're gonna be late. here are your lunches. and no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
you're dead, squealer.
no it's not!
good. maple soda?... a cell phone full of candy?... astronaut bread?
dad, i gave you a list!
oh, couldn't be better.
polo!
polo!
will you guys turn that thing down?
will this do?
ohh, i don't like the looks of this.
let's see... crusty sores...
... horrible wailing...
leprosy?! aahhh! unclean! unclean!
excellent.
now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. i'll get you a couple of mops.
at sunday school they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude. yeah, that sounds right.
brains... brains...
oh, those poor souls. what's the christian thing to do?
all right, food!
uh, listen, homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. i'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you.
whoa! this is a hospital?
ah, you must be the simpsons.
oh, you'll have a great view of the whole beach... from the electric needle room.
yes, from the electric needle room.
yeah, we know.
no way. we scored a free hawaiian vacation.
well, it all sounds lovely, but...
number one, report to the dermabrasion hut.
dad, you only took one course.
there's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party...
you went to springfield u. you hate a & m.
or a ski hat if you've got a picture of a girl.
does anybody need that much porno?
seal the exits. thank you, thank you. c'mon, hurry it up. all right now, let's empty our pockets.
professor rocco, chancellor knuckles?
we look like slobs.
my computer has 512 shades of red.
good evening, gentlemen.
i tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
oh, now don't fret. these days, the victims of comedy traumas -- or "traumedies" -- can still lead rich, full lives. sorry, but these guys crack me up.
okay. hang on, homer. two eye holes coming up!
homer, maybe i should drive.
wow! is there anything he can't do?
brother, i sense you are feeling trapped and desperate.
i have the power!
hallelujah!
what have you got so far?
that's nice, but maybe your homecoming float should have something to do with college.
i think godzilla's bigger than superman.
but church can be fun. no, really. it can be a crazy party, with clouds and lasers and miracles.
ah, ha, excuse me, neighbor... ah, yeah, i, i couldn't help but notice you, you picked pretty much all of my flowers.
oh-ho, true enough. but, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?
my thesaurus... you'll lose more than that. in preparation for the big game, springfield stadium has caught additional-seating-capacity fever.
a & m is gonna kick your ivy-covered butts!
whoa nelly, we have ourselves a barnburner here today! welcome to the 117th dust-up between the snortin' swine of springfield a & m and the springfield university nittany tide. ohhh, doctor! break out the hickory switch!
do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
wow! he should have his foot insured by lloyds of london!
now, ladies and gentlemen, pour a little cider on those peepers, 'cause here comes the half-time parade!
an overdue tribute to halftime itself! and as those lumbering ships of the gridiron sail off into our memories, the players return to the field.
then, what's this?
hey, look out! / look out!
just a simple yes or no.
i wagered a large sum on the performance of that scholar-athlete.
well he'd better, or else!
sorry, dad. i can't just magically cure a broken leg.
i know, is phony major. lubchenko learn nothing. nothing!
yes!
springfield community!
hey hey!
seat filler.
i can't help it if i donated the most blood. oh, i'm feeling kinda woozy.
you won a grammy.
homer, sit down.
oh, okay... let's see... i don't have a speech prepared, but uh, abra-cadaver... "thank you all so much. i love springfield, from the cuddliest infant to th... ... puppies... patriotism... bluebirds..." i'm not reading this drivel. this speech is over.
that's not an award, that's part of the set.
don't worry about a thing. we'll take good care of your house!
good lord! this bedroom is as big as our house!
seems a little wasteful.
i'm princess margaret!
mom! bart's making faces at me. i think.
this all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes. hmm, i know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?
stop that! cigars are for rich people and legendary comedians, like bill crosby and david letterson.
homer, did you jimmy open mr. burns' liquor cabinet?
stop swirling, homer!
homer, who are you calling?
well, don't run up mr. burns' phone bill.
homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. you're not a billionaire.
all i'm saying is don't get too comfortable. mr. burns will be back tomorrow.
party? no! no parties.
no partays, no shindigs, no keggers, no hootenannies, no mixers, no raves, no box socials...
how 'bout tuborg? the beer of danish kings.
now, you know i can't sell you no beer till two p.m., on accounta it's sunday.
when it gets to here, we can drink again.
sorry. two p.m. or you can steal a boat and sail out to international waters.
no, the ocean. once you get twelve miles out, there's no laws at all. that's where they held the tyson/secretariat fight.
oh no, you don't! i'm not going to let you trash mr. burns' yacht.
hey, there's another way to get on the boat!
the boat's going sideways!
well, could you at least give us rubbing alcohol for our wounds? hey. sucker. ow!
wow, you can do anything out here.
arrr, i now pronounce ya man and cow. please accept these illegal fireworks with my blessing. yarrr.
well, let's play it by ear.
uh, not really, no.
aye aye, captain.
navy seals are on the way.
how 'bout a tactical nuclear strike?
enough! get in the net.
some party, homer.
hey, you're in the net, too.
and now we will cut you loose. for liability purposes it is the ocean that will kill you, not us.
hey, what do you know? it floats.
what about the people on the bottom?
ugh. the foul stench of youth! well, let's see. ming vase on narrow column, not knocked down... priceless coins not used in vending machine... ... yes, not bad.
ah, it's good to be home.
bart, stop that! now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here.
shhh.
do you have a military i.d.?
homer, give him the fifty cents.
just go.
who are those pleasant old men?
but first we'd like to dip into our new cd...
don't worry, sir. we'll get to that one...
you get up every morning / to the alarm clock's warning / take the eight-fifteen into the city...
workin' overtime...
we just did!
homer, lisa's in that.
i can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.
zing!
excuse me. but i believe this family already had a horse, and the expense forced homer to work at the kwik-e-mart with hilarious consequences.
oh, my. ooh-hoo. it's going to cost us $500 a week to keep duncan!
at least you don't have to feed any of the stuff i bought at the fair. well, except the mop.
he's a diving horse. maybe he could dive for pearls.
hey, dad.
this horse is pretty fast. maybe we can race him.
dad, if we're gonna race duncan, shouldn't we hire a professional trainer?
really? i thought i was the only one.
what the...
you mean horseshoes?
you really think that horse can run a mile and a half?
duncan's really fast, dad. he was just intimidated by those other horses.
is that duncan?
ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!
you're quite a trainer, mr. simpson. care to join us for a beer in the jockey's lounge?
these are our real voices! we only talk like this on your surface world.
your renegade horse is making us frown!
your horse must lose!
just lose the stinkin' race!
we'll eat your brain.
you want me to lose the springfield derby? but you always taught me that winning was everything.
maybe. but if duncan wins the derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud.
huh?
could it be? in a bizarre twist, a horse is abusing a jockey. might this be the start of a terrifying planet of the horses? in this announcer's opinion, almost certainly yes. and away i go.
hey, need any help, homer?
we'll give you gold!
now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. everything we pack in, we pack out.
use this plastic bag.
ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to springfield.
they sound angry... and africanized.
the bird sanctuary -- they ruined it!
show us your boobs, show us your boobs.
that's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned.
hi-diddly-ho, pedal-to-the-metal-o-philes!
c'mon! somebody crash!
let's go! let's go! the dice! the dice! the dice! eight seconds! great job, boys!
we're going as fast as we can, ma -- hey, who are you?
and now, here's something for the guys...
well, i guess no one else wants a t-shirt!
you heard him, girls.
fire!
no, i really mean it, though. i mean if it was you that died, i would have been on her so fast...
now homey, you know, ned and the boys need us. and you know what that means.
and now, the good people at fan-demonium, as part of a generous settlement, will fire a 21-t-shirt salute.
now if there's anything, anything at all i can do to help out...
that's nice of you homer, but i think i'll just go to bed.
homer, this really isn't necessary...
hey, that's my sprinkler.
i just bought that...
aw, homer. you don't have to...
no, homer! i just need to talk.
i just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. i can't believe my last words to maude were "no foot-longs."
if i'd only been a gentleman and got the hot dogs myself, she'd still be here.
ah, you're right. i've just got to work through the grief. there's not gonna be an easy answer.
why are you taping flanders, dad?
do you even have a job anymore?
okay, i finished the gardening sequence.
dad, there are other wipes besides star-wipes.
oh, it's been a hard couple of months, but i feel like i've turned a corner.
tape?
is this a dating video?
so that's why you maced me.
homer!
oh i would date ned in a second, if i was a woman, or gay. he looks like a cuddler, that ned. i, i like that. i like to be held. i like to be pampered.
what are you doing, homer?
ewwww.
homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? it just feels way too soon.
got it.
homer, i'm having second thoughts. this feels so disloyal to maude.
you think she would?
sherlock holmes is a character.
you're darn right you are! and you've got lots of other great qualities, too.
what floozies? what are you talking...
homer, you help too.
you're watching pbs?!
do shut up?
me eyes! / oh, i'm scalded, i am!
classic. not hard to see why it's england's longest-running series. and today, we're showing all seven episodes.
sorry, but these thieves make me so damn mad! you know who you are. thieves!
and now, it's time to go back to "do shut up."
and the next twenty callers will get this album of museum noises. now your music room can sound just like... the metropolitan museum in new york -- outstanding.
you know, i've worked with so many legendary actors over the years who could be counted on to "phone it in". well, now it's your turn to phone it in -- your pledge, that is. please, please, we're only ten thousand dollars away from returning to our show.
dad, you don't have ten thousand dollars.
but, thanks to insta-trace, we've learned it's homer simpson, of 742 evergreen terrace.
our pledge-enforcement van will be at his house in moments.
they don't show police chases, do they?
well said, homer. and now, for the moment of generosity...
absolutely.
it's 12:15.
get in there.
you are on television. please play along. are you robbing me?
um... is there a problem, mr. simpson?
you don't have the money, do you homer?
and you thought you could stab your problems away?
silly goose. why didn't you say so? get 'im, boys.
oh, why did i teach him that word?
ellmeaux knows where you live.
the word is "drive."
we'll send you someplace safe till the heat dies down.
homer, how would you like to be a missionary in the south pacific?
sorry, no can do.
no, no. you can even keep in touch with him on this ham radio.
welcome aboard, brother! you must be homer! i'm craig, that's amy. well, see ya.
first of all, forget everything you learned in missionary school.
don't let the bed bugs bite. seriously.
welcome, reverend homer. we look forward to learning about the bible from you.
we can not read.
are you enjoying your ox testicle?
really? you sure you wouldn't rather have a coconut? they're delicious.
oh, we call that . sorry, fish bone in my throat. we call that "earthquake."
i am oovilu-eeoo-kitana-wanjay.
craig and amy were also building a chapel.
i told you we should have asked them.
t...v?
cou-ouch?
oh, god. oh, god. oh, god! oh, god!
hello? is there anybody in there?
homer, are you all right?
you've only been gone two days.
i just don't think it's funny!
dad?
i just want to tell you how proud i am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
oh, yes. the whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. ned flanders is green with envy.
dad, are you licking toads?
oh, god! oh, god! oh, god!
amy said there are lots of religions. which is the right one?
um, if the lord is all powerful, why does he care whether we worship him or not? ak just saying...
ooh, tell us all you know about nuclear power.
i am ak.
the lucky savage?
yes, sir. number six.
homer, i'm so impressed. everything you're doing sounds so rewarding.
how can ace be one and eleven? huh? what kind of god would allow that?
why are you building chapel?
since when?
no, really.
don't panic! don't panic! don't panic!
you set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
now, which one of you is our designated driver?
okay, our first event qualifies for course credit at dartmouth college -- trick pouring!
now our final round, which counts for ninety-eight per cent of the total score, making the previous rounds a complete waste. don't forget, today's winner will be immortalized on our new duff calendar.
when i get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.
those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. and if bart gets a wowwipop, i want a wowwipop.
oh, boy!
i can't believe they put those stickers over my face. i must be the ugliest man alive.
the little rat eyes...
or be with.
beautiful.
homer, did you hear that? she called me handsome. me. it's like i've gone to heaven... wait a minute. i died on the operating table, didn't i?
so this is all real?
yeah, hello yourself. i'm moe szyslak. back in high school, i asked you to the springtime pumpkin dance, and you turned me down. well, i just wanted to show you the face that you coulda been kissin'.
apology? uh, geez, i wasn't expecting that... uh...
okay, last stop. channel 6.
i've been waiting all my life for this moment. homer, whoa, whoa, homer. change of plans.
hey, there are women in our bar!
ah, i'm a little busy, homer. ah, you can pour it yourself.
i didn't bring you back to life so you could make a fool of me at the club.
i've dedicated my life to diseases of the head holes. but the one hole i've never been able to fix is the one in my soul.
yeah, hey, i gotta gift. as a child, i was bitten by the acting bug. then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. now those eggs are hatching. and i... the feeling is indescribable.
"top secret story lines?!" uh, i'll sign for it. eh, might as well have a little peek... hmm. looks like my character gets back together with that evil contessa.
precisely. then i get in a skydiving accident and have to be rushed to the... graveyard?! they're killing off dr. tad winslow!
well, how could i say no to such a captivating...
whoa, it's the door.
why, who are you?
and what do you have to tell us, oh, angel of the future?
how tragic. tell me more.
ooh, that's unexpected. what else?
stickin' it to you for killin' off my character!
nah, it's just as well. that handsome face was nice, but it was too much maintenance. i had to wash it, rub it with neat's-foot oil... you did me a favor, homer. and to think i was about to sell the bar to hooters...
folks, you're gonna want to turn around. the bugs are firmly in charge.
please, just go! they've taken the visitors' center! they, they ate the comment book!
hey, an indian casino!
homer, you know i had a gambling problem.
ah, something troubles me about indian gaming. on the one hand, the revenue helps the tribes...
yeah, but i really wanna...
yo, it's me.
don't you mean present?
isn't that made of people?
hey, dad. my band finally got a break. i just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock. how about a little loanski?
but i want some.
what happened to you, man? you used to be cool.
nah, you've changed, man.
don't you think we should wait for lisa? she is the president.
dad, that's just a myth. lincoln didn't hide any gold in the white house.
wait! how do you know this is where lincoln buried the gold? you just started counting from an arbitrary place.
your plan makes no sense.
gold bars discovered by homer?
"dear countryman: you have come in search of my gold, and i will not disappoint you."
my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american.
it's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..." well, isn't that clever? it's a metaphor.
i can't believe it only comes fifty-two times a year.
looks like milhouse's mom finally threw out his "blanky." he'll pay a lot to get this back.
dad, that's a sports bra.
look, dad. barber hair. ooo, italian.
behold, i am king talkie-tiki!
do not anger talkie-tiki! i am all-power--
what are you, nuts?
mr. gumbel, you're upsetting me.
well, i'm off to market...
oh, i'm a disgrace.
i'll show you. i'm gonna take these helicopter lessons.
i knew you'd be back. santeria, you're the greatest!
i know, but it's so hard. please help me, homer.
i feel for you, pally. but, uh, you want a.a. -- this is triple a.
east st. louis?
ah, welcome back, homer. i see you've finally hit rock bottom.
well, your recovery begins today. and we promise you all the sugar cookies and second-hand smoke you can handle.
they're on that table over there.
hey, homer. ah, no, no, no, don't sit there. take this seat, right next to the tap.
yeah, someone who makes our alcoholism seem less raging.
see, homer? it's not so bad. now dance, rummy!
you danced for hours just because they told you to?
wanna go for a ride?
whoops, sorry. when i think about all the time i wasted at moe's...
those are all priceless memories, homer, but i don't want to do that stuff anymore.
i didn't say that.
oh, don't be that way, homer.
so how was your ride with barney?
cheer up, homie. you don't need friends to be happy. i haven't had a friend in years.
well, you still have lenny and carl.
well, if barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. old friends stick together, like o.j. and a.c., or the falcon and the snowman.
oh, hello homer.
beer, huh?
enjoy.
then we agree.
i will.
good day, then.
ta.
now dance, rummy!
hiya, moe.
this is a channel six news bulletin. fire has broken out on mount springfield, trapping two youngsters and their camera.
i can't. i've never flown solo!
i know, i know! i haven't learned right turns yet.
i can't do this! my nerves are shot! beer. that's what i need.
yes! i need it!
you can't drink 'em all.
you brave man. you took six silver bullets for me.
dad!
hang on! i'll throw you a ladder!
dad, help!
you did it, dad!
no, you saved our lives.
well, i'm glad we're friends again.
a double tall mocha latte.
here's the mail, dad. that'll be three dollars for on-couch delivery.
this isn't real money. it's printed by the montana militia.
i'm betting it's hunger and rage.
dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. you're supposed to open the magazine.
why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
well, it was a little insensitive giving me a sex test, seeing that my wife just passed away.
six months ago. you were at the funeral. you fell into the grave.
no, no, no, nick. he's so good to his mother.
homie, for god's sakes, it's two a.m.
i don't know. i'm trying to sleep.
now what's wrong?
well, maybe you added it wrong. let me add it...
oh, honey, don't panic. if you just made a few lifestyle changes...
maybe you should see a doctor, homie. a head doctor.
the crisis? charlie bluhdorn's birthday. the solution? a snappy banner. out comes the phone, in flies bobby towne. and six drafts later, i had myself a party.
well, we've got a soloflex down at h.q. anyway, everything looks great, mr. burns. i can't find a single violation or employee acting strangely.
of course not. he's just a harmless maniac, here to remind us of the precious gift of sanity. b... oh, god! what's he doing?
you hate your father, don't you?
i shouldn't have brought that up. i was just venting. anyhoo, i think your fear of death is causing your insomnia, which is provoking your erratic behavior.
because it's made of plastic.
what you need is a good, long rest. i suggest florida.
quiet, you two! you know your father's had a breakdown.
take 'em off the glass! take 'em off the glass! this looks like a terrible place to relax. we're gonna get you to a-- 
i trust you, honey. sweet dreams.
what up, chew toys? cienega here, tightenin' the hose clamps for ya bad girls! we got kid rock comin' up for all you mosh monkeys.
yo, yo, straight out of detroit, y'all, it's the j-o-e to the c! let's rock the party with kid rock!
my name is kiiiidddd kid rock!
thank you! it's the pimp of the nation, kid rock, tearin' it up at spring break, y'all! now, what we'd like to do next is bring it down for a minute.
but this ain't no forty-ounce curb. so, we're gonna need forty gallons, y'all!
yo, let's waste that biatch!
no, sir... please don't tell mama.
oh, thank goodness. where were you?
nah, boys will be boys. i reckon he was just blowin' off a little steam.
the world looks to us -- the college students -- for leadership.
dad, look out!
the gi-ant gator!
you killed captain jack! you in a heap o' trouble, son.
you see, during spring break the beer companies pay me to look the other way. the rest of the year, i'm a real hardass. okay, sweet pea, you're next. whoa, looks like we got a teeny houdini here. well don't you worry, darlin'. i got some baby-cuffs in the station.
you can't drive, dad. he's got your license.
pull over!
there's lots of good places! what about over there?
homer no. you'll kill us all.
dad, what do we do?!
hey, where is dad?
you went to the snack car?
this family has hit a new low. we're on the run from the law, totally lost, no car, no money, no clean clothes... and it's all your fault.
a diner!?
i like your honesty. you're hired. and you two haven't said a word. i like that. you're hired.
no thanks.
y'all just lie low here. you'll be safe with ol' velma. stop that.
scat.
go on now.
too hot to bicker, i reckon.
got that right. / durn tootin'. / boy howdy.
you mean, when they marry other people.
you just relax. i'll have you in jail by supper time.
well, first up is the state of florida vs. the simpson family.
no listening. you hear me?
simpson, we got a problem. the jazz pianist didn't show up.
well, looks like you folks are free to go. but don't you set foot in the state of florida again.
well, we're still welcome in north dakota and arizona.
i can streamline any procedure, except this thing you call "love."
homer, sitting that close to the tv can't be good for you.
you should get your eyes checked. i'm taking bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
i love you, daddy.
we need something quick. my husband's eyes are really shot.
dad, i've got maggie.
okay, let's get started. hey, wake up.
now, read the first line.
better or worse?
that pair is popular with celebrities like val kilmer...
and yoko ono...
maybe you're a candidate for laser eye surgery.
well yes, but i must warn you, it's an experimental procedure and we still don't know the long-term effects...
wait! you've gotta use these drops. they prevent your eyes from crusting over.
now homie, when we get to the liquor store, buy me some jack daniels and a carton of smokes.
why does it have a picture of vitamin barn?
and you will be a dancer.
and you look adorable.
but i just... need more practice. see ya!
where's lisa?
there she is! hi, honey! wow, look at her go.
stop clapping!
oh, thanks, dad.
see, honey? all you needed was to believe in...
i was merely trying to spare the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.
forget it, dad. i guess i'm never gonna be your broadway baby.
sure. it could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
uh-oh. it's out of its matrix. nobody move.
homer, look, we're invited to otto's wedding! ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. zig-zag!?
no knife games on the kitchen table!
dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!
becky, what have i done here? i'm so sorry.
becky, i know you must feel awful. but at least this didn't happen after you were married.
bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?
actually, that was becky, too.
well, nobody's perfect. let me just pick those out.
be right back.
awww. / oh, no.
i'm not insane!
shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
the kids are saying if you say bloody margie five times, she'll appear. but then she gouges your eyes out.
oh. well, then, i guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. except you cutting my brakes!
mom!
oh, i've got too much to do to take a nap right now. lisa, get maggie out of that cage. and homer, since you're dressed for it, i got some s & m for ya: scrubbing and mopping.
... onto the sands of superstar bay. but behind the chortles, this funny fivesome was trapped in a private hell.
nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. they almost drove me to fortified wine!
i'd see 'em sittin' on that couch all day long... just starin' at that hollywood hogwash.
home improvement...
and shit he did. using his home as the studio, and his family as the cast, this penniless peckinpah shot a crude five-minute video.
i haven't done the laundry yet.
dad, that's too much deterge--
simp-son!!! where's my dinner?!
okay, the material was a little corny, but homer and i had real chemistry onscreen.
the simpsons had their foot in the door. fox ordered thirteen episodes. but would the public respond?
r-u-p-e-r...
...-t.
the funniest stuff came right out of real life.
dad, i've never said "cowabunga!" in my life. your script sucks.
hey, that's funny!
right, and the award for "best hardcore thrashmetal" goes to... "simpsons' christmas boogie"?! for america's favorite family, everything was coming up roses... but those roses contained ready-to-sting bees. when we come back...
the script originally called for me to jump the gorge. but i'd been up all night paying people to kiss, so dad volunteered to do the stunt.
the sequence became an instant comedy classic. but what the audience didn't see was the unfunny aftermath... somehow, homer became addicted to painkillers. it was the only way he could perform the bone-cracking physical comedy that made him a star.
the tax men were merciless.
dad, i want to go to bed. aren't there child labor laws?
something that swings, with the beat of new orleans.
swings!
sadly, this argument was not part of the act.
oh, that's it!
got a brother named billy / and my teeth look silly / break it down now!
but now the wing was on fire... and the prayer had been answered by satan. after the state fair fiasco... none of the family were speaking to each other. fox put the show on hiatus, and replaced it with hidden camera footage from the dressing room at ann taylor.
as a young female artist, i really love living in this east village loft. oh, that must be our new landlord, mr. stingeley.
that's assault! that is assault.
thank you, taco, for that loving tribute to falco. and now, to present the award for "most violent rap group," homer simpson!
and marge simpson!
the simpsons' bitter past was forgotten, and now the future looks brighter than ever for this northern kentucky family.
so you know it's great.
i can't believe it. we won another contest!
i don't like you ogling her. why don't you read "cathy"? she's hilarious.
what?!
maybe i'd better check mine. "today, your husband will die." homer, i'm scared.
yeah, it's quite fetching, but, uh, aren't you worried about the deadliness?
no dessert until you eat your broccoli.
sure is easy when they're stiff like this. and very sad.
i wouldn't celebrate so soon, mr. simpson. i don't see a single good deed next to your name.
homer, settle down. i'll give you a chance to get into heaven. you have twenty-four hours to go back and do one good deed.
it's a miracle! thank heavens!
oh, i'm so sorry, i wasn't looking.
no, you're thinking of santa claus.
silence, sinner! prepare for an eternity of horrible pain!
oh, it's not so bad... ow! i just got over the plague.
maybe you could be a dunce, father.
hey!
but husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?
what?! you threw our precious babies into the woods?! we could have sold them! go back and get them!
that's it! into the oven with you! 
father, i knew you'd rescue us!
uh, hello, i'm george cauldron. is suzanne ready yet?
speaking of which, how about seconds?
uh, di... did i say "killer dolphins"? i meant killer italians. gray, bottle-nosed, intelligent italians.
those dolphins seem bent on mayhem. we've gotta warn grampa.
that was you?!
i, i, i tuned out. where we goin'?
oh, no. you poor thing. here...
if i could just... this is really not... you're hurting my...
ha ha ha ha ha. 
no, there's a badger in there.
tons.
no, dad! we don't want to kill him! let's call animal control.
how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?
your call cannot be completed as dialed. please make sure you have the correct area code.
the phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939.
geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers.
i'm not sure which one's better. the 6 is closer to the 3, so you've got convenience there, but the 9 has less to do with satan, which is a plus in this religious world of ours.
don't forget the leaflets they dropped from the space shuttle. and the two weeks we all spent at area code camp.
... 0, 1, 1... aaannnd 3.
ahoy hoy.
congratulations, you're gonna rendezvous with the who!
you should call that radio station and let 'em have it.
... has been replaced by the convenience of two area codes.
it's a movie, dad.
i like it.
i never!
/ he's right. / we're gettin' it but good.
what are you pathetic slobs gonna do about it?
it worked on the test-corpse.
viva la revolución!
say, i couldn't help but overhear. i represent the arizona cardinals...
yeah, maybe you oughta be mayor of new springfield.
the mayor... starring homer simpson.
presenting our new plaque. i say the time for bitterness has passed. let us extend to our brothers in new springfield the olive branch of...
go ahead and laugh! we have a better town bird!
the bluebird.
more wheat cakes, mr. mayor?
dad, you got syrup on your sash.
if you ask me...
... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. it would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
that's not true.
as expected, new springfield's bold experiment in slob rule is a disaster.
scientists say they are also less attractive physically. and while we speak in a well-educated manner, they tend to use lowbrow expressions, like "oh yeah?" and "c'mere a minute."
you c'mere a minute.
dad, i don't think this is such a good idea.
in retaliation for the power outage, olde springfield patriots have intercepted a beer truck bound for new springfield and dumped all the beer in the river.
i don't know. vengeance is pretty good.
we can't go on fighting with olde springfield. these people are our neighbors. we see them every day.
like the one in berlin?
homer...
'bout what?
bye homer.
well, dad, you're mayor of a ghost town.
dad, you're bleeding.
don't give up, dad. maybe we can get the who to play here instead.
can i help you?
dad, the chloroform!
oh, yeah, right. i got fired by the who. whatever you say, pal. wack-o...
yeah, we don't want to lose our pool privileges.
the mayor of new springfield?
the crazy mayor of new springfield?
sacred bond.
we know our songs, homer.
we'll do it. just send a cab for us.
we were expecting a bigger crowd.
and we don't know "pacman fever."
give us back our concert, simpson!
daily?
all right, enough chit chat. let's see how ya like flaming garbage!
uh, says you.
okay, we'll play "magic bus" if you tear down this wall.
oh hell, i'll do it myself...
hey, we just took care of that dangerous melon that was threatening our garden.
or is it?
i said, or is it?
homer, what are you doing?!
ooo, baby.
what's going on here?
oh, yeah? you didn't blow up maggie's room.
you've ruined all my stuff.
well, the book festival starts today...
mmmm.
homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip.
catch, dad, catch!
mm, i think i've found my mentor. you know, homer, i've spent my whole life entertaining kids, and i just realized i don't know the first thing about 'em.
dad! dad!
daaaad!
my little girl's sharp as a tack. i tried the "got your nose" bit on her -- didn't fool her for a second.
fold-o-rama.
no.
oh yeah, right. just let me go to my car.
i'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering.
oh, krusty. i'm sure she just needs time to get used to you.
my daughter's violin!
really? you'd help me take on the mob?
it's some kinda mafia summit! every mob family in the country's here: the cuomos, the travoltas, the lasordas, the boy-ar-dees...
it's gonna take forever to go through all these!
then it's decided. our website name will be crime dot org.
that's him! that's the one! homer simpson!
oh, all right. / fair enough. / he's a class act.
well, maybe i should.
i guess.
don't you call me a--
oh, how cute! kids, look who's on the roof!
i can't believe how young he is. he'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.
shut up!
you're welcome to come, too.
they've undergone terrible hardships.
mom, dad, there's something i have to do. you're not gonna like it, but i really believe it's the right thing.
it's okay, mom! i have a safety line!
this was her choice, mr. simpson.
dad, i'm not dead!
homer, it's neddy. i baked you a little something to ease the pain.
homer, ah, booze is on the house, seeing as how lisa is, ah,... how do i put this... uh, ridin' the midnight train to slab city.
dear moe, if anything should ever happen to me, i want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... dad, i can't--
i'm not dead! and neither is my sense of moral outrage.
not my company! 
just a cotton-pickin' minute. i've been getting a's since gymboree.
you gave bart one.
i just buckled down and studied.
deadbeat. deadbeat. deadbeat.
they're getting away / stop them, mary-kay!
va la bamba / va la bamba...
no, no. your playing, while technically proficient, lacks passion.
when did this happen? when did we become the bottom rung of society?
dad, what happened to the back seat?
maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
mr. simpson, you're a dollar overdrawn.
well, i see you have several mortgages, credit card debt, no savings, and you're supporting your father?
i couldn't ask you to do that.
based on these figures, i'm afraid you'll need to declare bankruptcy... several times. just look at this projection.
mr. simpson, your intelligence profile indicates that you're too "stupid" to stick to a budget.
so let me put this simply: you need more money.
oh, i concur. word-a-day calendar.
hmmm. what is this? some kind of force-field around these vegetables.
everything's so green and alive!
what kind of a raise?
i see. you have thirty seconds to wow me.
i don't want to hear your whining. i'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!
oh, for the love of... hurl this at that.
well, let's decorate him then.
not even for four dollars?
that was capital - my lung is aching.
do it again! i'll make it an even eight.
let's keep the laughs coming, eh, simpson? what say i make you my executive in charge of recreation -- no, no, better yet, my prank monkey.
i can't have my little monkey running around in rags.
look at that comic book fellow calmly eating candy like a spaniard. time for monkey to shine.
and i'd like an hour on the holodeck with seven of nine. saturn's rings! let me get that for you. paper bag, or triple mylar?
oh, that was uproarious. first-rate job, monkey!
okay, now!
the line in the lady's room is far too long and so i hope you don't mind if i...
there. that's six years' worth of inoculations.
oh, yes, sir!
homie, where did you get that ball of money?
really? like what?
look at their proud, hopeful faces. wait'll they see that their rare chinese panda is nothing but a fat guy in a suit.
oh, she's saying "i love you."
hey, there's our resident bull panda, ping ping. with any luck, folks, these two will become very, very close, if you know what i mean.
hah. you ain't goin' nowhere, cutie.
dad?? the panda was you?
so, this is your mysterious new job for mr. burns?
oh dad, you have to stop.
well done, monkey! that other panda gave some unexpected zazz to the festivities, eh?
too busy trying to keep my sides from splitting -- it's happened before. monty say, monkey do. what could be better?
oh, shut up, you tub of guts.
not my dad.
dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?
take that back for nine hundred and three dollars.
da-ad!
well, well, it looks like my monkey has evolved into a man. a poor man.
forget about him, dad. i'm proud of you.
well, there's lots of needy kids out there...
no, dad. you could really brighten the holidays for those less fortunate.
yessss?
why, i don't think i've ever seen such generosity. you're a modern-day kris kringle, sir.
say no more. i had a bit of a shoe-sniffing problem myself. i'm still not allowed on the third floor.
wanna rehearse, dad?
christmas.
prepare to be boarded!
not for one million dollars?
oh, dad. you sold your soul.
what's going on?
didn't you get the e-mail?
or a quiet phone call.
why not? anything goes today.
hmmm, well, do you need a paperweight? because if you buy that machine, that's all you're gonna have. is an expensive paperweight.
mm-hm. that technology is three months old. only suckers buy out of date machines. you're not a sucker, are you, sir?
oh, good, because if you were i would have to ask you to leave the store.
you'll need a top of the line machine for that. that's the same computer astronauts use to do their taxes.
of course you were.
you only have ten seconds to decide, sir.
dad, you shouldn't drag that around.
did i hear my name? my ears are burnin'.
ah, you're busy. catch you later, compu-tater.
dad, i'll set up your computer. why don't you and bart go play in the back yard?
okay, you're ready to go. i've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them.
homer, bring that back in the house.
you have chosen no, meaning you've committed a crime, but don't want to confess. a paddy wagon is now speeding to your home.
while you wait, why not buy a police cap or t-shirt? you have the right to remain fabulous!
i got suspended from school today.
i took a swing at a cop.
i'm just mad all the time.
mom wants you to come to bed.
you have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea...
i heard mayor quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.
nelson.
you can't post that on the internet. you don't even know if it's true.
you know, it might've been jimbo.
good lord! we've discovered the ruins of an ancient city! okay, you do better.
do you want turkey sausage or ham?
a new internet watchdog is creating a stir in springfield. mr. x, if that is his real name, has come up with a sensational scoop.
i'm happy you got the potholes filled, but it's still irresponsible to present rumors as facts. maybe you should quit while you're ahead.
eh, who am i to point the finger? i once ran over a guy in a parking lot, and dumped the body on a golf course.
the public should be warned. i wish mr. x were here.
are you him? are you mr. x?
uh, but you talked in that real sly voice. hey, hey, everybody, homer's mr. x!
are you?
well, if mr. x were here right now, i'd buy him a tall frosty.
no.
no.
oh, pshaw.
let go of me! i'm innocent!
unfortunately, we don't know who he is. so his cash award will be used to feed starving children.
he is mr. x! hah!
i'm proud that you won the pulitzer...
but i do feel bad about the starving children...
so hungry.
well, you can't post news if you don't have any.
at least take off your pulitzer prize when you say that.
oh, dad...
hey, mr. x! i got a tip for ya. in science class, they're dissecting frozen hoboes. and i have the bindles to prove it.
this is... the island.
oh, no one leaves the island.
because you know something.
see you tomorrow.
i'm number 15. what number are you?
yes, well done.
well, they keep us here because we know too much. number 27 there knows how to turn water into gasoline. number 12 knows the deadly secret behind tic-tacs. and i invented the bottomless peanut bag.
i don't know.
hello, number 5. how's every little thing?
fair enough, i'll level with you. ow. please. don't do that.
i'll be blunt. your web page has stumbled upon our secret plan.
oh don't be cute. i'm referring to the flu shot exposé. you see, we're the ones loading them with mind-controlling additives.
to drive people into a frenzy of shopping. that's why flu shots are given just before christmas.
yes it is. and we can't have you out there mucking it up now, can we?
there's a good boy. let's get you some ice cream. there you are.
i wouldn't count on that, number 5. as far as your family knows, homer simpson is walking in the front door right about now.
psst.
sorry, old chap. but you're proving quite the caterpillar in our buttermilk.
we're shutting you down.
that arranged can be.
yes, fight and struggle!
can i turn this off?
the dog thinks so, too.
once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place.
welcome to the magic palace.
hello, i'm questo. i'll be your waiter and mentalist for this evening. i'm receiving a drink order... something foamy... is it a beeee...?
don't worry, marge. you won't feel a thing. you'll feel four things.
cool! a gift shop. "ages 8 to 80." hmm... that's me! dad, will you get me this magic kit?
hmmm. well, there's your problem.
ooh, well, ah, that's a foreign fish we're lookin' at... so, uh, sixty-five hundred. plus three-fifty.
maybe i can make some money, dad. my magic act is really coming along.
oh, my goodness!
oh, no! i could never support the black arts.
hey, you guys... you're in our spot!
dad, only one of them is real.
hey, don't blame me. i gotta compete with tv, and the internet.
yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's little league games!
well, i showed up for all your stupid interventions.
hey, homer! check it out!
yeah, i know a little place.
people. i guess they thought i was a charity case.
but wouldn't that make us con artists?
so in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe.
sounds good. wanna eat my fat?
this book has all the classic cons. there's "the pigeon drop," "the ear wigger," "the brillstein grab..."
well, there's the "albany ham scam."
what are you doing? why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
should i just back out of the room?
okay, dad. ready for our first con?
nice use of the lingo, homer.
sir, it was my fault.
no, no, no. i'll pay for the cake.
wow, look at all this loot! what should we buy first?
there you are. how was the magic act?
or so it would seem...
i just gotta get him back!... or if not him, a similar dog...
how much for the dog?
dad?
why are we still grifting? the car's paid for. doesn't that balance out the universe?
okay, i'm sold.
oh, no, homer, remember? maudie got called up to heaven.
what?
why, there's my name in gold.
amateurs!
that's right.
yeah, in the depression, you had to grift. either that, or work.
oh, why not? if we don't take their money, they'll just give it to some televangelist.
i'm abe simpson.
i can't believe it! i can finally afford a young, crazy stripper wife. yeah, i'm gonna get me the craziest, strippiest...
oh, this is terrible. now who do we give the money to?
forget it, ed. do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head.
call me mint jelly, 'cause i'm on the lam!
well, this is about the flashiest car i've ever impounded.
please, fbi man, don't throw us in jail. we just made one mistake.
hmm... okay, tell you what. i'll let you turn yourselves in. maybe they'll go easier on you.
well, i did ruin the boy's birthday cake. go on in. but i'll be watching.
okay, we're all locked up now...
that's not an fbi badge.
that guy was a grifter!
you were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
what did he look like?
anything else?
oh, dear. we don't want that.
homie! homie, wake up! they've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!
i didna do it, i tell ya.
what do you care, loner?
dad, willie got arrested 'cause of us!
dad, we've got to tell everyone the truth.
mr. simpson, could you describe your assailant to the court?
dad! tell them!
daa-ad!
willie! as your employer, i insist that you...
wait a minute. this whole thing was a set-up?!
yeah, we hornswoggled you good.
he's doing "dreamcoat" at the dinner theater.
willie wasn't!
well, i'm gonna take the broncos in this game. 'cause the packers will be blinded by jerry's tie.
well, folks, he's got a point. uh, with all our unscripted horseplay, we sometimes don't think about...
yeah, they really hurt that guy's feelings.
ready for the circus, homer?
the cirque de purée. we've had tickets since septembre.
finally, a circus full of whimsy and wonder.
as french canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment.
but i cannot help you. i am just a local merchant from, uh... this town.
mesdames et messieurs, it appears the cloud goddess is ripe with rain babies. we must run for our trucks.
oh, stop. your father and i don't get the day off. lenny says we've got the day off! yippee!
this is terrible. how will the kids get home?
well, i'm all for rescuing the kids, but i wish you hadn't sawed off my roof.
but it's my car.
sure you did -- "mr. plow." you're wearin' the jacket right now!
oh! i think we hit something.
catchy song, all right. you really wrote it?
stupid ice. i always knew i would die caked in something. well, better turn off that engine. before those fumes put us in tombs.
homer! wake up! the car's filling with...
just like the one that saved ezekiel!
now let's go save those kids.
we're gonna crash!
gotcha!
and the exhaust pipe is leaking.
ignore her, effendi. we have each other.
i don't know what's in 'em. i just know i can't stop smokin' 'em. 
folks, you're about to witness the exciting new process of motion-capture animation.
now, when we activate the suite, our furry friend will copy you exactly.
that would be the world's funniest marsupial.
uh, sir, this is a joint account. uh, you'll, need your wife's signature, too.
here's your candy.
uh, sir? your life savings.
okay... uh, now, before i execute this order, are you sure you understand the risks of stock ownership?
for automated stock prices, please state the company name.
animotion. up one and one-half.
yahoo. up six and a quarter.
homer!
turning to the stock market, animotion is up an eighth...
... after plunging seventy-five points this morning.
are you crazy?! i'm not going to be a surrogate mother.
you know, homer, i got a great way to make money -- i'm a human guinea pig.
oh, oh, right, okay.
ow! not so loud.
first, we'll test this experimental perfume on you.
homer, you really have no desire to eat that food?
he must've brought it in with him.
mr. simpson, i'm afraid you have a crayon lodged in your brain.
do you have any idea how this might have happened?
mr. simpson, this could be responsible for your subnormal intelligence.
we could remove the crayon for you. it could vastly increase your brain power... or it could possibly kill you.
oh, homer, where have you been?
really?
do you feel smarter?
i don't believe it. say something else smart.
i'd love to go to the library with you.
dad, did you read all these books today?
i always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.
oooh, found a new short cut?
welcome to the third lecture in our series on "not putting things up your nose." please welcome homer simpson.
question!
a moron says what?
haw haw!
whatcha mailin', homer?
how come you're not giving it to mr. burns?
yeah, it's nice to have someone with brains in this nuclear plant. homer's the guy who rigged up my pants with this special codpiece.
i can't feed my family with a codpiece.
burn! burn! burn!
don't tell me how to feel.
you ain't welcome here no more, smart boy.
dad, as intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. in fact, i made a graph. i make a lot of graphs.
oh, many things: tai chi, chai tea... but i find, when i can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk.
is that your final answer?
wait a minute! somebody's not laughing here. it's him!
... ably played by bill paxton.
point out your plot holes elsewhere!
i'm sorry. we don't play god here.
look, what if we gave you the name of an unlicensed surgeon?
so whaddaya want here? uh, appendectomy, lipo, or the "sampler"? that's very popular.
all right, tell me when i hit the sweet spot.
all right, all right.
that's pretty dumb... but uh...
sweetheart, a missing crayon could be anywhere.
dad, how could you? we were connecting in such a meaningful way.
"lisa: i'm taking the coward's way out. but before i do, i just want you to know: being smart made me appreciate how amazing you really are." oh, dad.
homer, get up! up, up, up! oh no!
sorry, homie, but you promised to take me to the apron expo today.
they're unveiling a combination apron/smock. it's called a "smapron."
no, "smapron."
and this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.
i'm a little disappointed. there were too many aprons.
somebody help him!
hey! hey, over here! here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!
da-ad!
how's your back, homie?
naw, that's for the prisoners. you can complain all you want.
try to focus on something else. umm... you like jimi hendrix, right?
well, look at that painting. wow. the artist really captured jimi's passion and intensity.
you kiddin'? look, he painted a unicorn in outer space. i'm askin' you, what's it breathin'?
ain't no air in space.
how's your back, dad?
oh, nothing... how would you feel if i did some volunteer work at the prison?
oh, homie. i knew you'd support me.
your spine is more twisted than sinbad's take on marriage.
oh, i'd love to. but, ah, to be honest, modern medicine has a lousy record of treating the back. we spend too much time on the front.
i'm gonna send you to my chiropractor.
hello, homer. i'm doctor steve. please lie down.
now homer, we don't actually "crack" backs. it's merely an adjustment. okay, you're gonna hear a loud cracking sound. there we go.
i'm just yankin' your chain. i'm jewish.
did you do those exercises he gave you?
dad! are you okay?
that trash can must have unkinked your back.
okay, okay.
you remember jack... he's that talented painter who had a little brush with the law.
so, homer, you think you can fix my sciatica?
i'm limp. hey, it worked! my searing leg pain is now a gentle numbness.
simpson, you're not a licensed chiropractor. and you're stealing patients from me and dr. steffi!
you've been warned. stop chiropracting.
careful, i'm frail.
excuse me, sir. is this el clínico magnífico?
we'd, uh, like to invest in your spinal adjustment device.
we'll need to take some photographs.
c'mon, c'mon, let's go!
hey dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box.
i'll call poison control. fran, it's me. just a heads-up.
hey, where's my melon? and you are banned for life from all of my performances and tv specials.
ooh, it says here that special effects whiz tom savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!
i can't believe i'm gonna miss that!
how could you have it planned out? you just heard about the problem.
you two are not welcome.
thanks for the tip-off.
good evening. sorry... i-i had a really big dinner...
sure, computer technology is here to stay. but there'll always be a place for the practical special effects wizard.
get out and take your sacajawea dollars with you. i'll give ya till "three." one... hey homer, who's the manatee?
nobody badmouths duff! uh, piece o' crap.
so many restaurants...
umm... i guess i'll, i'll have the chicken tandoori.
you know what else scares me? everything!
oh.
hmm. well, this autopsy coupon appears to be valid. what other funerary services may we provide for the pre-deceased?
sir, we prefer the term "casket" to "coffin." and "monument" to "tombstone." we have all the leading brands of anti-stink spray.
heh, heh, heh. look at 'im go.
of course! this is the "contempo."
ooh, bury me over here. pleeeease?
hear that? if you cheapskate me into hell, i'll haunt you good. imagine this when you're sittin' on the john:
o-kay, with mole insurance, your total comes to... seventeen thousand dollars.
or, you could just toss him in the woods and let the wolves carry him off. it's really up to you.
yesss?
sir, if i may, think of it as an investment in extravagance. the mauso-palooza can be seen from space. it will consume as much cement as a regulation-size tennis court.
oh, i can't believe we went through all that, just to wind up with a tennis court.
you don't care what happens to me when i die.
practicing tennis.
foxy boxing?
you know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. i hear mel brooks has one. i mean, sir mel brooks.
and it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
hey, you got a tennis court.
will do.
we win again!
match point.
that's game, set, and match to us. but the real winners here are marge's hors d'oeuvres.
i guess you could say, "i'm iraqi!"
especially bonnets.
will you get serious, homer? i'd like to win at least once.
hey, homer. here's a bloopie for ya.
you'll never guess what i heard in the supermarket today. i found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
i thought our tennis court was bringing us a little respectability. instead, people make fun of our lousiness.
all of that is you. you've gotta take this more seriously.
no, it's a smooth motion... you follow through with your racket.
what? we're not ready to compete!
get 'em off! get 'em off!
oh, that's okay. bart's doing fine. you just have another beer.
i don't know what this has to do with the civil war.
oh. hi dad.
i am playing in the tournament.
i've got a partner.
oh, hello, homer.
uh, there's something i should tell you.
well, actually, the name of bart's partner is...
i'm bart's partner.
oh, i'm sorry, homie. we'll talk about it later, okay?
oh, homey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings.
i just wanted to win for once. please don't take it as a threat to your manhood.
we can wipe out b.c. in our lifetime.
dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. you remember the story of oedipus, don't you?
oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
i'm just saying you feel threatened by bart, but it's all in your head.
dad, i think you're overreacting.
this session's over.
goodbye.
are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?
and you're not doing it out of spite?
dad, i don't want to enter the tournament just to hurt mom.
lisa! did you make that awful effigy?
oh, you little-- come on, bart.
telegram for lisa simpson.
dear lisa. psych. psych, psych, psych. signed, super-psych.
huh? ehh, whaddaya want? i'm not gonna do "a" material for charity. and after all, that is why we're here.
no we're not. you're going down.
all we can do is play our very best.
now i'd like to introduce two of the tennis world's most unbeatable players, venus and serena williams.
that's our dad's seat.
you're dumping your own daughter?
yeah, that's pretty low.
our next match is marge and bart simpson...
...versus homer and lisa...
venus simpson? you're replacing me?
yes! i'm in.
yoink!
you're andre. i'm serena.
me neither. i'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
after the tournament, let's go out for a nice family dinner.
i can't believe krusty's retiring. this is tragic!
nutsy the clown.
i was at the flower shop.
thank you, folks. now, fasten your funny belts, as our own chimpendale's dancer gives you the full monkey!
time to blow up the clown...
and in 1984, portugal's carlos lopez becomes the oldest olympic marathon winner ever at age 38.
well, dad, i think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life.
you got all your equipment, dad?
attention, runners. on your mark, get set, now get outta here before i change my mind.
well, thank you for lettin' me chill in your crib.
please, mom. my dream is to be a rock star.
but...
don't be selfish, lisa.
what does it mean?
are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
cut it out! you're a grown man!
dad, l.t.'s gone crazy!
defuse it old school!
they called me "smelson"! haw haw.
are you sick of ordinary-shaped amusement parks?
it was all right, i guess.
meh.
squaresville sounds pretty cool.
come with me.
but you made it out of ham cubes.
hey, boat twenty-eight, stop splashing!
it's okay, but it's missing a piece.
what kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
i'm sure the gift shop will replace the missing piece.
yaaayy!
hey, tough luck, pal. you can't fight the souvenir industry. we're too powerful.
thank you, dad.
great!
you idiot. they were beating out my shirt fire!
thanks again, dad.
bart's got a problem!
he's a smelly ugly dork.
tommy.
they wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
yes, may i help you?
why are you doing zese things?
i cannot streak that much hair. think of the cost. i'd be ruined!
you see? zees is what i'm...
but we must have it. it is ze lifeblood of ze industry.
oh, homie, i love them. i can't thank you enough.
i tried to return my season ticket, but they wouldn't give me my money back. they said they wanted it.
nope. this is the equipment shed.
that's where we keep the water heater.
that's a tractor.
sir, we can't give your friend a refund just because the team is losing.
spin that back to where it was.
this meeting is over.
no. i don't. get out of here. no, no, not that door!
it's not anything. it has no purpose.
no, no. there's no 'ohhhh.'
no, no, we would never abandon our loyal springfield fans. by the way, all this barging into rooms marked "private" must have made you thirsty. would you like a beer?
now, homer, we've developed this additive that makes beer super, super malty. care to try it?
good grief.
all night. you were yelling at the swing.
dad, you were nuts.
he's right, folks. the only story here is the rich, smooth taste of duff.
well, homie, i believe you're telling the truth about the isotopes.
there's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. bob dylan wrote songs. cesar chavez staged hunger strikes.
oh, homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. you eat while you brush your teeth. you're eating a huge sausage right now.
you're really not gonna eat anything?
dad, i'm so proud of you. if you need some inspiration, here's a book of mike farrell's core beliefs.
goodbye, homie. here's dr. hibbert's number if you feel weak.
stop calling me that.
liars?
yeah!
oh, seymour!
yeah, but his weary shuffling makes my heart smile.
yeah, duck man! over here!
the spirit of cesar chavez.
because you don't know what cesar chavez looks like.
to tell you not to give up.
okay, skinny, on your feet.
well, homer. your hunger strike lasted twelve amazing days.
of course you are, hungry hungry homer. so why not break your fast with our brand new isotope dog supreme?
now, now, now, now see here, people... let's not be too hasty.
get him out of here.
eat! eat! eat! eat! eat! eat!
that ad campaign may have crossed a line.
homer, you're still here? you should've left for work an hour ago!
yep. it's great to have some time just to ourselves, huh?
yeah. the uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
i got it!
no, i got it!
springfield baby-proofing?
dead tired of baby-proofers who don't provide a free estimate. let's start in the kitchen. now, pretend i'm a baby. goo goo. me wike to expwore.
you see how quickly your baby could've been drinking this... similac baby formula.
okay, with the window bars, toilet latches, dingo alarm, and grapefruit-squirt shield, your total cost would be... wow, i'm rich!
that's the price of the clipboard. here's your estimate.
she's not afraid of bunnies.
no, no, no. oh, homie!
i'm the one who told you that.
how are you supposed to dial?
isn't that a little excessive? i mean, how are the buttons dangerous?
i'm a horrible mother.
oh, thank you. no more shiva-related pokings.
but we are hindu.
booo!
the safe-baby craze. it's sweeping springfield, thanks to one crusading parent.
the dream is over. shut her down, boys.
i have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. i call it "poindextrose".
oh, honey, we're so proud of you.
no, dad! didn't you listen to anything i said?
someone's gonna sleep well tonight.
i need this candy for school. candy class.
my teacher said i need cupcakes. cupcakes to learn.
i'm out of wine.
we need these because we have... to...
in the cart.
sir, please. i've already bagged it by color, and in order of each item's discovery by man.
hey, hey, watch what you're doin' there, sack monkey. you're bruisin' my duralog.
please. ow. stop. bag boys have feelings, too, you know.
excuse me? is there a problem here?
strike! strike! strike!
mr. simpson, please. will you go home?
hey, the dog smells something!
homer, no! those were made in the sixties.
"find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to africa."
we make household poisons and christmas lights.
sir, with all due respect... an old box of cookies is not a legal contract.
sharp corners... mr. simpson, we've decided to make good on your vacation.
uh, yes?
he is our leader. he seized power in a bloodless coup. all smotherings.
i will come down for your bags.
ooh, look, everybody!
wait, rhinos don't come from eggs.
i know, but...
that's terrible!
this is the earliest known fossil of a human being. it's over two million years old.
it's not the number of bones, sir, it's the...
oh, thank you. your ground is so comfortable.
this song has been going on for hours.
now, simpsons! run for it!
the left! go to the left!
wonder where this river goes.
oh, no! we're headed for victoria falls!
oh, no! it's eating us!
wow, dad. how did you do that?
are we insane yet? are we insane yet? are we insane yet?
mount kilimanjaro?
hey, maybe it'll lead us to bananas.
thank you. see, jojo, she likes it.
yes.
every day i get up at five-thirty, watch the chimps, eat a quick lunch of roots and water, then more chimp-watching. after dark i come home and think about chimps until it's time for bed.
possibly, but...
absolutely not! will you help me defend the refuge?
yes! 
she's one of the ten richest chimp researchers in the world.
buzz off.
hm, quite a promotion.
/ oh, he got overthrown!
breakfast!
i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?
meet linguo, the grammar robot. i built him all by myself. if you misuse language, he'll correct you.
i love beer.
this is why i can't have nice things.
they're for after dinner.
you can't have a brownie. period.
no!
stop it!
homer!
i'm sorry! i'm so sorry!
calm down! if we hurry, they can reattach your thumb.
123 fake street. got it.
...and harry potter and all his wizard friends went straight to hell for practicing witchcraft. what the diddly-yo?!
we've gotta get to the hospital, homer!
homer, help!
i'm sorry, homer. your h.m.o. doesn't cover this type of injury.
well, i could cut off the other thumb for a sense of symmetry.
no problem. just stick the ol' eye-gouger in the pickle brine. that'll keep your thumb fresh and delicious.
hey, ah, hey, ain't you gonna have a beer?
inflammable means flammable? what a country!
i reckon so. hey, somebody done stoleded my wheels.
i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?
dad, no!
hang on, linguo. you'll be up and conjugating in no time.
my bad. i can't work my answering machine either. now i need a new informant. say, lisa, people trust you. how'd you like to be a snitch? the pay stinks, but-- oh.
not right now. your father's in there and --
hey, somebody done stoleded my wheels.
bad grammar overload. error! error!
it's all right, boys.
exactly.
no, i'm not!
thank you, homer.
it says i have cooties.
that was great. i can't believe she found a rhyme for hezekiah.
eh, they'll all go to hell. say how's your life going?
that's great. maybe we could have coffee sometime.
i can hear her, homer.
okay, well maybe another time. you know, i better go check into my hotel.
oh, who am i kidding? i'm not over maude at all.
always do.
poor ned. he can't look anywhere without being reminded of maude.
homer, don't you have any respect?
wow, three pairs of shoes. someone had a fetish.
kinda.
you said we were doing this out of friendship.
maude's old sketch book. she was quite the little artist, you know.
you're right. maude designed a christian amusement park. oh, it must have been her final dream.
oh, bless you, sir. ah, gipetto's workshop will make a great stable for the nativity scene.
are you nuts?
darn teenagers with their beer bottles.
well, it's been a tad harder than i thought, but i'm not complaining 'cause i work for a sweet, sweet, boss. you're our foreman, maude.
ohhh, i'm not very good at begging people for stuff.
well thanks, homer.
you can have these, ah, fireworks i confiscated. some chinese people claimed they were celebrating new year's in february.
this sawdust will soak up the puke from the rooller-cooster. it's willie's special blend.
oh, maude, i turned your dream of a christian amusement park into a bemusement park.
homer, no! i can't exploit a divine manifestation.
oh, there's no explaining god's will, roddy. that's like explaining how an airplane flies.
you better stick your head in and see what's going on.
hello, gas company? how poisonous is your gas?... wow. but-- eh, but i'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... how could that be worse?... okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... i see. i've gotta close praiseland down. someone could get hurt.
may the lord have mercy on your gas sniffin', orphan beatin', soul.
hey, ned! i just read about your park in that horrible triple-a magazine.
i'm sure. so, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?
i know. we'll never see any of you again.
my turn, huh? let's see...
okay. homer.
mm-hm.
willie tickles the twine for two! oi! oi!
oh my goodness, an untied shoelace. i'll just get down on one knee and retie that.
homer, i'm afraid you've torn out your anterior cruciate ligament.
now, how did this happen?
it happened today.
you go, homer!
we've got to get you into surgery.
oh, he fell off the gurney. but it will take plenty of time and rehab before you can go back to work.
oh, you're also responsible for this hefty hospital bill. you shouldn't have ordered all those hospital haircuts and porno films.
now homer, i want you to stay off that leg for two weeks.
now, homer, there are people right through that door that have it much worse than you.
so, the tables have turned. now you're the shut-in and i'm the hip, young dude. there goes my wagging finger.
hey, homer!
hey, homer, i need to ask ya a favor. my baby sitter canceled and i got tickets to a christian rock concert. it's gonna be one wholesome evening. so, do you think marge could take care of rowdy roddy and typhoon todd?
would you mind watching the kids? i'm kinda in a pickle here.
mr. simpson, can we have another jelly and candy sandwich?
daddy said it's rude to call grownups by their first name.
pokémon? pokémon? with the pokey and the mon and the...
he told us how the world keeps screwing him over.
well, sir, i never heard a preacher use the "m-f" word so many times. anyway, thanks again.
oh, roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center.
so you are running a day care center?
well, i sure would. it would give the boys a place to go after school.
why did you put my name on the sign?
is your knee really gross under there?
can i touch it?
it's healing over my hand.
yes, whatever, just take them!
why, homer, your surgical incision is completely healed.
ah, yes. how is your day care center doing?
i've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
uncle homer, will you sing that crazy song we love?
yeah. hey, homer, i thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better.
what about us?
i contributed by not objecting too much.
anyway, this film crew... will shoot some behind-the-scenes footage of your amazing work.
it's already set up.
we're just restin' our eyes.
ow! you stepped on my arm!
tell me about the "homer cares" program.
awww. did you make 'em yourself?
this year's winner of the "saint who walks among us" award...
... homer simpson!
and he gambles like crazy.
three nines.
come to new papa.
we just spliced in some home movies. whaddaya think?
my polite indignation has no bounds.
where are we going?
where are we going, mr. simpson?
then you better turn.
yeah. / pretty much.
the teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
i can't believe it. we won another contest!
you're next, mr. simpson.
sir, it's a standard fee.
mornin', folks.
well, i s'pose i could spin ya a few more yarns... but first, who wants to give me a sponge bath? i'm filthy.
okay, ready for another impression? this is southside jake tearin' into tin can tillie.
dad, you just killed a poor, defenseless buffalo!
she even changed her last name to "appleseed." and her family changed theirs to "buffelkill."
the buffalo are gone. i think you shot them all.
yeah, i suppose you could grind some pills into it.
ooh, look out there, folks. that's the mighty mississip.
and that was tom and huck's last adventure.
i believe i told three stories.
you know, i do four hundred sit-ups a day.
oh, not at all. i like when people say nice things about my body.
babies, who wants-a babies...
okay. i sense you live with much misery.
i sense i should not take a check.
get out.
wait a minute. this isn't cedars sinai. you've ruined me! oh, why didn't i see this coming?
you stupid, stupid man! i curse you! you will bring bad luck to everyone you love!
gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens.
yeah, but a lot harder to catch. uh, go with the leprechaun.
well, okay, but hurry up.
...ya big fat ass!
maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
ah, the cursed one. how's that curse i cursed you with, cursed-y , hm?
hold me close... kiss me i'm irish...
the best thing about a gypsy wedding is i'm not the hairiest woman here.
what? bart is dead!
the gypsy said it would.
dinner is served.
bravo, pierce!
uh-huh. absolutely. / yep. /
oh, oh. oh dear me. oh yesss. yum, yum, yum. homer, my dear fellow. you're carrying quite a bit of tension in your back fat, homer.
can i top you off?
point one five.
you know, marge is quite a remarkable woman.
you're certainly a lucky man to have her.
machine, eh?
homer! homer, you're alive!
dad, that's the water softener!
homer, no!
oh, how magical!
she'll be killed!
shazbot.
oh-ho-ho. if our wampum wagon spots your kbbl party penguin, you'll win forty dollars!
hey, there's the wampum wagon!
yes they are, roy.
on the other hand, i was young once.
don't spit on my cupcake and tell me it's frosting.
according to this, your father was driving you to school? then where was he when you stole the police car?
you abandoned your son to win forty dollars?
and that was more important than keeping your son out of trouble?
i'm familiar with b.o.c. but you have got a boy here who is crying out for adult supervision.
sorry, bub. that crow won't caw.
i hereby order you to be tethered to your son.
tethered. report to room five.
there we go. how's that?
sir, you are not a size four.
well, maybe it'll be fun. you'll get to spend more time together. make sure your father takes his mood medication.
today we're going to talk about predicates and predicate nominatives.
mr. simpson, i'm trying to teach.
will you please just go back to sleep?
night terrors, ma'am.
hurry up, dad!
wow, my first home run.
can i ask you something, dad?
the town keeps getting bigger. will there always be enough electricity?
uh, i don't think lenny's house has a steeple.
yeah, this tether has some pluses. 
one beer, comin' up. hey, hey. no kids in the bar.
oh, the heat's been on since them bush girls were in here.
i'm cold and scared.
c'mon, dad. let's go.
really?
all right. hand 'em over.
there's a new judge in town with a hard-nosed approach to juvenile crime: punish the parents.
granted. but you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for bart. he might even make the honor roll, if dad can control his night terrors.
c'mon, dad. i gotta go to the bathroom.
come on, homer.
homer, just take him to the bathroom.
would you mind? i'm trying to do my homework.
oh, homie, no. we can't.
i don't want him to see us expressing our love.
no!
the lady said no.
you shut up.
what'd you do that for?
ah!
i'm sleeping in the bathtub.
that's right. it's me, judge harm, through the magic of fiber optics.
quiet, tubsy. you violated my order.
no!
quiet, little girl. you two need to wake up and smell the java. and the first step is to admit that you're bad parents.
you're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much i love my kids.
just, just let me get-- 
not yet. no. today the judge wants you to bend over so people can spank you from their cars.
i just can't do that, homer. it's a matter of principle. and i need you to support me in this.
i want goggles, too.
ahh!!
you're using my table saw to violate a court order?
gee, i always like to help you, homer, but i don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. and it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as...
if that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious.
concentrate, homer.
no. no, there it is!
we hate her, homer.
let's do this thing.
get away from that window! and help me with this banner.
let's get out of here. 
she's gonna find us!
homer, no!
my house!
that quilt was made by my grandmother.
we promise.
what's that noise?
what are you reading, homie?
that's odd. he's outside, digging.
there's no drugs out there.
yep.
nuh-uh.
go for it.
what's stopping you?
but morlocks are from the future.
yeah. how'd you know the chinese were spyin' on ya?
ah, quitcher bellyaching, coffee boy. you're lucky i let ya in here.
you take that back.
but, can you blame me? every day it's the same old routine. i serve you drinks, you yak on and on and on, and i never get one stinkin' tip.
ah, who am i kiddin'? i ain't smiled for real since i nailed that rat with the ice pick. ha, remember that?
ahh! how did i lose my passion for the job? when i was in bartending school, i thought i had the world by the jigger.
but who'll run the bar while you're gone?
... and if anybody wants potato chips or anything fancy, tell 'em to go to hell.
hey, what are you doin'? i gotta pay for that!
all right, look, i-i gotta go.
hey homer, do you mind if i bring in some outside food?
sorry. sorry.
hey, what happened to the music?
are you gonna be okay?
just ask if anyone knows ollie tabooger.
yell out "i'll eat a booger."
hey, homer.
hey, homer stop, stop! it's me! geez.
my professor said if i prettied up this dump, it would renew my zeal.
i am formico. the dean of design.
ah, ah, ah! my name must never be spoken.
just leave the bottle.
wow, check out the new moe's.
uh, looks like a long wait to get in.
hoy. hoy! is your name on the list?
it's okay, cecil. they're vips.
yeah, ya like it, homer?
ain't it trippy?
we don't serve duff no more. we got a malaysian beer that's better than duff... it's made outta soy sauce.
models?! ha. oh boy!
i'm trapped! this is creative design run amok!
and "penis" is russian for...
eh, you'd be having a great time if you'd stayed in your dark spot.
is it? oh, well that's it. that's-- dagmar, julian, throw this bum out.
whatcha doin', dad?
this is pretty far to go just to spite moe.
running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.
i won't drink at moe's / homer's old garage is all i ne-ed / i won't drink at moe's...
that calls for another beer.
i thought this was gonna be your bar.
can we go to bed now?
but you're not even using them.
how'd you get rem to play in your garage?
what the-- you can't open your own bar!
but it's illegal! you can't run a bar in a private residence.
ah, here we go. it also says, "a licensed hunting club must actively engage in the sport of hunting."
hunting? dad, no!
it's not fair, dad. why should an animal die just because you and moe are fighting?
do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
you do? then i like you, too. here, have a towelette.
you did it, moe!
my leg! aww, geez!
dad, you shot moe!
exactly.
aw, i'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have thanksgiving dinner together in this bar.
i did. you owe rem an apology for, eco-fraud.
oh, come on, bart. smell those curds! mmmmm, curds.
ah, here you go, pal.
fortune cookie.
oh... fortune means: geese cause problems.
every house has a bathroom.
is there a problem?
well, with all due respect, sir, i suppose you could come up with better fortunes?
well?
this gentleman here can write better fortunes than all of you put together. show them.
i'm sorry, monty...
look, there's one of my young chums now. you there!
tell my young sweetheart here of our youthful exploits.
play along, chubsy. there's a pie in it for you.
well...
well done, young man. your youthful trendiness will come in handy throughout the courting process. because these days... where did you get that pie?
new underpants? homer, what are you up to?
well, don't look too hip. you don't want that girl falling for you.
d-- oh, uh, constantly. when we're not being kicked out for our rowdy, youthful behavior! eh, pally?
put my hand on her knee.
i said her. and i said knee.
i'm going to make such love to you that, oh, you'll forget all about rudolph valentino. turn left here.
all right, you're dismissed. i'll take it from here.
did you hear that? that "excellent" was... excellent.
in time, in time. i need to speak with you in private. back in a moment, my dear. we have to, uh... uh... expel some urine.
isn't it wonderful? i'm head over heels in love.
monty! it's beautiful.
no! i'm engaged now! my ring!
uh-un.
don't say that, baby. i'm gonna win you back if i have to pistol whip this guy all night.
let me guess. now you're going to start working him over with the brass knuckles. you are so predictable.
wow, you don't get it.
i don't like bothering people at home.
i know you've been through a lot, ma'am, but we need you to stand in front of the burning house and say "channel 6 is hot, hot, hot."
never forget, homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart.
i don't get it, simpson. i'm a bad boy.
what do i have to do? grow a devil beard?
spill it... ooo, burly, you're insatiable. burly. you're so rugged and manly...
fantasize, marge. fantasize about burly.
"dear burly, comma, i've never written to a registered trademark before. are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? in either case, i would love a signed photo. sincerely, marge simpson."
person-to-person?!
how did you get my number?
oh, my goodness...
playing a prankeroo, eh?
you're not going to believe it. that paper towel lumberjack is coming here! for dinner! tonight!
i will! 
oh my god!
now you've done it. you really humiliated mom.
i suggest dinner and a show.
i guess it was a pretty funny prank. i like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
hey, smart move, four-eyes. sittin' next to skeletor here makes you look like hercules.
o-kay. is anyone here not a downer? anyone?
when i snap my fingers, you will transform into... a... famous historian.
thank you. now you are... emily dickinson.
now, you are a young boy... ah, yourself, at twelve years old...
ah, yes, yes. um...
well, is anything coming back to you?
no dad, everyone's sick of that memory! try to remember back when you were twelve. something frightening must have happened.
and there's your whatchamacall repressed trauma. i mean, who likes getting muddy? it's terrible. okay, let's go to moe's now.
fine. crap all over my theory.
you found a corpse when you were twelve? no wonder you've been so traumatized.
oh. okay. well, we'll just be going, then.
oh... oh, okay. well, uh, i'll see ya.
stop saying that, dad.
maybe we should come back in the daytime.
if there's a body in here, we'll drag it up. ah heck, it's just an old shopping cart.
it's the body!
but i did not murder him. and i can prove it... with this film.
ha, busted!
homer, shouldn't we give that skull to mr. smithers?
oh. well, you wanna take a look at it anyways, uh just for ha-has?
oh yeah, oh yeah, i sleuthed my ass off on this one. okay, this is a number six from somebody's address. or is it a nine? you don't know. uh, this is gravel. okay? gravel. this is uh, that's more gravel. okay, oh. this is a shell, that to me -- this is just me talkin', it looks like a helmet for a mouse... now, that sounds crazy, right. but if you ask a mice about it, they don't say nothin'. i mean they run the other way. at first i was just fishin' with the helmet thing. but then from the mouse's reaction i got, i got a little more concerned.
you know it is.
hey dad, will you help me build this model rocket?
i didn't know your dad was so interested in science.
uh, he didn't say science... he said "pie pants."
over here, guv'nor.
wow, did you see that yaw control?
well, then, could you stop calling us nerds?
oh, that's sensible.
dad, the rocket's off course!
now it's headed for the church.
this is the worst thing you've ever done.
why does jesus have a lasso?
that's it!
oh no...
you should be very upset.
mom, dad, my spiritual quest is over...
i'm a buddhist.
time to begin operation xmas-remind of-how good is. just do it. do it. do it now!
well, santa can take it back because i'm not ruled by material desi-- is that a pony?
more sugar, please.
yeah, i wanted to spend christmas with you guys.
uh huh.
oh. we'd better stay inside. at least until the squirrels stop melting.
he smelled like puke!
pennsylvania avenue. i wanna buy a house. hey, where'd they go?
that's it, baby. welcome to marvin gardens.
you're a little light here, dad.
well, i'd like to trust you, homer. but you've been in jail three times.
who else is gonna take care of her? dad?
and we carried it out as a family!
heh. too bad real women don't come with these, huh? 
take it back! take it back!
hello, i'm gabriel.
no, that's my pager. i'm a social worker. i'm here to help you stop fighting and become a family again.
sir, we know you're not an angel. my husband sees too many movies.
homer, i am not an angel!
homer, your problem is quite simple. you're a drunken, childish buffoon.
it's your fault, homer. but i've got an exercise that will help all of you break out of the roles you're stuck in. who feels like lunch?
you'll just have to cooperate.
...and plenty of beer.
we've got to do something, but what?
look, we can't fall into old patterns. we've gotta think of a plan.
fine, i'll talk like this.
give them the food!
give them the beer! it will impair their motor skills!
we are family!
well, i think you all did great. you broke out of your normal roles to accomplish something as a family. i've really earned my wings.
you know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger.
homer and ned, you may now kiss your brides.
homer!
you and ned married a couple floozies?
if i had known there were loose women in las vegas, i would never have let you go.
get out, homer.
now, now, momma's gonna make you a snack.
oh, no. she's making him a sandwich.
why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
bigamy.
you insensitive jerk! maybe this family would be better off without you!
why don't you just take britney beers and get outta here!
we had a good run.
gee, homer. your new wife is great. her lips look like night-crawlers.
wowww.
oh, sure. he paid for the hour.
why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
well, what about this? "the duff book of world records." it's got pictures of deformities.
it was originally published to settle arguments in taverns.
all right. outside.
wow, that's the best book i've ever seen!
francis of assisi .
why don't you try to set a record, dad?
only on mars.
three years.
uh, technically, the cobra would get the record. he's the one playing.
mr. simpson, there are thousands of people like you with no discernible talent.
shut up.
all the individual records were set by crackpots who half-killed themselves. the only way someone new can get in the book is with some kind of group stunt.
like that town that made the world's largest omelet.
/ what's he talking about?
i haven't seen this much flesh since elke sommers' hot-tub party. seriously, elke's great. always there for sick kids. doin' great things.
yeah, dad! you can be the world's laziest stunt organizer!
everyone, welcome to the duff book of world records: springfield is the world's fattest town!
haw haw.
you kids do eat a lot of sugar. but at least homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit.
if you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture.
oh, hello homer.
what are you talking about? is that dinner?
why didn't you just turn off the oven?
silence! i rule in favor of marge simpson.
and, thanks to marge's simpson's damning evidence... i hereby ban all sugar products from springfield -- forever!
i was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
mr. simpson, you are licking blood and vapo-rub.
there is a small group committed to bringing sugar back to this town. by any means necessary.
gentlemen, i have found the final member of our cabal.
homer, we need you to help us smuggle in sugar from south of the border.
i think he's grossed-out by some seaweed.
get a grip, simpson. you're doing fine. now, do you have your map?
okay man, there's the sugar. now you give us the money.
well, we're almost home.
hold it right there. surrender or prepare to be sunk.
no, i'm having one!
yeah.
good work, simpson.
oh, all right. but take maggie with you. mm. i guess you just can't use the law to nag. maybe i should just stop trying to change the world.
that's the best one!
ooh, a salute to brunch! wave to brunch, maggie!
uh-oh, the professor said not to let him get a boner.
homer, you're going to get in trouble.
litter is my most treacherous foe. i would like to eat its children.
homer, you've suffered a broken jaw.
you know, tomorrow is the annual springfield formal event. we weren't going to go, after last year's... unpleasantness. that donkey is such a bad influence on you. but breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. maybe we can go.
mm, thank you. this has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
homer, your breath smells terrible. i'll have to take off my shoes to cover the odor.
hello? yeah, i'd like to arrange for an escort please. to where? how 'bout "orgasmville"? hello? hello? uh, hey, how ya doin'?
i'm an alcoholic. homer, will you appear on my show?
well, he would eat all the time. we'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of hershey's miniatures.
he did such crazy things -- roll clip.
i'll take one.
do you promise not to wevive your weckless, weckless ways?
please, homie? no more craziness -- for me?
hm, all clean, just the way i left it.
we're rehearsing a play.
well, i'll be in the kitchen if you need me.
this place is so dull. the nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
it's seven-thirty!
the demolition derby? that'll scratch my itch.
dad, you've gotta do something.
she could get hurt!
so many dings. 
a man on a donkey! never in my six weeks on the job have i seen the likes of this.
this family needs a live wire, but it's just not me.
ooooh.
let's approach with caution!
pretty much. yeah.
oho! trouble in paradise.
homer, marge, i have a rather delicate proposition.
yes, i do have everything. but yet i often wonder what life with marge would have been like.
homer, i will give you one million dollars to let me spend a weekend alone with your wife.
what?
no way, no how! i'll get used to the snoring, just like i got used to saying "courtney cox-arquette". besides, i like some of the noises you make in bed.
wow! homer, that was amazing.
are you snoring while you're awake?
and you get more sprawl space on the bed.
yeah, i can't get artie out of my head. he's like a spy in the house of moe.
you're not on the guest list, simpson. orders of prom king ziff. and have you been drinking?
you're very sweet... but no fake prom could make me forget my husband. sorry. very well, marge. i see you'll never feel about moi the way i feel about toi. but, before the evening ends, may i request an innocent peck on the cheek? okay.
ah, well if it makes you feel any better, he's probably doin' her right now. oh yeah, make me the bad guy.
sounds like a plan.
marge, if you're watching this, then it means i've figured out how to work the camera. last night i crashed a certain fake prom. that's right, artie ziff's fake prom. homer was there?
but i can explain!
i know what you're going through. we're coming up on mount carlmore. i carved that one wonderful summer.
i'll put you on rig thirteen, as soon as they burn off the corpses.
looks like we're goners. oh well, circle of life.
ain't ya comin', homer?
but, homer...
listen to me, homer. you've won. you own marge's heart. and that's something i could never buy.
we can't take his money.
and our marriage, with his latest invention -- the snore converter. goodnight, homie.
for god's sake, homer. give them back their flame!
you can always find your favorite shows next month.
"springfield preparatory school?!" dad, you told me there were no private schools in springfield!
hello, and thank you for coming to our fund-raiser. i'm headmaster st. john van hookstratten.
monkeys point.
no, i belong here! pleeeaaase!
i will not be a gamecock!
no! 
it's so cute you're going to a little girl's house.
that car's as big as all outdoors.
homer, i see your daughter is one of those whale-kissing, dukakis-hugging moon maidens.
i just want my daughter to be happy. plus you eat the pretzels i drop on the floor.
yeah, i guess.
oh, that's just lara flynn boyle.
and where were you?
...so to win greta back, i have to go to toronto.
maggie, what do you think?
dad, no. it says "don't walk"!
oh, you'll win her back, eh. and b, we're closing in five minutes.
the geek shall inherit the earth.
i don't know, dad. what if she's still mad at me?
but she might say no.
dad, it's a documentary on the homeless.
a crazy dog's trying to kill me!
so bart, when does the killing start?
i guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
buck gave it to me. he's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. i wanna grow up to be just like him.
bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.
aw, homie, you'll always be my western hero.
i can't wait till i get good. buck's here! dad, why are you wearing that?
gee buck, your old films are as violent as today's!
sir you cannot pee / unless you are an employee...
boy, that's some fancy shootin'.
he's drunk!
did i forget to mention i'm an alcoholic?
that is just grotesque.
eh, we could try it.
you care about bart's feelings.
i'm sorry i let your son down, but i'm too old to change. seventy-six.
buck, if you walk out that door, you'll be branded a quitter forever.
ah, please, everyone, stay away. we don't want anyone to be a hero. a hero. a hero!
are you crazy? i'm a movie cowboy. and you're no howard hawks.
fine.
buck, you're my hero again.
well, there's krusty, itchy, scratchy, poochie, america's firefighters and then you, dad.
honey, i've got some bad news for you.
honey...
there is no xfl this year. the league folded.
homer, your father's dead!
it's grampa's smell. "old old spice."
but you were very open with your feelings.
me? i ain't dead. it was stimson down the hall. so much for mister "i can button my own shirt."
yeah, there's so many things we can...
b-6.
this game makes no sense.
i wanna drive again!
well, you're no angel behind the wheel. what about your d.u.i.?
please, son. driving is my last chance to feel alive.
fine, i'm dead.
woo hoo! and i want driving gloves!
what's the scoop, milkshakes? i got me a date with zelda, so i need the car.
why don't we double date? then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
cut it out. i can work the brakes myself.
dude sure got his comeuppance.
oh, zelda.
oh, everybody trusts lisa. precious little lisa, apple of her daddy's eye.
grampa, i gotta tell ya, she's a stone-cold hoochie.
shut up! you don't know her! zelda loves me! i hate this house!
he used to be such an angel. maybe you should give him another chance.
he is your dad.
death race?
first he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. your father's out of control.
so you've settled for branson.
yay!
now, i'd like my son to come up here. son, can you forgive an old fool?
bill... bill... bill. homer, you got a letter. hm. it's from the library.
here's the book... "classics for children?"
why don't you read to us now?
no dad. it's an epic tale from ancient greece.
dad, i loved it, too, but it was seven years ago.
hi-o-diddily-ysseus!
i'll say. i'd really like to go out and get the mail.
what are you laughing at, dad?
odysseus, do not forget to thank the gods for our victory with an appropriate animal sacrifice.
you gonna be askin' that the whole trip?
the feta is cheesy / the sirens are easy...
oh, where could your father be?
hey!
didn't you eat enough of your friends?
yes, i've been saying that for hours.
you're my la-dy / of the mor-ning... /
this is the face that launched a thousand ships. the other way!
well, look who the fates dragged in.
brave odysseus, it has been twenty long years. regale me with tales of your adventures.
it's never joan van ark.
victory.
don't burn her! she's just an innocent child!
of course they didn't, honey. "just then, sir lancelot rode up on a white horse and saved joan of arc. they got married and lived in a spaceship. the end." well, it's easier to chew than that bambi video.
cool. does he get to marry his mom?
could that fat ghost be telling the truth? first i've got to get uncle claudius to confess, then i've gotta kill him.
are you crazy? i can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
now that's what i call a "moon shot."
dad, that line was in the cartoon.
our phone bill is four hundred dollars! they charged us for a call to brazil.
no sir, i didn't.
homer! they must have made a mistake. we'll just go down to the phone company and straighten it out.
we've been charged for calls to brazil that we didn't make.
fine, i'll cut off your service.
homer!
why must you fight with every utility?
homer, we were cleaning out a cooling duct at the plant and found a box of old taco shells!
oh we tried. but a recording said you were a bunch of deadbeats.
crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme...
what call to brazil?
you made that call? but you're the good one.
oh, aren't you sweet? sharing your allowance with a poor brazilian boy.
he's so adorable. can we have another baby?
and with the money left over, the orphanage was able to buy a door. now the monkeys cannot bite me. uh-oh. i am like sugar to them.
not if we buy our tickets on the internet. it's really cheap if we change planes in phoenix, honolulu, sun city, and east st. louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now.
except antarctica.
okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer.
that's right.
mm-hmm.
no dad, it's just the weather.
yes.
ay caramba, que mujer tonta! veinte horas estudiar por nada!
look, it's the giant statue of christ on corcovado.
it says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.
boy, they sure love soccer here.
how to loot brazil?
look, the room came with a fruit hat.
i'm chiquita banana / and i'm here to say...
guys! while you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there ronaldo is waiting to be found.
yeah, check out the rats.
we're never gonna find him.
we nuns cannot fly.
you know i'm a vegetarian.
okay, on this map i marked all the places that ronaldo liked to go. if we split up, we should be able to search them all. 
ah, si?
excuse me, americans...
i feel so european.
here you go.
just one, and it's across town.
my american friend, i'm afraid that this is a kidnapping.
i suppose.
i'm afraid you don't appreciate the seriousness of the situation.
all right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?
oh, you two! we're eating genetically modified vegetables! look how big they are.
that's baby corn.
i gotta admit, i-i'm kinda nervous, here. we haven't seen barney since they enveloped him.
homer, i'm very uncomfortable having a gang of crows in our bedroom.
i'm sleeping on the couch.
caw! caw!
caw! caw! caw!
don't be mad at the crows, homer. they weren't trying to blind you. they were just trying to drink your sweet, sweet eye juices.
well, there is a medication, although it's a little... controversial.
i'm talkin' about medicinal marijuana. prescription pot. texas t-h-c.
homer, for your eyes, the best tonic is chronic. you're not afraid, are you?
smell any drugs, sgt. scraps?
but homer, you can't let a single bad experience scare you away from drugs.
it smells like the art teacher's office.
homer, you're doing drugs! and now i'm guilty of possession! i could go to prison! unless i testify against you...
hello?
honey, i like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. hang on, i've got call waiting. hello?
dad, i thought you didn't like her saxophone.
dad, it's one a.m. and i'm out of saliva.
hidilly-hey, homer!
homer, i-i-it's me, ned.
well, sir, of course he could... but then again... wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle.
well, luckily, i've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers.
i guess that could be arranged. ...the grace of the lord jesus be with god's people. the end.
well, i know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana.
well, okay... i, i guess it would go something like this: all right, simpson, you're under arrest, see?
i told you, i pissed it away. oh, don't make that face. yes, that's the one! smithers, i need someone who laughs at all my jokes. you know, honest feedback.
well, you're a happy homer. what's your name, young man?
oh smithers, i would have said anything to get your stem cells. now, welcome aboard.
where did you get that suit?
look, i'm really starting to worry. there's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!
you mutton heads, this is why we can never hold down a job!
whoa-ho-ho-ho. hey, "shemp" is "hemp" spelled backwards.
homie, i don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?
this just in: the marijuana re-criminalization initiative took another step forward today as supporters collected the final signatures required to place it on the ballot for next tuesday's election.
thank you. and now, a man who's a real poth-ead ... i'm sorry, pothead... homer simpson!
/ jobs? / what?
/ yes! yes!
what are we gonna do?
homie, you don't need drugs anymore. your eyes are all better.
homer, it's over. i want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again.
as long as you're doin' things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house.
yeah, i can still crash here, right?
remember when i dropped my keys and, and you thought the phone was ringin'?
what's the matter, homer? you're drunk but you're not like sloppy drunk.
dad, you just said that three minutes ago.
why are you keeping that thing?
ahoy-hoy, executive v.p. i'm putting the final touches on my speech to the investors and i need your generous guffaws.
oh, i'm drenched with sweat. i'm going to take a bathiola. when i come back, you'd better be laughing.
this suit used to belong to judy garland. ah, we could sing a song if you don't mind being mickey rooney.
oh, mr. burns! you were too beautiful for this world.
the investors' meeting is in twenty minutes.
mr. burns, a two-part question: one, when will you see a profit again? and two, what's that red stuff coming out of your ear?
yes, i regained consciousness during my big dance number. those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber.
what are you doing here anyway?
hey, hey, hey. i didn't ask for your life story.
wow, tell me some more.
now, where were we?
yeah. hop in, homer.
now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on.
hey homer, do you remember this voice?
no, it's me, krusty. and you're at the springfield friars club! where tonight we're roasting you, homer simpson!
hell no.
excellent.
now everyone knows homer loves his family...
we will not destroy the earth...one condition.
hm, all i need is one classic character...
hey...
don't you hate carpet stores that charge extra for the under-padding?
oh, what a day. maybe the headlines will cheer me up. that's opinion, not news!
which makes you ten trillionth over-all.
you heard the freak!
how'd you like to be played by john goodman?
dad, i'm no fan of bart's cartoon, but you have a real problem with anger.
no, you're angry. look, you're punching the cat right now.
congratulations, dad. the first step is admitting it.
if you ask me, you should give up fatty foods.
did it again! hm. where in the hell is that soothing music coming from? homer? what's going on?
come on, angry dad. get angry! don't make me do a clip show!
okay.
say it, don't spray it.
you're not welcome.
ha, ha, you love a boy.
clean up in all the aisles. welcome, steady customer. i see you are ready for the civil war reenactment.
here you go.
i don't know which part of that sentence to correct first. but i cannot come. i work 22 hours a day, and then i go home to a wife who will not touch me. the indian rope trick has become the indian "nope" trick.
the squishee lady!
go ahead.
take a penny, leave a penny. hey, she called me handsome!
come on, guys. we're gonna be late.
yeah, but i'm a recovering alcoholic, so...
hey, you're right. i was afraid it would start me drinking again, but it didn't.
the south will boogie again!
ah, well, then, you're definitely not going to like my steam-powered super spider! with the stepping and the squishing and the webs made of ny-lon! oh the ny-lon has been released.
are you sure you can get your deposit back? it's in pretty bad shape.
homie, what's wrong?
how did you find out?
no, no, no, let's just keep playing. what's the score?
we have to do something to save that marriage. maybe i should just tell manjula. or you could talk to apu...
what would that accomplish?
that's sad. all those kids.
i know, i know, there will be forty-seven bottles of beer on the wall. yes. homer, you did not bring me here for this. what is it that you want to tell me?
is there something you want to tell me?
it's true. it only happened once, but i am so ashamed. i am scum.
oh, i always thought karma was baloney, but not anymore.
kids, we want to talk to you about something.
i just wish there was something we could do... oh. oh, homer, are you thinking what i'm thinking?
you can run, but you can't glide!
tonight, we invite both manjula and apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming.
i keep telling you. off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. but if we remind apu and manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems.
even better.
hey pally, uh... where do you want the fudge mahal?
i know a great nametag place. they do fabulous work.
well, we had fun.
ooh, a challenge!
wait a minute. this isn't on the list!
not bad, eh?
eliza, where the devil are my slippers?
"my fair lady," performed with all-octuplet cast... done.
thank you very much, you big fat blabbermouth. i-- sorry, sorry, it's been a rough month.
who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?
my little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.
i'm more than okay!... ich bin ein... gymnast!
whoa! party house.
duh.
my bubble, my rules.
doogie howser went to college when he was my age.
i put those "cathys" on the fridge for you. i don't even like them. they've gotten so smutty.
homer, cathy is a woman.
what are you doing?
in the tree.
oh, i cannot listen to this again.
yeah, you must be some kind of marriage super-genius. how 'bout a few tips?
oh, i can't wait to see my surprise!
that caterpillar is screaming.
...which has chosen your yard as its home.
"screamapillar care tips." wow, look at all this stuff. "without constant reassurance, it will die. it's sexually attracted to fire..."
what does he want now?
put him down, boy! put him down!
why don't i hear any screaming?
then why don't i hear any sleep-screams?
didn't these meals used to have a cobbler?
you smell like cobbler.
oh, don't be such a nervous purvis. that's not a real skeleton, it's a halloween costume.
oh, don't be silly. i just use that to chop through those tough meals-on-wheels steaks. oh, i couldn't possibly eat all this. please join me.
oh homer, i feel like i'm talking to bennett cerf.
before you go, would you mind opening this jar of butter pickles?
oh my, you're as strong as you are handsome.
aren't you a wonder! can i call you the next time i need a muscular he-man?
freshen your drinks, ladies?
i am so sick of doing her dirty work. she's taking advantage of us, homer.
that man took my diamond necklace.
oh my gosh, she's dead.
so let me get this straight. this mysterious "man with braces" just stabbed the old lady and disappeared?
i found her will, chief. it was just changed to leave the simpsons fifty thousand dollars.
no!
no, nah, it never does.
yeah, if dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?
well, we've all got that voice in our heads telling us to kill. you just have to drown it out. i've been working on the railroad / all the live long day... yeah, that's better.
right away, sir. i-i-i don't want no trouble.
up-bup-bup. you didn't say you'd kill me.
go away! wait, wait! that's a suggestion, not a threat! homer!
i insist on searching every inch of this home personally.
oh homer, what are we going to do?
i can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
but we're innocent! it was the man with the braces.
i'm also your host. now let's meet a ghost!
it's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
homie, i'm sorry. i can't. i just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. the kids growing up, grandchildren...
my love. you saved my life.
chin up, homer... we've gotta put an electrode there to ground the brain stem. thank you.
you're on "frame-up"!
only me, carmen electra!
frame up is fox's latest hit! right after "no pants island" and "fart date."
we were in the green room. i had so much shrimp!
uh homer, my face is up here.
hey hey! hey hey! hey hey! hey hey! hey...
dad, no. we're trying to conserve energy.
jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell ro...
dad, it's a blackout.
look at those looters breaking windows, setting fires... they're living my dream, and you won't let me join them. please can i throw one little...
what if i just burn down a...
can't i at least incite further...
can i have a beer?
i don't care what they say. i won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.
dad...
homer, this is all your fault. if you hadn't plugged in your dancing santa, none of this would have happened.
mom, dad, someone stole my malibu stacy collection!
oh, forget it. they couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing.
dad, that's bart.
maybe we should look for clues.
yeah.
maybe.
dude... i need a new cap.
i think they demean women.
but i just got out of juvie.
well, you'll be happy to know malibu stacey's fine. i really appreciate what you did, dad.
you said you'd do something, and you followed through on it.
oh, that's it.
homer, you are so brave. if anyone deserves to take a penny, it is you.
if you like protecting people, you could make that your job. you know, start a security company.
well, who would my partner be?
him? no way!
well, nice work, inspector find-it. did you catch the thief?
well, i sure didn't.
nobody. okely-dokely.
a monster!
help me, springshield!
friend?
that commercial is very effective.
hey officer homer, how'd you get so big and strong?
homie, to honor springfield's newest hero, i made you your favorite dinner. all three courses are dessert.
you can let me go, but i'll just keep exposing myself at the mall.
dad, make him stop!
hurry up, boys. we gotta get these "toy poodles" to the pet shop.
radar love.
i'm with you, homer.
sorry homer. i'm a coward now, like all recovering alcoholics.
homie, please. why don't you just leave town?
we could come with you.
you are listing my broken dreams.
any last words, simpson?
oh homie, i'm so glad you're alive!
well then, who shot all the gangsters?
hm. time to check in on our little sweetie pie.
yeah, probably dreaming about the time she shot mr. burns.
i've got a whole list of things for you to do today. my favorite is number three!
those were for the church breakfast.
hammocks! get your hammocks!
the price is ten dollars, but i must warn you, this is no ordinary hammock. its webbing is a mesh of comfort... and evil.
beer... for me?
chores? me need clone.
nuh-uh.
why you little...
yay!
say homer, i was, uh, i was wondering if i could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me.
no problem! discover okay?
homie, i must say you have the energy of twenty men lately.
i do!
dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?
they look like you, they were rude to patty and selma, and the horde has been described as "very gassy."
good god, we're doomed!
thank you, general. that's a big relief. the horde is almost dead! there's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning.
...twenty eight, twenty nine... there's one missing.
break into the bank and snatch that dough... please don't hurt our family.
i very much doubt that, homer. these are horrible ghouls from the past.
pardon the grabbing, but i've perfected a device that could save us all... a time machine. we can go back to the past and save our guns.
...poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator...
hey everyone, that's us!
dad, what are you doing?
tell me again why we're spending our vacation on "the island of lost souls"?
now he may try to slobber on your crotch.
homer, someone's in trouble!
homie, something very creepy is going on here.
i think i'm going to do a little sleuthing.
hey, homer!
hate to be a needy neddy, but, uh, could you do me a favor...?
oh, c'mon homer. all i'm asking is for you to yank my teats and harvest my milk.
oooh, that's nice. you're actually quite gentle when you want to be.
shhh. hey.
okay, but i'm keeping the tattered vest. i still have my dignity-- hey, slops! oooh, a toenail!
hey dad, check it out!
we were just playing.
let's eat maggie.
sure, check in the fridge. wait a minute. i'm at work. ya gotta pay for it.
sorry, homer.
i'm afraid so.
yuh-huh.
are you gonna buy those toads or just lick 'em?
thanks for the donation, mr. simpson. do you feel okay?
yeah, i guess i got caught up in all the glitz and glamour.
homer, i'm so sorry. have a free beer.
homer, can you say the alphabet backwards?
hey, i'm worried.
ah, rats.
hey, we can't let our friend drive like this. i'm liable, here. get his keys!
where to, pal?
homie, it's five p.m. we're having dinner.
no, it was the night you got loaded at moe's and the car had to be towed home.
it's true. i couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. i had to tell mr. burns you had violent diarrhea.
do you remember how you got home last night, dad?
there's no light rail in springfield.
i will, dad.
another proud moment for the simpsons.
oh, you big fooler. pretending not to remember so you could surprise us.
i had no idea, dad. i just assumed with all the stranglings, you know...
then there's those other days. where you just wish you never got married or had kids. one minute, you're a carefree teenager with dreams of being a rock star, or a photographer for playboy... then bam, some babe gets her claws in ya...and boom, you got a buncha kids that always need love. so whammo, you get stuck in some boring job where they don't let you play guitar or take pictures of naked women, and all you can do is watch yourself get bald and fat, and kiss your dreams good-bye...
so i'm just some babe who sank her claws into you?!
have you always resented us, dad?
sorry we ruined your life, homer.
get in.
a place where you'll never be bothered by your family again. get out of the car, homer.
rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!
we had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point.
and even though you knew i ratted you out to the irs, you never busted me on it.
so to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. do you like it?
i don't know, but it's starting to get dark.
how ya doin'?
welcome to rock 'n' roll fantasy camp, where you'll experience the complete rock 'n' roll lifestyle, without the lawsuits and std's.
now you're all here for one reason...
have you been awake all night?
you took pills you found on the floor?
but there's lots of other fun instruments, like bass. come on, who'd like to be a bass player?
my image!
i'm telling mr. jagger.
the clothes you wear on stage should be a defiant statement of individuality.
fire! / yes! / all right! fire! / hey!
setzer.
what is it, homer?
we've gotta start using a cheaper oatmeal.
okay, strut, strut, strut, strut, strut, spin and... rooster! look everyone, homer's got it.
lyrics are the hardest part of songwriting. but when you come up with something meaningful and heartfelt...
will you stop saying that?
you just want mindless generic rock?
gettin' away from the gig can be a matter of life and death, so you gotta be in great physical shape. okay, follow me! paparazzi to the left!
they're bloody cardboard!
uh, you rock, homer.
that was great, homie.
camp is over, homer.
i'll take that.
come... on... dad...
dad, you knew this day was coming.
stop kicking me, dad!
no, i'm fine.
cheer up, homer. it's only rock 'n' roll camp.
tell you what. we're doing a benefit gig before we leave town. how would you like to join us on stage?
for serious, homer.
sir, you can't...
wow homer, i ain't had front row seats since my moonie wedding.
i'm so proud of you, homie. it's like you're kid rock and i'm pamela anderson lee rock.
lenny, don't you have a crotch to stuff?
there you are. we thought we were going to have to go on without you.
uh, homer, you didn't think you were gonna be playing with--
look, sorry if there's been a misunderstanding, homer. we really just need you to tap the mics and say "test, test."
i'm his groupie! am i saying that right, "groupie?"
why is he performing the duties of a roadie? am i saying that right, "roadie?"
hey, he's not rocking out at all.
not on my shift.
did you know it was going to turn into a riot, dad?
did they ever find tom petty's toe?
no, sorry.
we're doing a gig tomorrow to benefit the victims of tonight's gig, and we'd consider it an honor if you'd join us.
are you sure you don't miss hanging out with your rock star friends, dad?
mr. simpson, this zone is for school buses only.
a year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.
networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.
get back, honky cat! those systems are too expensive.
and the winner by a nose is "no risk"!
okay, now all we have to do is install your satellite dish. can you be home from eight am monday morning, through june?
boy, that's jim dandy roof candy! i'd love to come over some time and watch that church channel.
oh, you'd win that bet. seems like i'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. or as i like to call it, "pray-per-view."
cool! it's the nbc news feed!
it's wednesday night!
why don't you turn off the tv and join us for dessert? i made a pie.
would you like some ice cream with that?
sucker.
got it.
i'm so sorry. lisa's a very special little girl, and we'll spare no expense in finding her.
the plastic casing from the tip of bart's shoelace! a mother knows!
oh my special little guys. you're okay, you're okay!
the headlines proclaim "dewey defeats truman."
harry truman triumphs by two million votes.
i win, dad. that means i get to choose today's father-daughter activity!
we're building homes for the homeless.
dad, what is that?
oh. if only i had your courage, señor.
dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring.
this is a band-aid wrapped in tin foil.
well, he's not much to look at...but he is a good father...hel-lo, ring tan line! he's new on the market!
well, i've read enough articles about flirting to know it when i see it.
ah, homie, are you as attracted to me as you were when we met?
sometimes i worry you might think about other women.
that doesn't sound very convincing.
not feeling well. going to bed. dinner and breakfast are on the table.
homer, let me explain something--
homie! oooo, homie... hey, what happened?
now, don't get too used to these. that awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days.
whatever bart is saying is a lie. mom! what happened? your endowment's bigger than harvard's.
mom, doesn't it bother you that they're giving you all this attention just because of those?
hooray!
homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?
kiki highsmith, highsmith modeling. honey, i like your look.
that's not why i'm here. i can offer your wife a lot of modeling work. trade shows to start, then who knows?
that's great, mom. but don't forget... i got krusty in hot water / now i've got to help him out / da da da...
oh, i don't get a song? mom got a song.
dad, look!
lisa learned a lesson! lisa learned a lesson!
i finally feel like me again. you're not disappointed, are you?
anyway, you're the only man i want ogling me.
oh, homie.
who let her jugs out...?
marge let her jugs out...
who let her jugs out...?
yes, if he's smart, he'll hold out for millions.
i don't know. work the stomach. mm... that takes me back.
heads up, dad. here comes the scum!
this is a joke. you'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood.
it's a hockey game!
this sucks. how come lisa gets something and i don't?
your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.
bart! watch your potty mouth!
why do you always hire the cheapest guy?
but where will we live?
sorry, folks. every hotel room in town is booked.
i do not want another lecture from a german backpacker about how we don't appreciate the national park system.
hey, simpsons.
wow, lenny. your apartment is stunning.
come on, guys, you gotta stay. tonight's the big cock fight. ah-- we can eat the loser...
oh yeah, the gimmick is, it's a house from 1895. and you gotta do everything like they did back then.
you could save mckinley.
i like what i'm seeing in there.
they go to pieces over nothing. they're perfect for reality tv.
oh man, i can't wear this. i look like buster brown, whoever that is.
hey, you should see how much trouble dad's having shaving with a straight razor.
well, okay. blow out that lamp and i'll take off my victorian undergarments.
if you just...
no!
this has been the worst week of my life. i miss my toys, my video games... "mutt 'n' jeff" comics are not funny. they're gay, i get it.
yeah, i can't wait to see which one of 'em dies first.
with all this hard work, i'm too tired to worry about the world. and soon i will marry one of father's wealthy business associates!
i guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
mr. simpson, your contract allows us to do anything we want to you.
uh-huh, that's what we used.
oh no, everything's ruined. our good bellows... our stereopticon... squiggy! homer, your strop! your strop!
we're not allowed to interfere with the reality of the show, which reminds me... burn the leftovers! leave nothing!
when you put your t-shirt on backwards?
psst! psst!
but now we're going to escape. we're going to overpower your crew and return to civilization.
and yet i've learned nothing.
no, homer, no! that's our only way home!
oh, it sure is good to be home.
i think i'm gonna be sick.
yeah. if we read books we could form a club.
hey dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?
three minutes forty seconds -- a new personal best! maggie? no one will ever know.
anything good?
help, please! someone throw me a stick!
ha, ha, ha. go ahead, look. the whole world already saw it in "nudist camp commandant." i wore nothing!
who ordered the steamed gentile?
don't worry, us pigs will catch this killer. now mr. simpson, is it possible you're living a double or triple life that your wife doesn't know about?
fair enough. now i will need round-the-clock access to all the simpsons, especially bart.
dad, i can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own.
fair enough. but now that we know what it can do, there's no need to... mother f...!
homer, think carefully. of all the people you have known, who might have reason to do you ill?
the late frank grimes...
how can one ordinary man have so many enemies?
ah. homer, in order to identify your assailant, i must follow you through the course of a normal day. just do what you usually do and the killer will reveal himself.
this is a normal day?
welcome to your springfield mardi gras headquarters. cast your vote now for this year's king!
our time is passing, old friend.
well, we've settled that argument. you can't read a magazine and drive.
but your car was built in croatia. it's made from old soviet tanks.
homer please, the last thing you need is more enemies.
the trap is set. the killer will think this dummy is you, out for an evening stroll. now we lie in wait, like hungry cassius for noble caesar.
odds bodkins! 
now who's the sociopath? huh?
thank you, lord.
i'd just come up behind him with a knife and slit his throat real quick-like.
listen homer, i don't know who your killer is, but i do know he'll strike again. your only hope is to stay completely out of sight.
homer simpson?
you've been elected king of mardi gras!
honey, the king of mardi gras has to ride around on a float all day. you'll be a sitting duck.
homer, it's a trap. you only won because somebody stuffed the ballot box with these.
but i'm afraid you'll get hurt.
today's tuesday and you've had six beers.
the killer is out there. i would stake my entire fortune of cigarettes on it.
a mechanic...? my god, that's it! homer, you must get off that float! the brake line has been cut!
hey, how 'bout some beads?
i've saved a life... and it feels wonderful. and yet, i could just as easily drop you to your death.
everything going dark... like duff stout, the beer that made ireland famous. i love you, doris! i...
there's your killer!
jesus is our only king.
frank grimes, junior.
don't you remember? your ape-like incompetence drove my father insane.
what's this? "extremely high voltage". well, i don't need safety gloves, because i'm homer simp--
he's dead, like you should be!
dad! i figured it out! the murderer is...
dad, i'm really glad you're still alive.
well... i guess i've... dear god... grown accustomed to your face. i've grown accustomed to his face / and dreams of gouging out his eyes / i've grown accustomed to my hate / my plans to lacerate... to dis-embowel / to hear him howl. the very reason that i live / is plotting how to watch him die...
but i'm not tired!
hey, i only hung out with krabappel because skinner blew her off. i've never seen her so sad.
and you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
nope.
sorry, grampa.
grampa, you're not even going.
ewww.
i get to tamp the powder!
this woman carried me for nine and a half months. i was out for two weeks, then went back in.
i believe the only venue for me is the ride of broken dreams.
so many categories... gym teacher of the year, substitute teacher of the year, most wheelchair-accessible school award?
i love teachers. in fact, i'm a teacher. i taught paul mccartney to go "whoo!"
shut up!
julio estudiante...an inner-city math teacher who taught teenage gang members that differential equations are more powerful than bullets.
i love happy endings.
step away from the wall. step away from the wall.
that'll be fourteen dollars.
mom, dad, my birthday's coming up, and girltech turbo diaries are in stores now.
just buy me the friggin' toy.
dad, you can't eat all those free samples. we've got to get lisa's present.
dad, you ate all the free samples. now you're eating men's slacks.
unauthorized user! access denied!
i'm anatomically correct! go ahead, take a peek. i wonder what mommy's medicine tastes like!
shop o' the mornin', homer! just call me "mall" flanders.
sounds like fun! let's party!
i wonder what this could be?
could it be some kind of book?
you were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
i don't like mcnuggets, i'm a vegetarian!
dad! that information is all wrong! maggie's a baby, not my best friend! you don't know anything about me!
i don't think so.
i'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.
dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. it's too late.
yeah, at least you ain't aging six years for every one 'cause of your cow heart.
he found out who was cobbling shoes for me at night. turns out i have severe schizophrenia.
no, look lower.
what can i do for you?
let me guess. it's about a girl.
it's always a dame. usually with gams that don't quit. till they get to the shoes. and then they're only napping.
okay, i'll get a line on your kid. i charge fifty bucks a day. plus expenses.
chunky... lover... 53?
one word.
at aol.
is that miles davis' "birth of the cool?"
so you know one thing about me. big deal.
well, maybe.
because this lab is cruelly testing consumer products on animals. take a look for yourself. they're making monkeys smoke cigarettes... and look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!
dad, today was so great. the animal rights protest, a visit to the museum of sadness and oppression...
how'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? did mom help you?
what report?
you read the "loves his daughter" by yourself?
i believe there's still the matter of my expenses.
it's itemized.
yeah, but if i'd eaten the whole thing, it would've been free.
early on i was working under the theory that your daughter was a werewolf. it didn't pan out.
you'll regret the day you crossed dexter colt.
i was framed! you believe me, don't you dad?
blackening our hair was a great idea, dad. i look just like a powerpuff girl.
lady penelope ariel-ponyweather.
your real name?
thank you. sign here, mr. uppercut.
hello?
uh, "a." and i'd like to add that proposition "hug lisa for me" has my full support.
aw... life on the lam is really hard, but at least it's with you, dad. i feel terrible for putting you through this, after what a wonderful father you've been.
what? why?
why did you do that?
how could you?
all right simpsons, the jig is up! we know you're in there!
i don't wanna eat from the trash.
they must have come from over there. those are the test animals! the detective must have sold them to the circus.
how ya doin'.
you should have paid the expenses.
how did she find us?
i can't see!
hey dad, will you read me a bedtime story?
yeah! everything must go. even the painting of my nana. this was done on her wedding day. or should i say "deading day."
everything here is sword. sword baseball bat, sword rifle, sword pineapple, sword sword sharpener, sword pie-- hey what happened to the sword pie?
do you need some assistance picking over the tattered remains of my life?
what's there is there.
right this way. my first weight set.
they know you are talking about them.
there is no way all this junk is gonna fit in that car.
sure, i'll carry you in this giant snuggli. i used it to carry rob schneider in the movie "my baby is an ugly man."
why is it ned flanders?
all right, just to the mailbox and back.
two, three, two...
two...
ten, ten, ten, ten...
twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
oh my goodness, it looks just like the kwik-e-mart!
i'm a magazine rack.
all this does is shoot bubbles. aggh! silly string!
what if she doesn't?
the air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.
no way.
stop it, please! i'm trying to eat. and all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
mom!
dad, do you plan to get in shape?
i got all the way out to the tree before i realized i'd left the house. i'm stronger than i've ever been! i don't have to go back inside. i'm not afraid!
not any more! you've just been marge-inalized!
hey, hot stuff. i've got a competition tomorrow. i could use a good-luck snuggle.
let's do it!
huh? why didn't mom make our lunch?
i'm tired of her criticizing my saggy glutes.
so then i pop my delts, clench and bam! not a dry eye in the house.
and that's why i didn't win!
starting tomorrow, i'm gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel...
you know, i really do miss being a lady.
mm-hmm.
dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a wnba game.
fine, i'll go back to being bored.
and now, its time for our fifty thousand dollar half-court shot. the winning fan is in section a,
row 12...
... seat 16!
i'm sorry sir, your car is still blocked in...
that cuts the mustard with me.
the steering wheel is a giant onion ring!
what are you doing?
that's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
well, whatever i've got i owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. plus a little prayer now and then.
and now "ken burns," a documentary by ken burns about the life of ken burns.
they so consumed my life, i never had time for a proper haircut.
i've never actually been to a baseball game. the fresh air gives me hives.
you're watching monkey olympics on fox!
she's throwing her diaper at the judges!
setting up a prayer station, eh, homer?
fudge!
homer, god isn't some kind of holy concierge. you can't keep bugging him for every little thing.
i'll just call a plumber.
you know, most people pray silently.
your pipes have more roots than the list of all-time top-rated tv shows.
slip and fall? can't go back to work? i'm larry h. lawyer, junior. and i will fight for you! i also habla español.
homer, we can't sue the church. they'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin.
homer, please don't sue the church. i'm asking you as your friend and neighbor.
we're very sorry for the victim's injury. but as this tape demonstrates, mr. simpson is accident prone.
okey-doke. we find for mr. simpson in the sum of one million dollars.
dad, i think this might be the work of satan.
homer, for the last time... please give the church back. that is gonna drive me nuts.
and there are so many places to cloister myself!
well, the court has spoken, so... here you go. the baptismal font tends to run, you have to jiggle the handle. oh, and wednesday is garbage day.
dad, there's a bunch of people in the community outreach center.
homer, that was not very christian of you.
so where's marge?
homer aren't you afraid you might be, i don't know, incurring god's wrath?
see, i don't know that he is. in the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt.
let us pray. dear lord, please spare this sinful town. they were misled by a demon in blue pants.
i can't believe you talked me into this.
how could you make me baby stink breath and not even tell me?
your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a...
of course, the stock market's been down lately. but there must be some sort...
you spent all the money i earned?!
bart, stop that!
mom, i am sick of the way he treats me. he disrespects me and i'm just supposed to accept it?
i heard a wonderful saying today: "forgive and forget."
good point, dad. what would jesus do?
i'm here to serve you with a subpoena.
it comes with a side of bacon.
yes.
yes, i want to be emancipated.
mom, you've always been cool to me. but homer is a lousy dad and i'm not gonna take it anymore.
mr. simpson. your son alleges that you have an anger management problem...
why you little...!
all rise for the verdict.
no judge would send a pre-teen out on his own...
that boy's about as safe living with you as a crawdad in a gumbo shack. bart simpson, i declare you emancipated! further, i hereby garnish homer's wages until bart is fully repaid.
that means half your paycheck goes to bart!
homer, don't make things worse.
sorry mom. i gotta go.
darn it! i keep pouring juice for five.
i think he might come home if we can show him we can treat him better.
hi guys... dad.
well, you need an expensive couch to watch an expensive tv.
thanks dad, that means a lot to me.
just a reminder: if you're getting bogus returns on your investments...contact goldman sachs, the skewwwed financial planners. up next on the half-pipe, boarding legend tony hawk.
an extreme word?
i didn't say extreme to the max.
i can relate. i'm a father myself. one day they're little shredders. and the next day they're grinding and gnashing their way to college.
i'll lose millions in endorsements, but, okay. this board represents the ultimate in poser technology. it gives people the illusion they have talent.
just lock your feet in and the board does all the work.
now the portion of our event where champion tony hawk may be challenged by any unknown member of the audience.
dad, how drunk are you?
shhh.
dad, you don't understand. this was never about being cool. it was about you not caring how i felt.
homer, you're heading for a parental face plant. do a 180 emotional ollie. 
mr. simpson, i like the way you handled yourself on that board. would you like to do a commercial for us?
excellent. i represent viagrogaine, the topical rub for bald, impotent men.
oh, steve. you're everything a girl could want. what's your secret?
ooh, a new hamburger sandwich.
dude, take it easy on the fatty foods. you're running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart.
it was so exciting -- i actually got applause for being smart!
hey, hey the ribwich is back!
try the new ribwich. it's so good you'll croak!
try the sauce -- i'm soaked in it!
and yet my children think i'm a failure.
sir, are you all right?
oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!
well, why don't we celebrate by going to a movie?
really? it won't be the same without you, dad.
dude. if you still want the ribwich, they're testing it in other markets. check out the tour schedule.
that's what we do. we're ribheads.
welcome to the games of the 34th spellympiad. i'm george plimpton, founder of the paris review. i also played the evil dean in "boner academy."
he replaced my tennis racket with a rubber phallus.
well, i'm just happy you guys all came up here to calgary with me.
dad, this is my moment in the sun. how can you miss it to be with a sandwich?
lisa, may i see you privately for a moment?
hey man, can you turn me on?
will you get out of my... look, about the ribwich. there aren't gonna be anymore -- the animal we made 'em from is now extinct.
people, we went through something magical together -- and it's not important who got rich off of whom, or who was exposed to tainted what. and because you believed in my dream, i want you to fight over the last ribwich ever made. here.
i give-a you the lease-a to my car.
intransigence. "i..."
dad, you do care!
lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing.
hold your horses. i was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.
oh, what a magical evening. the moonlight, the music, the water...
poor ned. this is his first jellyfish festival alone.
psst! homer!
i need your advice. it's about a lady.
no, it's sara sloane. i have a date with her tonight.
yep. why would that twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
well sir, that's very encouraging but i can't date a movie star. i'm no arthur miller or lyle lovett.
now she's dating mr. flanders. that's so romantic!
mm-hmm. i haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
why, those guys are such leeches.
this is quite a dil-diddly-lemma. i better talk this over with the big man. homer, sara wants us to have s-e-x.
well, i'm not sure i want to do it. i mean "who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?" you know, the cow being me.
i bet we woulda lasted twice that long.
i'm very happy for you, ned.
i need a quarter for the bus.
i got lisa's plankton kebabs!
how much longer is this going to go on?
dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?
we've already been to room 915. we've already filled out form 1790.
i never thought i would say this, but i think we have to move.
occasionally, you might hear a faint roar...
it's a good offer. i advise you to take it.
why don't we go to our congressman?
i've been saying it for three weeks! but every time i open my mouth...
quick! someone perform cpr.
that's ccr!
congressman wilcox was laid to rest today. a special election will be held next month to fill his vacant seat.
how can you say that?
why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?
because i was thinking about the american family! one family in particular, who was stepped on by the government and had nowhere else to turn.
i'm talking about the simpsons.
you said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. and now they're worse than ever.
dad, this is a kid's menu where you help yogi bear get to the washington monument.
that's jelly.
we've gotta do something to help him.
excuse me, i think i can help. i've been working in this town for a long time, and well, i know how to get things done.
now homer, that southern congressman is your biggest obstacle. your job is to drink him under the table so he misses the vote. you think you can do it?
how 'bout a drinkin' contest, boy? right after i vote on the latest bill.
okay, paperclip, do your stuff. now we just need a distraction.
at last those planes are flying where they belong.
what about you and mom?
oh, okay.
who's naïve?
this is so romantic.
homie, i'm sorry... you know i usually bring my a-game to the bedroom... but tonight i just can't throw the heat.
you're so cute when you're begging for sex, but i'm just too tired.
game over.
welcome to "how to strip for your wife".
oh yes. i put myself through medical school dancing under the name "malcolm sex." i pleased the ladies by any means necessary. now, let's start with a full review of the theory of stripping. paleosexologists tell us that-- what the hell are you doing? homer, are you already oiled?
that oil was for the entire class! homer, take this quarter, call your mother and tell her you're never going to be a stripper.
you there, the greasy, naked bald man!
what would you say if i offered you the secret of true success?
the trick is to blot the oil. wiping just pushes it around.
you see this watch? it's jammed with so many jewels, the hands can't move. what kind of watch do you have?
friends, there's a force that runs through the universe. we used to call that force "god." we now call it "megatronics: the forty-eight tips to corporate success."
do you want to be the ultimate you?
do you want to yodel at the top of the corporate mountain?
will you write me a check made out to "cash?"
sounds good to me.
what's that ruckus?
uh-oh, that's toxic waste!
oh, have you now? well huzzah, huzzah. i'll just throw back my legs and pollute my britches with delight.
and what book is that? the ape who wanted a big bonus? stop wasting my time, you corn-fed man-cow. would you mind?
i didn't know mr. burns had an electric eel pond.
oh, homie. don't let it get you down. so mr. burns doesn't take you seriously? big whoop! who gives a doodle? whoopie ding dong doo!
who's this burns guy? somebody you work with?
well, if this guy's ridin' your rump, why don't you slap him some payback?
or give him some face time with sweet lady brick.
don't you get it? if you get rid of that bird, burns is at your mercy.
the owner of the plant is gone. all that's left is this little mirror he used to amuse himself. hello, pretty boy. that's quite a beak on you. who wants a kiss? who wants a kiss?
good lord! that canary was supposed to be my pigeon. i need to find a patsy quick!
yes, yes, hello. now, i need to find a patsy.
you're quite the friendly fellow, but right now i'm looking for a patsy.
you bumbling fool, i keep telling you i'm looking for a patsy.
finally, i would like to add to any nuclear inspectors in the crowd, that the titular head of the power plant is now mr. homer j. simpson.
that man's mad. smithers, get this bedlamite an alienist!
so, the caterpillar has emerged from its cocoon as a shark with a gun for a mouth. i only have one thing to say to that... bravo.
we clashed lances on the champs de mars, and i have been bested. the plant is yours. treat her well.
yes?
hey-ey-ey, goodbye!
oh, i don't think he was going that way.
dad, please. you're the head of a major corporation.
dad, have you looked at this earnings report?
if you don't patch the leak in cooling tower two, you will go to jail.
this is your vacation.
homer i'll go over the year-end profit forecast if you'll stop looking at my boobs.
i got a gold star at school today, for my exposé on toxins in gold-star adhesive.
homie, i know you've got a lot of work to do. but this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family.
dad, this just isn't working.
hey dad, you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight.
i don't wanna do that.
homie?
knock, knock.
he's doing eighty years on an opium bust. i never saw a man take to a turkish prison so quickly.
scream all you like, no one will hear you!
keep begging. you're just wasting precious oxygen! brick by brick, i seal his doom.
hey dad, pitch to me!
hey! you nearly hit me on the head!
y'see? this is the stuff mom won't do with me.
nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. all that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.
dad, my life lacks direction!
oh dad, look at this one!
we certainly do.
why did you say that? is your check gonna bounce?
why did you say that? are you implying that i'm dumb?
dad, that's a moth.
dad, that's a kaleidoscope.
uh-oh -- sounds like some bad eggs are cooking up trouble.
pro or con?
boy, this light has really screwed up the animals.
live from new york it's saturday night!
palm recognized. access granted!
it worked -- i got my sky back! dad, look!
thanks, mom.
i wonder what mom came up with for this week's 'family wednesday.'
dad, we weren't playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking.
i'm in.
does anyone have any swan heads? i've got nothing but necks.
turn it over, homer.
ooh, look how late it is. let's get you kids some coffee. homer, no scissors!
oh, i guess he's done with all the fun stuff.
i can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.
ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. but it looks like you're missin' a piece.
this awful. it's like listening to schubert's unfinished symphony!
welcome to moe's. home of the finest bar crystal in springfield. i shouldn't have cheaped out on the shelf.
young man, you've ingested a dangerous amount of alcohol.
i found the missing puzzle piece. it was under maggie's eyelid!
it's james taylor!
you leave me sitting here all alone... ...while you play video games with your neanderthal friends. why don't you just stop playing? homer, i really don't want to feed you. video games and too much beer. you sure know how to show a girl a good time. tonight i learned the two of us can't work. james taylor. homie, remember that song we used to sing? mock...
ing...
bird...
homie, what's wrong?
oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?
huh? oh my god, i forgot all about this. where did you find it?
homer, i'm sorry you saw that, but i was very upset that night.
well, i love you, of course. but a lot of things you do still drive me crazy.
a little bit, yeah.
you made your own breakfast? looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
i'll fix you something.
well, there are a lot of beer cans around here.
homer, let it go. it's not always going to be perfect. we've been married for ten years.
well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
dad, where are you going?
but you're not gonna get divorced like milhouse's parents, are you?
welcome to my place. i just have a few rules. if you see a necktie on the doorknob, i'm with a lady.
uh, homer, i think you want your house, next door.
hello, simpson.
no. he's nobody! shut up, stuart!
homer, before you move in, you should know that julio and i have an active social life.
homer, what grady is saying is that, how can i put this? we might have a cocktails, say, where all the guests are male.
that's right, homer. we're gay.
i despise the springfield shopper. what is that? all the headlines are jokes. uch, where'd you buy this? from the guy on the exit ramp? this is disgusting.
thank you, homer. it's a pleasure cooking for you.
it's either him or that girl who put "mother earth" as a reference. and with a male roommate, we can walk around naked.
that will be one hundred dollars.
your father sure can be thoughtful when he wants to be.
hey, i love watching you guys fight. it's my earliest memory.
dad, your hands feel so soft.
oh, it shows! i haven't had a strangle that smooth since i was four.
yes, homie?
so, how was your visit home?
so, it's over between you two.
he's gay. he's gay. gay. gay. bi. gay. gay for pay. gay.
homie, i tried to tell you how i feel, but i can't find the right words. maybe he can.
homer, marge wrote me about what happened. and as soon as her check cleared, i was on the first reasonably-priced flight here.
yes.
they were pretty much the same, homer.
now here's a song i wrote for you. a little ditty 'bout homer and marge / her heart was as big as his stomach was large / oh yeah, they say love goes on / long after the grilled cheese sandwich is gone.
homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?
dad!
well, we've got the cure for that. margaritas!
homer, weren't you supposed to meet your wife half an hour ago?
hey, julio: ouch.
now, for ye knights' and wenches' delectation, i have some royal proclamations. we welcome cub scout troop number 102, we wish a happy birthday to karen, and congratulations to marge and homer simpson on their reconciliation dinner.
oh homer, a guy as cool and special as you will have no trouble. believe me.
that was a close call. we took this much out of you. but it's still not as bad as the first time i treated you for alcohol poisoning.
destroyed your marriage? why, i've never seen a woman look so devoted. let's look at the tape.
he's stable now. i'll leave you two alone.
and i still do.
well, you'll never have to.
homie, what are you thinking?
not true! but you are welcome to sing the many beloved public domain carols such as o tannenbaum, good king wenceslas, jesu joy of man's desiring--
hey homer, writing a new christmas carol?
well, the bible says it's fun to do stuff together. there's a stranger in the manger and his name is love take it, homer! oh, i got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus.
f-l-a-n-r-d-s!
yeah, he wishes.
no thanks. but i would like to sing it with you and produce it.
f-l-a!
e-r-s!
f-l-a!
d-e-r!
you don't have to move your feet / just hate flanders to the disco beat...
mass dismissed!
i am so sick of that song!
why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?
i still think you should have left that at the motel.
balloon ride, wax museum, the denzel washington monument, colonial phoenix, hey, dude ranch! and there's no radio or tv, so we won't have to hear your song!
or we could go to walter gropius's bauhaus village?
"on this battleground in 1881, fifty-six indians lost their lives and four brave americans lost their hats."
i'll show you how they get on a horse where i come from. daddy, i need upsies!
would you like to be photographed in my great-grandfather's headdress? he unified the nations of the western plains. five dollars, or three for twelve.
unfortunately, the beaver is also our god. in retrospect it was a poor choice.
sure. and when we do, your breakfast will be comped.
eight.
four.
i'll save you!
oh no! they're making beautiful music together!
homie, i'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up.
they took the bait. let's go.
drink deep from these cups. the bear urine will make you strong. actually, it's fresca.
homer, those are elk.
lisa, welcome to love. it's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. but then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts.
you, homie.
can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?
hey, you passed the lumberyard.
isn't this dangerous?
i'm impressed that you drew up blueprints, but these are for a go-kart track.
actually, frank lloyd wright endured a lot of harsh criticism.
you said his name two seconds ago.
gotcha.
oh, that's it. you are going down.
the amish are so industrious. not like those shiftless mennonites.
very nice. did you do the wiring yourself?
/ help!
homie, get out of that treehouse!
our little hero sure likes kahlua and cream.
mr. simpson, how long have you been a cat person?
terrific stuff. you must really love the broadway musical "cats."
seems like you're quite the animal lover. do you have any other pets? a dog perhaps?
stop it, homer, that's inhumane! use the choke chain!
according to this contract, we have to change his name to "suds mcduff."
it also says we will receive royalties in perpetuity, a bottomless keg of beer and unlimited use of the duff corporate jet.
oh pilot, let's swing by... oh, heidelberg and drop in on oktoberfest.
dad, five minutes ago you hated him.
...eight, nine, ten wads of cash. your dog has sent duff beer sales through the roof.
oh really? well this tape says different.
dad, you can't let him take our dog!
but i miss him. he was my best friend.
look, to get our dog back, we need a plan.
this stunt cost fifty million dollars!
and you've been bitching about it for thirty years.
don't send a duff dog to do a duffman's job. hold on, sir. soon you'll be filling your lungs with duff, duff lite, or new duff blue -- tap into the peppermint glacier. are you there, god? it's me, duffman.
it's good to have you back with the simpsons.
all we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
uh-oh, dad. i think he peed on the rug.
i think he left a "big hug" in your lunch box.
that cat saved your life.
he woke you up when you stopped breathing last night.
dad, you ate the last can of tuna.
okay, five more minutes and i'm chewing my hand off.
homie, where have you been? i've been calling all over for you!
he's editor-in-chimp!
well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so i can reach you.
lindsay naegle -- veriqual cellular. and i can offer you a whole range of cellular solutions.
i insist on it.
why don't you get one of those hands-free phones? it's the next best thing to paying attention to the road.
of course we have headsets. but you would be mad to stop there. tell me -- what is currently plugged into your car's cigarette lighter?
i weep for you. these days, everything from fax machines to coffee makers can be plugged into your "dash hole."
i guess i'll have to do all your driving chores. that's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.
why can't you use the local dry cleaner?
dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. why don't you take public transportation?
way to go, dad!
get in here, boozy. you're late for your drunkening.
good for you, dad. could you get me some syrup?
we don't have time for choking!
i'm stressed because now that you've lost your license, i'm a full-time family chauffeur!
to hell with the livery commission!
indeed. you take this teacher evaluation test. i'll proctor. read the directions silently as i read them aloud to you.
we're playing dominoes.
why, you're the first one here! please accept this free ticket to the 1939 world's fair.
stop saying things!
hey, i'd like that. i can't. i have to go pick up grampa... he proposed to another hooker at the bus station.
yeah, walking's made a new man out of you.
you shake me from my booty to my 'fro...
bite us.
hi homer. i'm actor steve buscemi.
you can't walk to turkmenistan!
would we!
i am so sorry, homie. how is your crushed pelvis?
i don't know what happened. i saw you and i went for the brake but i hit the accelerator!
that's okay. i can handle it. homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?
i'm sorry! i'm sorry!
oh, you're really coming along, homie.
gee, everything always works out for you. oh my god! let me help you up!
what? that's crazy.
that's ridiculous. i don't like you. i mean hate you, hate you, hate you! i hate you!
maybe we should see a counselor.
perhaps you feel that your husband sees you as less of a partner and more of a doormat.
that's okay, take your time. all right, before you came in, i asked you each to make a list of the people that are most important to you. homer, you first.
that's us in a nutshell. i care so much about you, homer, but i'm not even on your list. excuse me.
all right. i have an answer. you must perform for her one completely unselfish gesture.
yeah, full custody, that's exactly what i... you're an idiot. you gotta knock her off her feet with something utterly romantic... something that says i care about you.
i do, but the hour is over.
romantic dinner.
you wanna know how to make a peach crumble? kick it in the groin. ha, anyway, what's goin' on?
hey, me too. i could whip up my famous poulet au vin avec champignons à la carl.
oh homie, you got everyone in springfield here for me!
just kidding. here's one of my many classics.
you hooked up in high school / now you've come so far / then you started to hate him / and hit him with your car.
i love you, too.
except a place to live and free food.
i want to thank you all so much.
what?!
vite! vite!
ned, i am so sorry.
i am so tired of that tautology.
you are so right, ned. there won't be a single minute where bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... homer, get over here!
here are some supervised activities we can all do together. future veterans of foreign wars, the 5-h club...
you won't be seeing milhouse for a while. something about that boy just shakes up your soda. ooh, this looks interesting: the pre-teen braves.
dad, maybe you could lead bart's tribe.
ideally no, but...
i am "burger with fries." man, is that uninspired.
hey, lazy horse! find us something cool to do.
i smell smoke.
well, thank you. i'm gonna make sure you boys have the best possible pre-teen brave experience.
the great spirit blessed us with beauty and abundance. the land gave birth to the trees, the animals frolicked in the waters, and the wind was so gentle it would tie your shoes for you. but that harmony has been shattered. and now the land weeps.
"we will crush you and smother your dreams. yours in christ, the cavalry kids."
candy for sale! get your un-poisoned candy!
oh, the indignity!
at least we made a lot of people sick.
it's on the back of our vests.
vip? that's us!
pound him, milhouse!
c'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the sumatran century flower.
because i know every time you say "pick a number from one to ten," it's always seven.
no, there were twelve.
the venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...
dad, the traffic's moving.
my baby!
well, this is it. the last call for moe. god. god, god... whaaa--?
ain't she adorable.
well, i have so much free time now that moe's our babysitter.
you could be my father figure.
i can help you.
yeah, sure he was, nahasapasa-imraisin'apervert.
i peed my pants.
i had to. it's so weird watching the video and not getting any sound.
well, can i at least give her this moe-bile? eh? eh?
hey, you never cared about maggie 'til i started paying attention to her. last night at the bar you called her "raquel."
is that uh, "get out" like leave, or "get out" as in: "get out. you banged bridget fonda?"
now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender.
maggie's gone!
well, it looks like maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall.
listen, i think we might have to make a trip to little italy.
maggie's right in the middle of that italian-american-mexican standoff!
no. you've got a family. i'm the guy with nothin' and no one. no, no, don't try to stop me.
thanks, moe. i'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper.
i don't think maggie wants you out of her life, moe.
you thieving hussy! 
will everyone please stop fighting and burning!
i am death!
your time is up, bart simpson.
dad, do you realize what you've done? you've created a world without death.
i guess so.
homer, it's trash day. will you just take him out to the curb?
dad, you've become the new grim reaper!
where's the regular guy? where's doug?
oh man, these seats suck.
dad, were all those people on the list?
no!
all right.
thanks for not killing me, homie. here's an extra pork chop.
sir, i'm honored to inform you that you've won the nobel prize.
this is professor john frink, isn't it?
and i thought halle berry went nuts during her acceptance speech.
i thought our mysterious pranksters might be here tonight, so i covered the meeting hall with ultraviolet powder. behold the perpetrators!
why is bart so tall? and shaggy?
why can't i tinker with the fabric of existence?
what happens if i press this button?
sorry, sorry, sorry!
don't go inside -- it's a trap!
the irrepressible hundred-year-old sky diver will be buried as soon as his body is found. now, it's time for the channel six "oops patrol!" this week one eagle-eyed viewer spotted this hilarious headline. mayor unveils erection to cheering crowd. this week's "oops patrol" t-shirt goes to...
mom made the oops patrol! hot damn!
it could always be a little better.
homer! win your own t-shirt! 
dad, the word's "desert." and those farmers are suffering!
don't drag me down with you, old man.
oh, relax. i'm sure it's just your brain going crazy.
you always go with your gut. this time, why don't you listen to your brain?
no.
this is boring. can't we go home? this overpass smells like urine.
fresh urine.
yes'm.
homer, you're hugging a bum.
sorry about all the cloak and dagger homer, but the government is still after me for what i did in the sixties. they're probably tapping your phones and reading your mail.
to reach you, i called up my friends in the liberal media and planted that story about the giant pizza.
i saw this macaroni pencil-holder homer made me, and i realized how much i missed him.
oh.
not for someone who tips nine per cent.
i'm sorry, my wife left me this morning.
you gotta say somethin', she's lookin' at twenty years. and my legal license expires in fifteen minutes.
and peggy in the coffee shop, what a pistol. a mere nod in her direction and the refill was in the mug. the jets in the whirlpool anticipated my every move. when it was working. and three dollars for a local call? they should be the ones on trial!
well, now that i'm free, i intend to be a better mother to my son.
oh, baby! now you're free to come back to me!
i read a book that said women like jerks.
homer, this really isn't necessary.
oh well, you snooze you lose. but uh, can i have my photo albums back?
supplying false information on a national park register is a federal offense... which you've committed at every national park, from acadia to zion. you're going away for a long time, mrs. simpson. or should i call you... anita bong-hitt?
dad, i'm just as sad as you are. what happened to grandma is an outrage.
she was acquitted. then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
well, they're transferring grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. i say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!
homer! what on earth are you doing?
he's a big one!
homer, get out now and no one will ever know you were involved.
if you stay here, you'll be abandoning your family the way i abandoned you.
pipe down, jules verne.
homer, it's two in the morning.
then what was in the coffin?
i really shouldn't be here -- i have a problem with games of chance. i played candyland with maggie and ended up throwing vodka in her face.
that was always on too late for me.
and the winner is, seventeen!
i'll be bringin' sparkplugs to chuck at people i don't like. like you!
i can't beat nelson.
i can't believe nelson is more popular than me.
no, i'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options...
where did you get that tutu?
lisa, you look so successful. like you're the wife of a businessman.
no. i was being sincere.
lis, skinner is using you. like a pawn on his unholy chess set.
they made me pretty and popular just so they could exploit me and ruin my good name.
would you be willing to pay an extra dollar twenty-three in taxes to fund them?
well, i guess this story has a happy ending after all. just like my last massage.
but this is my dream.
okay, let me take figure skating.
well, what can i be?
okay.
the best you'll ever have.
uh-oh.
no one's touching the hors d'oeuvres.
well... someday i'd like to go on a nice vacation.
yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and i don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon.
well... okay. for mom, i'll do it. where should we go?
that sounds great -- but only if your father promises to behave.
because i want to encourage all the world to come see the beauty of twenty-first century britain.
there's so much to see here: parliament, stratford-on-avon, the white cliffs of dover... oh, and you americans love castles -- there's a huge one in edinburgh, the city where i was born.
i'd love to, but i'm late for an appointment. i'm greeting a lovely dutch couple at gate 23. cheerio.
actually, i'm not a butler. i had already hired this cab when you got in, but the more the merrier and all that.
i wouldn't dream of it, sir.
did you spend an unforgettable night with a soldier from the u.s. army in 1944? you did? was he from the first infantry division? he was? and was he a gentle caring lover? he was? sorry i bothered you. i don't know if i'm ever gonna find her.
now completely free of "mad fish disease."
you punched out three people on the street.
do you understand any part of what you just said?
homie, i don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here.
it's a bet, lord daftwager.
thank you, my dear. please take these free tickets to my play.
we thespians believe it's bad luck to mention the name of this particular play out loud.
quiet, you blundering fool. you'll curse us all!
stop saying it!
mom, you said macbeth!
homie, you're doing a great job driving on the left. this is turning out to be our most enjoyable trip ever.
turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning...
we'll deal with him, your majesty.
dad, you rear-ended the queen of england!
changing of the guard!
what difference could it make? he hit the friggin' queen! i guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.
i'm a man!
i haven't had an easy life. i've seen my country ravaged by war, my family torn by tragedy and then, as i was innocently making my way to the shops to buy light bulbs, i was blindsided by this great lumbering brute.
if there's any love left in you for me, destroy him.
poke the monster with a stick! tuppence a jab! c'mon, queue up, lads.
we found a secret tunnel out of the tower. it was used by sir walter raleigh!
smash it on, don't worry it. let the pike do the work.
push the gray brick in the back of the fireplace.
put out the fire first.
englishwomen don't pump gas naked!
mummy, he's everything you said he was.
i picked mom a bouquet of erigeron elatiors. daisies. flowers.
lis, your stupid present will only last a week. mine will sit in a closet for years.
this is even worse than you think -- look!
mighty yamses, we are weary of building your food pyramid. let my pickles go!
grampa! you have a job?
oh look, jaclyn smith has her own line of axe heads!
endorsed by the american carny association.
all this attention! i feel like a secretary on administrative professionals day!
"kitchen carnival?" i love it! thank you, homie.
what is that?!
homer, are you spooning that snack?
i think you should get rid of her. then we can be together... forever!
homie! what happened to you?
dad, you got attacked by a bear?!
yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day.
you can strangle bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation.
i'm an intensive care bear.
crying in the corner huh? mind if i join you?
all right. that's enough, fraidy sue. here's what you gotta do: find that bear what whupped you, and whup him back.
mr. simpson, if you want to find that bear that attacked you, use this. it tracks an electronic tag i stuck in the bear's ear. it's the same technology they use to keep tabs on gary busey.
oh, dear lord.
homer, there's no rear on that thing.
now look here, mister. i forbid you to fight a bear.
dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. that's the whole point of moby dick.
you're not going, and that's final.
or dead.
you're sneakin' out to fight that bear. i wanna go too.
screw that. when i grow up, i'm legally changing my name to joe kickass.
why don't you take a bath in the river? this bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.
a killer bear is on the loose in springfield forest, and local laughingstock homer simpson is missing and presumed mauled.
a bounty has been placed on the rogue bear in the amount of ten thousand dollars.
well, i'm proud of you, homie. you set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.
i don't know, but whoever's in there is taking their sweet old time.
no. okay.
maggie's locked inside!
i tried the coat hanger again. i don't understand why we only try ideas once.
oh well, i'm glad you think they're cute, 'cause they're your problem now.
we did -- homer took him. didn't you?
three hundred and fifty dollars an hour.
...and so utterly repellant he...
now tonight's guest host... the ultimate place-holder... homer simpson!
dad, you have to say something. something meaningful!
yeah, yeah, twins, i get it. now let's watch something i'm really interested in.
uh, listen homer. i'd like to raise an issue.
about that, you know i've been with the show from the beginning and i was uh... i was wondering if i could get a small cost-of-living raise?
that light's a little bright. do you think they could move it?
ah, simpson, i hate to bother you when you're eating, but you're always eating. will you sign an autograph for my boy?
i eat legos.
it's great, dad. you have tremendous power. and now it's time to put it to use.
i say live fast, die young, and leave a big fat corpse.
now, wait a minute. dirty words you can spell on your calculator is a very important subject. boobs. just like what girls got.
dad, you blew it. you listened to lisa. and then you lost your stranglehold on the audience.
oh, homie, you may have lost your show, but you went out in the classiest way possible. i'm proud of you.
come on, homie. we'll go to the "make your own sundae" place.
... ha.mo.shel be.khol-a.sher-lo sim-na yad.kha ta.khat ...
they're not getting married!
happy thanksgiving from the entire channel six family, including kent brockman, who's contractually permitted to replace himself with a cardboard cutout. the real kent is in a rehab clinic. we all wish him the best -- again.
hey, homer -- i'm your secret santa. merry christmas, big guy.
and the first season of magnum p.i. with commentary by john hillerman. apparently, working in hawaii was a pleasure.
i think it's homer.
homer, you're the most selfish man i know.
all right, everyone. it's time for your christmas "boni." everyone gets a five dollar cafeteria voucher...and for your boy, a confectioner's card featuring a current baseballer. it's that rookie from the new york nine.
i'm sorry, but i'm afraid your card is only worth... everything i've got! everything! take it! oh no! i've smudged it with nacho fingers! i must deftly lick it off. deftly.
this is offensive to christians and prunes.
you have excellent taste. this is our finest talking astrolabe. it also comes with a notepad and a pen that works upside down.
today is the birthday of comedienne margaret cho.
can we get our big christmas tree now?
dad, i don't like the looks of this neighborhood.
colombia's main export is coffee.
isn't it kind of dry?
what's that?
you wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!
i am not returnable. i will be testing my smoke alarm for the next three hours.
you just don't get it, do you? christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself.
you can sleep on the couch tonight.
and now back to "mr. mcgrew's christmas carol."
i can't find my way back to the home.
i'm sorry. pardon me, ma'am. i see you're expecting. may i listen to the baby's heartbeat? 
i don't need love, i have money. sweet, sweet money!
spirit, surely there is some time to reform my selfish ways.
nooooooo!
dad? are you okay?
it's saturday, december sixth.
that last one looked kinda good.
you've made that promise before.
well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans.
these pants smell worse than my old pants.
wow, a photo cube with pictures of us!
oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. and tears are the sweetest sauce.
oh, very nice, ned. but i'm afraid you're a distant second this week.
that was led zeppelin.
homie, i'm so proud -- you changed more than i could imagined! you're even covering your mouth when you burp.
wha?
those are my feet.
you just tweezered my wang.
dad, you don't have to out-do mr. flanders. just remember the spirit of the season.
actually, most people now feel christmas has gotten too materialistic. in fact, as a buddhist, i believe people would be a lot happier without presents.
presents are material goods, and attachment to material goods kills the soul. i'm not going to jail again!
your behavior, it's like, it's like, not sanctioned by any governing body. you're like, wild.
stop! friends, what homer did was wrong. but i've been thinking -- maybe i was just as wrong to give you those gifts.
stop that! you can't pray on city property.
amen.
nine, ten, start over again. one, two, tie your shoe....
i got the roofi tickets! i got them fair and square and i kept my dignity. not like janey's mom.
that ad makes me look like a criminal.
that wasn't me!
three!
i try my best. they ridicule me. they mock everything i cherish.
you're my rock, homie.
awww...
what are you going to do?
i always keep one near the bed for you.
i probably should have watched it first.
it says "yes on two thirty-two". we want no on two thirty-two, yes on two forty-two.
they say "yes no two forty-two". and it's the night before the election and you haven't handed them out! i need to be alone right now.
can i bring my laser pointer?
i got it! bart, i got it! i ran here as fast as i...
i said no!
it's no! his old bike is fine!
i see. so if my old bike didn't work, i would automatically get a new one?
i know how you feel, lis. no kid wants to outlive their pet.
can i, for true?
hey, pally. i don't want to down-shift your enthusiasm, but that's a floor model. your bike is in here. i could put it together right now -- for a small assembly fee.
dad, no! think of the bike.
yeah, great workmanship.
haw haw! your dad's not handy!
face it, you're not the most mechanical guy in the world. but you're good at other things: like... eating while driving. that's somethin'... and nobody gets madder at the news.
if you can't build a robot... be a robot!
hey, it didn't fall apart. smash this six pack! awesome! i gotta tell milhouse.
oh, lisa. honey, it's okay. you're a buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life.
c'mon, homer. how long does it take to go to the bathroom? huh? dear bart...
what's this? knockahomer has dropped his hammer.
...then knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer!
dad, what are all those cuts?
dad, it was so great -- knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!
this robot's the greatest thing you've ever done for me. i can't believe you've never seen him fight.
well, the next match is saturday. can you come then?
our robot can kick that robot's ass! right dad? dad?
you guys are just in time. my dad's about to tell me something important about our robot.
don't worry, i'll raise him like the mean streets raised me.
my job was to keep lisa's hope alive. but instead, she's really depressed.
business, what business?
you look a little sluggish out there, boy. i'd better open you up. dad?!
so, you fought all those robots?
that is so cool!
yeah! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! i am the luckiest kid in the world.
that robot has given birth to a man!
i'll tell you what gives, i'm afraid he is subject to isaac asimov's laws of robotics. with the sci-fi and the so many books, not too many good. my robot is programmed never to harm humans, you see, only to serve them.
go! go! go! now's your chance!
why did you make it do that?
well, you did disappear a lot, but i have gone whole summers without seeing you.
i could also deep-fry the bag.
yes, we're well-protected against every threat, from bomb-toting bolsheviks, to golden-armed jazzbos.
consider yourself fired!
okay, here's how it goes: buyers never tell you what they're willing to spend. and when they talk privately, we spy on them through this one-way mirror.
let's get outta here. i'm not shaking that guy's hand.
buy me! buy me! buy me! buy me!
you work at the nuclear plant.
don't you need training for that?
not if i pump your heart full of morphine first!
tonight? but i was hoping you could watch the kids while i work on my novel.
homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call.
i know -- i got your message.
i'm writing a novel!
for the third time, the hospital. you're an ambulance, not a taxi!
why don't you just admit you don't know where the hospital is?
oh homie, i've had the most exciting day...
we're not paramedics!
i suppose i better. your father's a very private person.
homie, i finished my novel.
it's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
it's double-spaced.
well?
did you read the book?
did you like it?
oh that's wonderful. and the characters didn't bother you at all?
and you're fine with me trying to get it published?
we're doomed.
oh mr. homer, anything for a cuckolded boob, i mean, loyal customer.
nothing, nothing. it just seems your wife has an "active imagination."
you'll see when you read your wife's book.
if you do you'll see she lusts for flanders.
the harpooned heart ii: thunder down under. chapter one. temperance barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie...
you told me you liked it! you didn't read it at all! you lied to me!
well... there is a place called nantucket.
it was only my imagination.
dear lord, please make homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts i had about the girl on the raisin box.
huh?
advice? just call me ann flanders!
...and a backrub can just be a backrub. it doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
oh, homie! you're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book.
that's the best review i've gotten. seriously. these reviews are terrible.
jack ruby was a man, not a jewel.
mom, that sounds a lot like the movie "amadeus," which was historically inaccurate. mozart worked hard on his music... salieri was a respected composer...
we suck!
attention american bar devils: it's our anniversary! free drinks for everyone!
what did you plan to get your wife, homer?
just get out this door, rummy, and you're the city's problem. if you make it through the night, you're welcome back.
oh, you poor soul. you think that rat is a remote.
why are your clothes so dirty? and why do you smell like liquor? have you been clubbing? homie, they're beautiful. that chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! i feel a swoon coming on... here it is!
oh, you poor man. you smell worse than you did last time.
hey buddy, that's nice sign work. your penmanship is clear yet sad.
oh yeah, yeah. you know, number two and number four are an item now.
well, there are six schools of begging -- bad musician, messed-up vet, cripple, fake cripple, religious zealot, and crazy guy. i think you would do well with "crazy guy."
homie, i'd like to know what you've been doing after work.
i also found this in your drawer.
are these diamondique?
diamondelle?
cubic diamondium?
dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
we finally have something to put in the wall safe. hostess twinkies?
kids? go ride bikes for a while, huh.
you got your wife the earrings, man. why are you still doin' this?
you're panhandling! i should have known from that panhandling sign! plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
homer, i don't need fancy things. and even if i did, this is the wrong way to get them. and to remind you of what you've done, i'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions.
nothing.
what're you talkin' about?
all yours, homer.
didn't have to, i'm a dude.
hey, my-my pants aren't down!
what's all that racket?!
what's going on?
yay!
it used to be the "leaning tower of pizza." they just painted the tower brown.
it's application day at miss wickerbottom's pre-nursery school.
you know, marge makes a good point -- competitive schools aren't for every baby.
i will hire a collection agency.
maggie, we're not a mime school, so we can't take a non-talker, but here's some good news: the gap will always need sweater-folders.
my baby has no future!
grocers don't make that much.
maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. c'mon.
well, congratulations. you're now as intelligent as a pig. let's see if you can move up to dolphin -- how many people in your family?
go, maggie!
yes, thank you.
maggie, i can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over! look at these courses you'll be taking. "advanced peek-a-boo". 'got your nose' and other lies...
well, then... find a new identity.
all right, if i'm second rate as the smart kid, i'll find a new raison d'être.
aw. buh. kkk. huh. oh. muh. eh. er.
this-is-huh-oh-muh-eh-er's-doc-tor. he's-too-sick-to-work-today.
i hope this typeface catches people's eye. it sure didn't move our old fondue set!
giant tongue.
maggie! the red button... hit the red button!
maggie! press the red button!
lisa! you're all right!
maggie, push the red button! you can do it. red!
uh-hmm.
i believe i can answer that.
i'm afraid your daughter is no longer welcome at our school. she's as common as an angry woman in an ibsen play.
she could be... at sweeping up hair.
but they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
sorry, pally, the dingleberries are sold out. but looking at you, i'm sure your kids are used to disappointment.
sold out... sorry... not a movie. the only movies starting now are "the re-deadening" and "teenage sex wager."
mr. simpson, that movie is condemned by our church's movie guide.
ah, two for "the re-deadening," please.
classic hollywood story -- the director saw my photo in a medical book.
oh yeah, there are lots of kids in it! they fall victim to a vicious--
mr. simpson, i'm scared.
dad, i don't like this movie. can we go home?
homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you.
homie, that kojak is sexier than cannon and barnaby jones put together. i think he looks a little like you.
how about a little "interrogation?"
none other! i've been hiding in your attic -- living off the moisture i can suck from the rafters!
no we didn't.
that's right. twice a week i get your email of the monkey peeing in his own mouth.
forgive me. i'm just so envious of the happiness you all have. can i please be part of it, just 'til i get back on my feet?
oh my. well, homer, maybe you should take him to moe's.
i fold. / me too. / i'm out. / i'm done.
well, i'm out of cash. but would you accept ninety-eight per cent of the outstanding shares of ziffcorp stock?
very well. achem!
achem! flush. what have you got?
it's scum like you that undermine investor confidence.
you're the majority shareholder?
all right, i admit it. i did run ziffcorp into the ground. then this man took me into his home when no one else would. and now, as a result of his brilliant card playing he's the one you want! tape his mouth so he can't deny it!
homer simpson, how do you respond to the charge that your company has betrayed the public trust?
you sir, are a moron. oh, for heaven's sakes!
hey dad, maybe this'll cheer you up. why you little... 
sorry you were wrongfully imprisoned, simpson.
oh dad, i missed you so much.
homer, i believe that's lisa.
i have to admit, i'll miss having him around.
trebulon minor...?
kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? that's how i got the channel six weather girl to start wearing a bra.
i'll write the letter.
we're gonna have to track randall curtis down and make him listen to us.
dad, that's our address.
well, northern california is wine country -- we could take a tour.
enjoy your tour, and take it easy on mr. curtis. your father and i will be across the street at the lush valley winery.
we should do more together. you're my best friend, homie.
the doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter.
the mediterranean climate is reproduced by cool pacific winds, mixed with exhaust fumes from the highway.
mmm, it goes great with the jolly rancher i'm sucking on!
"fox broadcasting, 10201 west pico, building 203..."
homie, to store the extra wine we bought, i made a little wine cellar.
well, i've been using it for laundry soap, but, okay. homie, you are so cute.
i don't talk like that.
well, you talk like marge, sorry i set the bed on fire. 
moe's tavern? that's your fun place, like me and the lamp store.
did you guys get home at two last night?
oh, my head! do you have to make such an unholy racket?
maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.
okay... and maybe you could cut back too.
i hope i can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
eins, zwei, drei, beer!
well, i don't want to be a "gloom-hilda." i guess one beer won't hurt. isn't that a little big?
have you ever walked on stilts? it's not that great.
are we home yet?
i can't believe i drove drunk.
i don't know what to believe anymore.
where's your wife tonight, homer?
what? it's 'cause of her i put in a bidet. well, it's actually just a step ladder by the water fountain.
hey, look. i've been in the bartender business for a long time alright, i've heard it all.
what are you? you're like a monster! that's like the worst thing i ever heard anybody do to anybody. you should be drinkin' watered-down beer in-in-in a chipped glass, on a stool with a nail sticking up.
oh, thank god. you're finally fighting your demons.
well, that's good too, i guess.
where's the package?
homer?
you let me believe that i'd done such a terrible thing?
i can't believe you did that to me.
of course.
yes, i really don't think you two should leave. he's a chronic alcoholic and you're in complete denial.
homie, i want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking.
well, that's no promise at all! it's important for me to see you take at least one step. then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
really? even zima?
you really mean it?
the basement, sir.
homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. homer!
sir...other customers need to use that dressing room.
we've already got an informer working deep cover on your dad. one he'll never suspect.
my baby boy is in jail! i'm the worst mom in the world.
you're a great mom. you were always there for bart with love and support. his acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
time's up!
so, why do you want to be a guard here?
welcome aboard. this end's for beating, this end's for holding.
keep away! keep away!
dad?!
his dad's a screw?
not so tough now, huh?
why would bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?
but he won't know where to go or what to eat.
i can't wait to lay my eggs in his brain.
oh bart, my troubled little lamb. you'll be in jail for so long. but i'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty.
we're having "make your own taco" night.
homie, what are you doing?
you're getting acid in the bed! i'm gonna sleep on the couch.
homer, this bachelor party seems to have peaked. would you please return my pants and/or underpants so i can go home?
grinch.
you know, homer, edna was bugging me and bugging me to set a date, and i picked one that seemed far away, and it zoomed up like a junebug flying in my windshield.
homer, lenny...my man... i could never lie to you guys. i'm starting to get cold feet. please don't tell anyone.
homer, you're still talking to me!
principal skinner is having second thoughts? poor edna!
every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
spice up! spice up!
i think skinner might make a run for it -- he's eyeing the exits and doing calf stretches.
cowabunga one to fat load.
denied.
that cloud looks awesome. that rock looks awesome. my hands look awesome.
this is so sad.
well...
drink or i'll die.
that was before i missed her smell, her warmth, her beautiful, beautiful penmanship!
really? you'll be my cyrano?
oh, that's so lovely. but it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!
i won't let edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die.
homer, marge, if i could just speak to edna for a moment.
just why am i taking your advice?
there's no ring on that finger.
as tuned as we're gonna get in this humidity.
the what now?
oh, but it can. i adore edna: she is near-mint and comes from a very limited edition -- females who will talk to me.
edna's with comic book guy? oh god, she's on the rebound! and you meet the worst guys on the rebound. it's how jackie got her "o"!
i wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
they're going into multi-purpose room b!
our marriage is just an illusion. he doesn't care how i feel at all. he doesn't know how to love.
oh, it's very sweet, but i don't need... where's that coming from? a band in a closet! every girl's dream.
i do!
please don't make us go. if you make me get on that plane, i'll give myself diarrhea! i know how!
i'm only rotting on the right side.
i'm sorry sir, the computer says the movie "chocolate star wars" doesn't exist.
like what? they'll do something with you that they hate?
the sweet love story that is older than the sea...
opinion noted. now if you don't mind, your father and i are trying to lose ourselves in this romantic fantasy.
homie, if i died, would you be sad?
stupid kids ruin everything.
homie, you know i'm usually good for a triple-x throw down, but between those kids and going to uncle tyrone's, we can't be alone.
you're never alone in this crapshack!
it's their hub. homie, look at them! honeymooners -- no kids, no worries.
not me, i do crunches.
you know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to miami!
what about uncle tyrone?
so we're upgrading you to first class.
this is so luxurious! i feel like i'm princess grace and princess di smashed together!
no!
yeah, i've never sat by a pool this long without having to apologize to someone.
seriously, with the new breast pumps, and diaper genies, and corporate flex-time, child-rearing oughta be a snap!
the kids tracked us down! our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
you're right, but where do we go?
homie, people in the other elevators can see us.
homie, the waiter's still here.
thank you, sir.
how 'bout the floor is made of lava? 
let me finish my sentence!
i don't know... homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?
you've been to space.
what did those women expect? when you sign a contract with fox, you know you're gonna be betrayed and humiliated.
do you love that sooo-weet smell of farmer billy's bacon?
would you like to see how a pig goes from loving life to your fork and knife?
you'll see the hoof grinder! the marrow sluice! and of course, the five-story pig shredder, blessed by three popes. if you like bacon, you're gonna love it. and if you don't like bacon, well then the hell with you.
okay, farmer billy's slow-killed bacon, farmer billy's bacon-fed bacon, farmer billy's travel bacon... mr. simpson, if you really want to kill yourself, i also sell handguns.
please, mr. simpson, please. i fear your smooches are premature. this is, in fact, a silver ticket.
"this silver ticket entitles you to judge the pig competition, at the springfield county fair."
this song is about a country i love -- you may have heard of it. it's called america.
i could please ms. barbra streisand / by spittin' on the flag / or stranglin' a bald eagle / on the cover of some mag / but i love this country / to me she has no sins / if you don't buy my record / then al qaeda wins!
of all the days for you to get a zit.
one more felony assault, simpson, and you're goin' down. i didn't know i could fit in a bubble. i must be losin' weight.
shall we ever see springfield's costumed protector again?
i'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the pie man.
dad, i feel like i'm gonna throw up.
he was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid.
no, i think the expression is "peg."
sorry, no refunds. oh brother. why do we get all the weirdos here at the comic book store?
you can tell by the way the pie tin sits on his face that he's very good looking.
ooh, i'll bet he's ned flanders.
pie -- popular pastry, tricky math thing, and now, sword of righteousness. a masked avenger has been giving springfield's scoundrels their just desserts.
pie man, no! it's a trap!
shoot to kill!
dad?
dad, please. it's obvious you're pie man. we've been getting his mail for weeks.
dad, this is the basement. here's the iced tea i left down here this afternoon.
you're not mild-mannered. you're often liquored-up and rude.
i want you to stop this, dad. before you get killed.
well, i know one thing you could do...
simpson, you're late, bald and stupid! i'm docking you a day's pay.
don't do it, homer! you made a promise to lisa!
tell you what, homer -- you make one last hit, then you're out of the business forever. lisa would understand.
again?
simpson! you'll rue the day you took that pie tin, poked holes for eyes, and attached a rubber band around the back!
silence! or i'll chop you into suet for my murderous gerbils and hamsters. wait, i have a better idea. you'll work for me now.
in addition to working in your normal capacity at the plant, you will also serve as my personal hit man.
do as i say or i'll tell the police. you'll do so much community service.
now open the folder. it contains your next victim.
oh, me too...
homie... are you the pie man?
well, whoever he is, the pie man would never cave in to blackmail. now, on a different subject, kiss me hard.
girl scout cookies!
grow a spine on your own time, blimpo. just one second, sweetheart. now pie that brownie, fruitcake!
ga-ga. goo-goo. your assignment.
as springfield's youngest buddhist, i am deeply honored to introduce the dalai lama.
c'mon, pie man, hit him! that's the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing!
yeah, and homer's a dumbass! no offense, homer. ya dumbass.
dad, i think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to.
i know one person who believes you were the pie man, homie... me. i've known it all along.
'round and 'round the bottle twirls, i hope it stops on one of the girls. i hope you like the taste of ringworm medicine. 
now up, the case of simpson v. simpson.
do you think it was appropriate to bet against your son's little league team?
your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
yes... and then your father broke my heart. and if i'd known he was you, i never would have married you!
granted.
let me get this straight. when you were my age, you had the hots for mom and didn't even know it? that's cool. or is it lame? i guess i'll go with lame. you're lame.
i've kissed three girls.
you're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
oh, i'm sure it's a much nicer name than homer.
what did you say?
no, no, i'd best be on me way. i'll just take some teddy grahams for the road.
the perfect kiss!
but then your father showed his true colors.
ha ha! you said "dog doo"!
i can't believe i went five minutes without one of these dream sticks.
if you are who i think you are, that girl is gone and she never wants to see you again.
what, just 'cause she smooched you? was that special?
homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant.
no, homer.
no, homer.
no, homer.
homie, i know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. i guess it didn't mean that much to you.
i wish there was some way i could believe that.
oh, homie! you did care.
but now it can have a second meaning. oh, elvis.
make mine calico!
well, that just leaves bart.
whoa, something's wrong! ah, ah, i can't hear!
i'm afraid the inoculation has swollen his ear holes shut! maybe this would be a good time to talk about side effects. the boy's hearing should clear up in a day. if it doesn't, call me in the bahamas. for now, he can express himself with this complimentary pen.
dad, he's deaf.
but mom... tomorrow's the big donkey basketball game. the kids are gonna play the teachers! donkey basketball? now i've heard everything! unlike you!
your child's behavior appalls me, not just as a principal, but as a veteran of america's only losing war.
goodbye, homer. i can't get drunk and vomit next to a guy i don't respect.
we've become pariahs! in the last two hours i've gotten one thousand hate spams.
we get it, mom.
look, what should i say to make people not hate me?
dad, i am going on a talk show. i have to say something!
but i don't hate this country.
if by us you mean loud-mouthed talk show hosts, which everyone seems to be in this country, then yes, i do hate americans!
martha! play something to lighten the mood!
well, let's see, after they blindfolded us, it was left, right, left... then a three hour plane ride.
well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. check out all the left-wing celebrities.
homer, we've got to get outta here.
i know a way out.
i'm the last registered democrat. tax and spend! tax and spend! now, if you want to escape, you can do it during the prison talent show tomorrow night.
you guys are on after al franken, so the guards will have used up most of their bullets. make your break at the end of your act.
o beautiful / for spacious skies / for amber waves of grain...
my card here says "aclu" / now look what i'm going to do...
wait right here for our encore...
dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?
does everyone remember their swimming lessons?
no.
swim toward san francisco!
there's a ship! we're saved!
the food is so delicious here. and these chanel suits are five for a dollar! i'm using a jacket as a napkin.
i wish we could go back, but i don't think we're welcome there.
name?
from now on, you're the simps!
gee, i never noticed that before. he's got a tree in his eye!
you don't sell roadside corn.
"postcard image, thing to see--" gotta go, sweetie! but i didn't read my poem!
well, at least some good came out of today.
i'll just pay the fine.
publish it myself? why not? i could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. i'd be a publisher, just like katherine graham!
thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of the red dress press, dad.
what the...? dad! mr. burns cut our power -- now i can't print my paper!
so, has your daughter always been such a righteous little rabble-rouser?
fascinating. do go on.
you saw right through me. well done! have some congratulatory drugs.
now, tell me more about your daughter. and speak into the lamp.
liberal whacko, eh? any young beaux?
dad, how could you say these things?
take my wallet and leave me alone!
look at you go. type-ity type, type, type!
the homer times?
check out the willie world news: i review the new tractors. they're all shite!
am i the only one here who's in horrible pain?
homer, what are you doing?
my, you look awfully pale. let's get you some fresh air.
just wriggle loose. i'll catch ya, li'l critter! what the family circus? a second premonition came to fruition. lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom? well i didn't need any special power to know that was comin'.
homer, i can foretell people's deaths!
uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich.
country parmesan.
don't worry, sweetie. i am not going to kill your father.
homer, please, don't tempt the gods. i-i mean god! there's-there's one god! only one! well, sometimes there's three.
uh, sure thing, citizen.
quit whackin' my barrel!
homer, stay away from the nuclear plant.
but you're gonna kill us all...
press... destruct... button. don't do it! don't do it! you'll kill everyone! do it! do it! kill everyone!
homer, i am so mad at you! i'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!
yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. the garage made it to heaven too!
homer simpson, it's time you got what's coming to you. your frisbee.
oh yeah. just stay away from the three bean salad.
prior to ingestion, the pill must be reduced by my amazing new shrink ray.
bio-nauts assemble!
now, you must enter the subclavian vein!
dad, you should listen to him. he's a man of science and you can barely read!
why is my swimsuit so revealing?
where'd you get that rib?
learning is cool!
and white blood cells are attacking my clothes! although i must admit, they know where to stop.
don't worry. we'll be fine!
oh, i feel full enough as it is.
cheer up, my chubby inner child. i've got a feeling everything's going to work out fine. because i've got you under my skin...
relax, we're just looky-loos. we're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors.
it's so beautiful and modern. ooh, a sub-zero fridge...
this is the kitchen i've always wanted. ooh, a bread maker-maker!
homie, when i married you, i knew we wouldn't live in luxury.
but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
oh, homie... that's so thoughtful, but maybe we should hire a professional contractor.
maybe you should turn off the power.
don't demolish along the way!
playdude magazines? have you been hiding bosom rags from me?
these magazines are from before we were married. maybe you should throw them away.
i like-a to kiss.
i'm not wearing any clothes. so why don't i just splay myself on a pool table!
okay, here's your precious articles.
i think you used too much plaster.
i never stopped telling you.
i'm calling a contractor. thanks for taking the job. i'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
that's all right, mrs. simpson. many husbands feel emasculated when their wife must turn to a professional to satisfy her remodeling needs.
what's the first thing you're gonna make in your new kitchen?
bart, can you come in here for a second?
it's dessert, but it's hot dogs, so it's good for you!
oh my god! someone, somewhere says i'm better than someone else!
listen here, simpson. your son has been exposing our kids to adult themes, unabashed dictionaries, and the lesser short fiction of john cheever!
ralphie wants to go on the pill!
i can't believe my mom would cheat.
oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul.
and lose her soul.
yes.
whoa, easy there, pardner. 
blood for creme! blood for creme!
bachelors are always squeezin' stuff!
it's milhouse.
i'm just spreadin' the playdude philosophy. hi-fi's, norman mailer, gettin' some...
uh... toys?
oh yeah.
because we're poor?
and then the woman...
thanks, honey, for saving me from myself.
b.f.d. i've had your scrambled eggs, homer. the secret ingredient is whiskey.
dad, the kids at school said my butt's big.
check it out, homes. you said if i ever got a hundred on a test, you'd throw me a party. there's my hundred -- where's my party?
nope, it's real -- check out the watermark.
homer, the capital of kentucky is frankfort.
see, it's all legit. now make with the party.
people, please. it's a school night.
duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck ...
it's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
next on abc, who's dropping by to see george lopez? we pray it's you!
i never meant to leave you, nelson. but uh, something awful happened when i went to the store.
i wish it were that simple. i really do.
sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
nothing. like many women, i still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight.
i guess. but there's a long way to go.
i'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
that was you.
perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.
homer, that was for the dog.
it's a media circus!
a media circus.
i didn't think anyone successful came from springfield.
technically he was born in shelbyville.
you're successful too, mom. you made a chore wheel that's both fair and wise.
mayah quimby is my er ah, fathah. give me one million dollahs!
homer simpson.
i remember you from high school. you barfed in my tuba.
homer.
i got the recipe for these in istanbul.
you know, chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place.
homer, why do you always have to show that to company?
homer, what are you doing?
did you just swallow another bone?
oh, mom, don't feel bad. everybody appreciates your... uh-oh, i'm late for my dinner... with chloe!
chloe has such an amazing life. i wonder what would have happened if i'd stuck with journalism.
yeah, i guess.
that's a sweet thought, homie.
no one's fighting over you!
homer, we've gotta get lisa!
what did i do?
i don't see lisa in any of the seminars!
she's taken my daughter to an erupting volcano? that's it! she is off the christmas card list.
booo!
booo!
we've gotta go now!
anybody i know.
mom, i wanna be just like you. i mean the lava part, not saving lisa.
...hind the 'fridgerator...
no harm done.
i'm not gonna grow up!
i thought it was chocolate milk!
well, i like t-shirts with a nice joke, like "support our troops."
ooh!
we're big fans, mr. gladwell.
you're suspended without pay! take your clacking balls and go. and on your way out, remove all the fillings you got under our dental plan.
the change magician will change your life... for the better! results may vary. machine does not actually sort change. order today!
how much?
here's fifty.
hey, homer, how's retirement?
some of us have to get up for work tomorrow.
yeah. well, enjoy the autumn of your years, jerk.
your bill, sir.
dad, the bill's only a hundred.
pathetic.
homer, use your inside voice.
...or find inclusion in the tribe by caring for vulnerable young cubs.
great! will you play malibu stacy with me?
done and done. i'm going to the organic market!
wheeee!
i can't run, i'm wearing flip-flops!
it's my entry for the all-school science fair. it shows the history of nuclear physics, from marie curie's laboratory to a scale model of the first nuclear reactor.
a robot?! last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. i don't have a chance now.
well, we're supposed to do this without parental help.
hm... what to do, what to do?
dad?...
dad, what did you do?
yes...
dad, that could explode!
homer, i want you to get that gamma radiating what's-it out of my home!
goose gladwell ripped me off and there's nothin' i can do about it. i'm just a stupid kid.
and homer, i can see you need me more than ever.
but there's spiders in the boxes.
i must warn you, sir, i was a green beret in vietnam. the things i saw there are what made me crazy.
you can't be serious.
okay, okay. here's all the money i've got.
thanks, dad.
are you sure that thing could really explode?
on the plus side, this rope is mighty soft. hm, touch it, kids.
homer, these are people you work with. show some restraint.
i'm your supervisor!
since the dawn of aviation, man has built museums dedicated to the history of flight, and created audio-visual materials to orient visitors to those museums. from the hand-drawn flip book at the wright brothers' museum... to the imax movie at cape canaveral... aviation museum audio-visual materials have taken patrons and docents alike on a rocket ride to comprehension. this is the story of those materials.
here we have a vintage film of the original springfield wing walkers, including our own agnes skinner.
i flew it at an altitude of six feet for a distance of four-and-a-half feet. then we discovered rain makes it catch fire. then the führer fired me.
i've got a bad feeling about all of this.
is your sense of outrage dulled?
now that mr. burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases.
that show's gone off the air.
uh-huh.
you have defeated the doom-bot and sealed the portal. phobos is safe.
i've got the answer!
oh thank god it's the right place. i burst into four homes before this one. now listen. all the drugs we want are right across the border. i have a friend who'll help us.
a-lo-ha!
my dad, the drug mule.
oh look, it is mr. homer, my favorite customer! please feel free to paw through my playdudes and tell me to go back to some country i am not actually from.
help me out, homer. my little roddy needs his insulin. breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing.
if you let us come, i will give you ten minutes alone with my squishee machine, do what you will.
well where's your super-team now?
but the infinite beauty-- / but the bible says--
today mounties busted a major american drug smuggling ring. former u.s. astronaut homer simpson was taken into custody.
your jacket, señor. thank god we did not stitch your name over the breast.
i just wish we could make one last big score. but we could never drive past the border patrol.
smuggle drugs in a plane? that'll never work!
i've got everything you need.
typical canadian wimpiness. that's why you have snowballs and we have the h bomb.
well, i've always wanted to see a man with the i.q. of a child executed by the state. we don't get that up here.
we're losing altitude. time to dump all unnecessary weight.
it's no use. we've got to make an emergency landing.
now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage.
way to build equity!
a roll, sir?
oatmeal?
how rude! what do i have to do to enjoy a sunday brunch with my secret other family?
i wouldn't drink that. from the looks of this place, it might kill you.
o danny boy, the pipes the pipes are calling / from glen to glen and down the mountain side / the summer's gone and all the roses falling / 'tis you, 'tis you must go, and i must bide.
hey, a beer's a beer.
do whatever you have to do to save moe's. i love my homie.
thanks, homer. no one's ever trusted me before -- except for that one guy who shouldn't have.
homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement.
m631700000642j?! this is a new loan tracking number -- you got a new mortgage?
you gave the money to moe? how's he gonna pay us back?
well, maybe i'll go to moe's too, seeing as i'm now part owner.
i would like it. you never come to my mother's.
i'm here protecting our investment. i'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
quit playing dumb.
and they seem awfully chummy.
i'm not inferring anything. you infer. i imply.
boy, what a night! moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush. here, watch. get lost, rummy!
i know, i used to think of moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. but now that i've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded.
homer, moe and i are just work friends. you and i are... marriage friends.
hey, also, i wanna....
howdy, partner! why don't you sit next to us?
uh yeah, how ya doin' there, homer? did you ever pass that g.i. joe you swallowed?
oh, marge told me. we share everything.
somethin' wrong, homer?
homer, it's time you learned the sad truth.
although there's no physical intimacy, there's a deep spiritual connection that threatens to destroy your marriage.
engage her feelings, become her friend... ooh, get her a life magazine from the week she was born. i'll always treasure mine.
oh, i'm too tired to talk.
homie, i'm tired. i have to get up early to catch my flight.
cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!
where's mom going with uncle moe?
well, if hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport.
simpson, you were going a hundred in a twenty-five zone. and you're not gonna flirt your way outta this one.
just say you love me, marge. love me like i love you. please?
homer! how'd you get in here?
you don't deserve her! you know nothin' about marge -- what's her favorite food?
he's right.
shut it! shut it!
homie...
homer, i made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. and besides... i love you. you're my homie-womie-romie-domie...
love love will keep us together
you'd better stop
i said stop
i used to love springfield park, but it's gotten so run down.
step right up, and bid on items donated by local businesses!
first up is this video camera.
sold!
fat wad! i love it!
hey homer, do fries come with that shake?
five-time rushing leader, two-time mvp and star of a disney channel movie. i played the gentle giant, "stay-off-drugs-ia".
i wanna buy the rights to that dance for a thousand dollars!
my workman-like touchdowns never make the highlight reel. but if i add your shameless shenanigans, i'll be on espn every night!
you damn straight. and i'll buy any other dances you got too.
i'll show myself out.
"the view, sir." then show ass. got it.
looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.
homer, this is lebron james. the fans love my dunks, but they hate my dancin'.
homer, you know that's when i play with neighborhood dogs!
but first, the world of sports continues its downward march into the gutter.
homer simpson, we work for the commissioner of football. and he wants to see you.
here's why we called you in: we want you to produce this year's super bowl halftime show!
fine. do it for free.
fine. pay us.
no.
i now pronounce you pac man and wife.
oh homie, don't worry. i'm sure you'll come up with a great idea.
we're ready for rehearsal, mr. simpson. so, what do we do?
yeah. i made a great film, but i'm havin' trouble gettin' it out there. i'm like michael moore, except i'm skinny, my jeans are washed, and god loves me. i just wish i could find some way to spread my message.
are you even listening to me?!
wait a minute -- you've got a medium and i've got a message. maybe god brought us together for a reason.
frank went to the men's room. i'm joe.
not in here, i don't.
you see? you see?
that was a good day too.
but i like to stand for good sportsmanship.
and with time running out, the seminoles are on the warpath!
stay tuned for sitcom sunday-
i think he swallowed the remote.
a little more color.
dad, can i go to a rap concert? tickets are fifty dollars.
okay, what if i pay for it myself?
i love you, dad.
oh did he? homer, you tell your son a rap show is not a safe place for a ten-year-old!
but you said i could go if i paid for the ticket!
don't argue with marge, i know what's best / the only rap in this crib, keeps sandwiches fresh! fresh fr-fr-fresh for mommy's baby boy
here you go, you little yellow cracker... now let's go murder our enemies. peace.
that little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!
well, time to face my punishment like a man... or, lie my way out of it like a kid.
we have kidnapped your son. follow instructions and bart will not be harmed.
thanksgiving's not for months.
do what i say and bart won't get hurt.
homer!
oh bart, i'm so glad you're okay.
a shirt from that rap concert... bart must've gone to the show. but that means...
dad!? why did you do that?
why did you burn up your shirt?
all right, people, we got a situation here. your daughter's gonna blow our whole deal sky high.
no, lisa!
wait, before we go, i took the liberty of making these embroidered conspiracy jackets for all of us.
wait a minute. why do we have to come clean? nobody's been hurt. everyone's happier with the lie.
wait just a minute.
that's a very noble sentiment, lisa. but for once in your life, can't you just be cool?
dad, i don't understand. after all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?
i hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.
lovejoy's an idiot -- his church is giving up hot gobs of gay green. he could get two hundred bucks a couple.
you are now an ordained minister.
i do.
homer, you married every gay couple in town.
well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn.
don't you push them! they've gotta work that out for themselves.
well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?
i mean a man and a woman.
straight.
a new epidemic is raging through springfield -- and this one didn't start with krustyburger's whatchamacarcass sandwich. i'm talking about an outbreak of marriage fever! reverend simpson...
i can't. i just can't. homer, have we started down a slippery slope, where marriage becomes so meaningless that anyone could marry anything?
well, call me old fashioned, but i believe that marriage described in the bible--
homer, your impulsive marriages are gonna lead to a lot of divorces.
hey saturated fats, i came to ask you a favor.
very funny.
oh no. no no. no. i'm just... surprised.
oh no. oh no. why would it be? i love you and i love gay marriage, so i'd be a super-hypocrite if i didn't love your gay marriage. right?
it smells like cheeseburgers.
is this one of those reality deals where a guy gets a million bucks for marrying aunt patty? but they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?
as opposed to you, who grabbed the first blimp that floated by.
seriously dad, i'm worried. you should go on a diet.
it was so romantic -- like a scene from a hollywood movie...
oh, i get it. you act all liberal, but you can't handle it when your sister finds love in her own locker room. marge, if you can find it in your heart to accept me for who i am, i would love to see you at the ceremony. if not, i'll see you at homer's funeral...which should be pretty soon.
selma, we'll always be there for each other. i don't know about marge, though. if she doesn't show up today...i have no non-identical sister!
i just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married.
veronica, in you i have found a soul mate. you are the perfect woman for me: truthful, honest, hiding nothing.
at last i have found the yin to my yin.
i knew it! you think everyone in the world should have a big dumb man like you!
well, i've learned a lesson. just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'.
all right. darn thing's stuck. i'll give it a good yank... gnoooooo... mes!
i'm down here, you idiot!
don't worry about that! someone's gotta greet the customers!
son, you are on fire! a million times better than that worthless old coot you replaced.
how would you like to be a full-time sprawl*mart greeter?
no.
yes. the clerk also gave me this bench warrant for dad's arrest.
how am i supposed to know if i'm twenty feet away?
homer, why did you put the screwdriver at the end?
i like eating here with you, dad. especially without "don't have a cow, man."
homer, would you be interested in the position of executive greeter?
you get to work overtime without us paying you extra.
if you don't, we'll ship you right back to mexico.
uh-huh. how sure of that are you?
it's a chance for you to catch up on all the work i'm assigning you now.
see this? it's the bathroom key. see you in the morning.
we placed a compliance chip in the back of your neck during the company physical.
homer, we took our chips out years ago.
we've learned to accept the things we cannot change. and steal everything that's not nailed down. i hope you won't judge us harshly...
homer, you forgot to eat your hot dog.
what the hell's menopause?
it's a natural process that women of a certain age go through.
don't cry, sweetie. everything's gonna be all right.
i'm not dead, idiot.
don't give up, aunt selma. china has thousands of baby girls who need adoption.
wait till the drambuie and sleeping pills kick in.
hello, homer. give me your peanuts and you can fly on my back.
oh, you are a very greedy man. the other dragons shall hear of this.
homer, i'm gonna need you to do something for me when we get to china.
homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform selma's life.
okay, don't do it for her--
do it for me.
madam wu, these are... our children, bart and lisa. yes.
thank you, mr. simpson.
these are the famous shaolin temple monks. they pursue spiritual peace through mastery of bare-fisted murder.
homer, no stop! you're thinking of buckingham palace!
boys, you see what i was talking about? the greatest things can happen.
so, mr. simpson, what do you do for a living?
homer, we need your acrobatic skills. only you can prevent this riot, and save our beloved communist dictatorship.
this is homer, your daddy. without him, i wouldn't have you.
homer, i do appreciate what you did. how'd you like a little time with "miss october"?
homer, of all the sneaky, dishonest things you've ever done, playing selma's husband was by far the sweetest.
okay, one quick snuggle.
they took my baby.
madam wu, we both love the enforcement of pointless rules. but there's a greater joy in bending the rules to help someone who thinks all hope is gone.
you may not believe this... but i once was a baby myself. my father was a ping-pong champion. he died when the ball got stuck in his throat. the heimlich maneuver was invented the very next day. my mother raised me alone, so i know it can be done. you may keep your baby. but you, drop the panda!
feast on my shorts, stupid father man.
honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. what would the kids and i do if something happened to you?
you keep almost dying. just look at our vacation photos. homie, if you die, i'm gonna have three kids to take care of. i want you to buy some life insurance. please?
mr. simpson, before we can insure you, we need to ask you some questions. have you ever had a heart attack?
strokes?
are you a smoker?
you don't smoke!
you mean when the big tuna goes belly-up?
well, i just think we should be building a nest egg.
i have a book from the library with the same information!
no more directory assistance! it's not free!
hey, hey, hey. no outside suds!
can you help me unload this soup from the car? there was a sale, so i bought four hundred cans.
oh honey, i know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away.
don't you think you've had enough "fun?" last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--
give us our independence, homer!
i, uh, was never president. i invented some kind of stove.
my scrimpings! 
did you spend our savings on a motor home?
well i hope you enjoy it, your majesty -- 'cause i'm not speaking to you!
i see. you were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? that's my half-assed dad!
i'll let you sass me!
you can wear swimsuits instead of underwear!
well, it's a pleasure to meet another sultan of the slow lane. that's my rig over there. she's a roam-a-way silvercoach. thirty-four feet of walnut-burled freedom.
i've never loved you either. we use jokes to mask our pain at the death of our son. really.
can i bring the rest of the convoy?
well, we'll give you regional beers.
homer! what are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
i know another place you can go -- to sleep!
you don't belong on the lawn. you belong in your bed with your wife!
well, you're not perfect either!
no, i don't see dad doing all that paperwork.
oh boy. let's get out of here before dad does a bad impression of mom.
and i'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your french fries. it was twenty years ago!
you don't take anything seriously. not even your bankruptcy hearing!
"dear mom and dad: we don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the rv back to the dealer." we've got to stop them.
oh, i've lost them! i can't see past all the suvs!
not good enough! kiss! french it up, lover boy!
first, raise my allowance.
look! runaway truck lane! we're saved! ah, rats.
help us!
just for that, we keep your children.
coptic christian.
hey, it's only money. and it did make a cool splash.
dude, she seemed tense, so we put a little hashish in her meal.
play?! all plays suck, all the time, and always will, and everyone knows it!
hoot! hoot! hoot! hoot!
let's see now... barely finished high school, you've challenged me to fight six times since the interview began...
"crack, smack, uppers, downers, outters, inners, horse tranquilizers, cow paralyzers, blue bombers, green goofers, yellow submarines, lsd mach three, and trace amounts of human urine!"
guards! remove this coked-out man balloon from my sight!
okay, new meat, you're clean.
no frank gehry-designed prison can hold me! ha ha!
nice nab, simpson. you did the right thing squealin' on that guy.
whatever. how'd you like to be a full-time rat?
now, now, there are perks. a private cell, extra dessert... and this adorable little hat.
so we have an agreement?
it's the only way you'll survive in here.
excellent! now, what have you got for me?
your uh, mother.
ooh, a tiffany's box! and the thing inside is from tiffany's! homie, you've never done this before. how'd you afford it?
haven't you seen what happens to people who rat in prison movies?
the prison snitch is killed! and that could be you! because you're the prison snitch!
pssst. there's a jailbreak tonight.
i sent you an e-vite. you never responded. nice netiquette, jerk.
kill the rat. kill the rat. kill the rat. kill the rat. kill the rat. kill the rat. kill the rat. kill the rat. kill the rat.
homer! homer, where are you?
oh, you must be michael's dad!
i want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
done and done, sir.
i'll have you know i buy the finest cuts of beef.
no dad, you fell asleep in front of the tv watching "the towering inferno."
kids, come down for your prom photo! oooh. smile! oh it's so great. we can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. i'm so proud of you. lisa, graduating two years early, and bart... graduating.
homer, we're separated now. you can't just walk in without knocking.
homer, just settle down. we just got a postcard from maggie. she's really enjoying alaska.
when i was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
all right! you guys are my new best friends.
watch it with the attitude, mister. you came from my back fat!
oh please, not this again.
actually, homer, i'm... into your lady.
you mean get beaten up by him?
and i'll admit, it is kinda romantic under the sea.
homer, do something about this leak!
that teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!
for he's a jolly good fellow...
this ain't for you, sweat stain. it's a surprise party for lenny, thrown by his closest friends.
i live here now. you're looking at the new owner of the little caesar's down the street. pizza, pizza. pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza. sorry. that button sticks.
we couldn't tell you ahead of time, because you'd spill the beans.
six years' planning down the drain!
oh great, homer! i bake a cake shaped like lenny's favorite barstool, and you wreck it.
welcome to knockers, hon. let me know if you see anything you like. read the sign, pre-vert.
i got my own problems. i just lost this eye last night.
look at the size of that nacho plate! i haven't seen this much melted cheese since i left my billy joel albums out in the sun.
hey, you wanna split this?
hey, my name's ray -- ray magini.
beats me -- i'm no marriage counselor. just a licensed and bonded roofer.
sure, i'll help ya, under one condition -- you gotta help me finish this pitcher of beer.
now, for my first act as president...
do that to me one more time / once is never enough / with a man like you...
homer! i woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
it means you have to fix the roof!
knockers on route 98.
i'm psychic. look, i don't know if i want a roofer who hangs out in bars.
eh, i got standards. i don't hand out high-fives like chiclets.
hey, homer.
that's what i like about you, homer. everything impresses you.
ah, this is gonna take some work. tell me, was the roof in good condition when you bought the house?
no problem. accidents happen.
hey homer!
oh sorry man, i gotta go. this says my kid attempted something. i hate the way these things cut off.
you're drooling on my goodwill pile! and why is the hole in the roof even bigger?
it's after six -- he's not coming back. he's a lousy roofer and a flake!
i don't want to hear any more about ray. tomorrow morning you buy some shingles and fix that roof yourself.
you're not married to ray!
hey homer! look, i just came down with a case of shingles.
hey, i'm real sorry i never made it back yesterday. i hope we're still friends?
what are you doing? why aren't you fixing the roof?
i'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable ray! who, by the way, i've never even met!
homer, how did you think i'd feel when i saw that?
homer, come down for dinner.
ray's not coming!
homer, i know where ray is.
sweetheart, your friend ray is in your head.
you have to understand -- ray doesn't exist.
homer!
struggle all you want, homer. there's nothing you can do. excuse us for a moment.
we'll let you go when you admit there is no ray magini.
homer, no one has ever seen ray but you.
no i didn't, dad. i saw you talking to yourself.
sorry, homer. you'll have to call me a ray-theist, 'cause i don't believe i saw him.
and here's the clincher... ray magini is an anagram for "imaginary."
actually, the technical term is electroconvulsive therapy.
when you're gettin' juiced, can you hold my turtle? i wanna bring him back to life.
homer, that's just to bite on, not to eat--
that was rubber covered in vaseline!
do you see anyone here who isn't here?
oh sorry, homer. but recent historical evidence indicates that robin hood did not actually exist.
dad!
hello, homer.
hey, no one calls me a monster and questions my existence!
check and mate.
yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all crooks. it's true.
well, homer, i could make it up to you... maybe a free eye-scraping.
homer, can i please knock off? i've got surgery in the morning.
so as i was saying, homer, mondays, nine o'clock, cbs. they say everybody loves that guy, but i don't get it.
hey, i'm just sayin', catch it while you still can.
it's monday, nine o'clock, cbs.
cbs.
nine o'clock.
monday. monday, nine o'clock.
no, television. mondays at nine. on cbs.
nine o'clock.
cbs.
monday.
television.
cbs.
nine o'clock on monday.
it's only on on monday.
nine o'clock. it's from nine to nine thirty.
not the radio, television.
cbs.
nine o'clock.
television.
oh, so i've been replaced by a machine?
my heart! it hurts so much! like it's caught in a vice!
i think he's having a heart attack!
okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. but i made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you. it's graffiti you can eatie!
where are you really going?
i'd better tell dad.
uh son, we're here to help with your... which addict-a-diddily-diction are we goin' after here?
i hate when they're over. even on the nose hurts!
tough love? of course, this has never made sense! the sign shop guy lied. stanley! you didn't question the word "luck?" now look what we've got. thanks for the correction, that's part of the honesty.
i already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner.
this fat camp can save bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. homer, maybe you could ask mr. burns for a raise.
i know how we can raise money!
how much is costed for stay-night-of-one?
let's see here. i can offer you uh, fifty dollars a week.
here's your tip, baldylocks. if you want it, dance and sing.
they want a second verse. i hope he knows it.
not for long -- i'm saying goodbye to scammer and z-dog. i've learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
when i raged against the machine, money poured out.
uh, please to have new facecloth. schnell.
to disneyland! where we will heap the scorn on goofy!
don't tell me "i didn't." that's my lucky belt. long story. good one. folks, you have three weeks left on a non-refundable weight-loss treatment. so if anybody else in the family wants to use it, use it now.
mr. simpson, you're suffering from... psi -- poor self esteem. it's not "i." every sign is wrong!
we got a long drive ahead. you wanna pull off into a motel? we'll split a room.
what are you eating now?!
you're a catastrophe. lemme have half of it.
i just want the cheese, i don't want the meat. i do want the meat.
i mean, just bite it, don't rip it. lemme have the whole thing. you'll get some later.
i smelled it, it has to be eaten.
i'm driving. i'll kill us.
call the police.
no change without purchase.
a two ounce bag of chips. five ninety-nine.
maybe we could shop somewhere else. there's a farm stand next door.
it's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins, minerals and trace amounts of bug feces.
stop it! you'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. now, close your eyes...
and if that diamond ring turns brass / mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!
why? just because she sings like whitney houston brought to life?
questioning the kid's sexuality -- well done.
how did you write a song so quickly?
i get it, i get it! she's good! looks like they love ya, kid. and the audience is always right! i wish i could say the same about my stockbroker. ah, what do you jerks know? that's a quality joke.
no, we did it, dad. i really do like working with you, dad. will you keep helping me?
but your song said you liked springfield.
la la la la la la la laaaaaaa.
i really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, dad.
really? what's wrong?
sorry, sweetie. we don't have green.
that's cameron. girls go crazy over him. he's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life.
sweetie, tonight you were perfect...
mr. simpson, i brought those twizzlers you asked for.
he's crazy!
yeah. for once, couldn't you just turn into a good father? would that be so hard?
but dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people.
i don't like sausage.
dad... you're fired.
dad, i'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. you were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business.
no one asked you to yell and slash!
hell, i'll even go shoe shopping.
you're working with cameron now?
mr. simpson, about that...
so, are you a colonel or a captain?
actually, i think your father's still upset about the way things went down.
dad, i don't want things to be awful between us. i made you some cookies.
uh, sorry hon, this is all we got. who's next?
sure. sure thing, mr. s.!
thanks, dad.
dad, you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we've spent together. i don't care if i win, just as long as you're in my corner again.
dad, you sabotaged cameron for me!
well, i think you're the sweetest dad in the whole world.
now you're getting creepy.
oh. i see. well, good luck getting to your precious mall barber, 'cause i'm not driving you.
dad?!
leave your body, seymour. leave your body.
church? i'd rather play golf on the holiest day of the week.
it's the rapture, shawna. the rapture. the virtuous have gone to heaven, and the rest of us have been... left below!
it's the title of the movie.
why did i choose to be gay?
sweetie, don't worry. god wouldn't spring the rapture on us unannounced. he'd send us signs, like, i don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving.
ooh, i could be the rachel to your jacob.
you too.
can i help you? we're having a sale on bible magnifying glasses.
yes, this one is fifteen per cent off.
and would you like to take advantage of our "friends of flanders" discount?
homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. and you're reading books! word books! what's going on?
three million, one hundred and--
may eighteenth? that's one week from today!
this is kent brockman reporting live from downtown springfield, where overweight doomsayer homer simpson is predicting the world will end... next wednesday! homer, what turned you from sad drunk to mad monk?
i see. well, we have thirty seconds left -- any other cuckoo yip yap?
homer, i'm glad you're getting exercise, i just wish it wasn't crazy exercise.
dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. yet. a hundred years, global warming... we're goners. but for now, do you think you could lighten up on this "left below" stuff?
'cause that girl's school says i can't do that no more.
that's springfield mesa! it's fifteen miles north, past the warren harding memorial through-hole!
well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-rapture party.
dad, please don't go through with this. all through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong.
lisa's going! we're all going!
wait for me! i'm a-comin'!
two... one...
there appears to be some delay!
homie... i'd better start dinner.
dad, if you'll recall, i never believed in you, not for one second.
hey, fatwad! here's another thing you didn't predict.
yeah, school.
we're not going anywhere, except to bed!
homer simpson! welcome to heaven. now let's get you some clothes, huh?
this is our nature walk... our pedicure hut... our state-of-the-art showroom, tonight featuring los lobos. and over there is our water slide, that's coming next year. it's gonna be super fantastic.
look, just don't use leprechaun labor. okay? don't do it. and the best part of heaven is, anything you wish for, you get... lickity split!
so if you need further assistance, just call the front desk and ask for andre, okay?
you know you could wish for some.
homer, what's wrong?
oh, don't tell me about family suffering. my son went down to earth once. i don't know what you people did to him, but he hasn't been the same since.
pass.
hey, what's the big idea, pally? why so crabby?
squandered my gift? i made sixty-eight albums.
what do you want, homer?
but it's already started. to do what you're asking, i'd have to turn back time.
you want me to help you with your alcoholism?
why don't you just take these pamphlets?
the warren harding through-hole never seemed so long.
in our second hour... humorist david sedaris takes a wry look at overcrowding in america's prisons.
hey, i won four free movie tickets! and it starts in half an hour!
a tv shark is not a babysitter!
howdy, homer. you here for a viewin' of my shampooin'?
oh, sorry, but i promised to rewind videotapes for the poor.
all right, neighbor, i'll baby-sit.
yeah, so i can't see my own shrinky dink.
honey, you can be anything you want to be.
would you care for a segment?
mom, i don't wanna read -- it's the weekend!
he doesn't even know what's going on!
and you say mr. flanders remains completely ignorant of their dot-kama sutra?
boy, nothin' is sexier than still photos in a girlie magazine. wha?
what are you two doing?
it's happening in ned's house! why would he allow that?
c'mon. you tell him right now. ned, homer has something to tell you.
you know what i mean.
homer, is this true?
the bible says "cast your bread upon the waters." but all i got was a bunch of soggy bread.
don't say it, homer. this is not the time.
dad, i don't think you realize what you've done. you've totally humiliated the best friend the simpsons ever had.
that's what we've been trying to tell you!
the flanders family has pulled up stakes. you have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
well, homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. but at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?
damn straight. clay roberts. i coach wrestling, so everyone calls me coach.
that's coming from next door!
that's too bad, 'cause my twins are just wakin' up, dude. encourage me!
louder!
just say "go! go! go"!
chop shop! chop shop!
yeah, something tells me you won't starve. huh? huh chief? huh?
relax, dumbass. oh, by the way -- i borrowed some gas from your car. you dumbass.
huh? what are you doing? reminiscing... like a woman?
homer? what are you doing here?
well, that is true. in fact--
really? well that's too bad, 'cause i'm not leaving. see, i like this place, and i've already got fatso here broken in. ain't that right, fatso?
oh yeah, tell it to the marines! okay, i give! why'd you do that? i was beggin' for mercy.
homer! did you steal the organ from the church?!
well, you've gotta take it back! it sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. mind if i waggle my finger a little bit?
bart, i love you. but sometimes i don't love your choices. now we have to find another school for you.
think of the leg up you'd have!
i need two double a batteries. now!
what if there's a fire?
catholic schools are usually the most affordable private schools.
my pacemaker!
don't you touch bead one! homer, maybe we should be concerned. catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on friday...
yes'm. anima patri, et filio, et spiritui sancto...
that's latin, dad. the language of plutarch.
we're having our monthly pancake dinner. care to join us?
¡que buenos cake-os de pan-o!
i understand. but can it wait 'til after bingo?
bingo.
how 'bout you just say "yay, i won."
i've never seen such masterful bingo playing. what's your secret, homer?
i'll admit the vow of celibacy is one of our sterner challenges.
well that's true, but if you do break a rule, you can always find absolution in the sacrament of confession.
if you truly repent, then yes.
um, not quite, mr. simpson. i can only absolve you if you're a catholic.
...but it ends with bread and wine.
homer, you've been out all night! and you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. were you at that catholic church?!
i knew they'd try to convert you! that's what they do! well i'm not having another twelve kids.
forget it! and you know, i went to a catholic wedding once. the incense ruined my pantsuit!
where's homer and bart?
yes, homer?
oh, we've gotta stop 'em now! once they seal the deal, there's no turning back. like the jews with their snippity-snip.
it wasn't a fair fight! your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting cinemax.
well, i'm gonna show bart that protestants can be hip too. how do you like those croutons?
strange as it sounds, dad, i agree with you.
oh bart, i knew one of these dumb things would work! my hive! my trademark hive!
we got a real nail-biter here at mile-high stadium, the broncos down by one, and thirty seconds left on the clock.
well, now the bear has a surprise for you. he's not really a bear... he's a tiger! oh looky there, denver just won the ballgame...
who's professor pigskin?
how is that possible?
i get it. every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think professor pigskin is always right! that's when they ask for your money.
dad, it's a scam!
look, all i'm saying is, you really should think twice before...
dad, how much money did you bet?
if he mentions that pig again, use two hammers.
yeah. it's called "lemony lick-it: a series of horny events".
well, i got these free tickets to santa's village. i know a guy who turns the dead sleigh-horses into jerky and sells it to bars...
i want to see santa. he can explain why he gave me a playstation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.
homer, before i take the kids, i want you to swear you're not up to something.
and i'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
what is this, a reunion of "fahrenheit 9 on 1?"
homer, how'd you ever get marge to go along with this?
homer! is this a snuggle film?!
how could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!
all right.
away from you.
i don't know.
you are.
boy, homer. i've never seen mom this mad.
bye bart! i love you, lisa! sleep tight, maggie! today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!
she should be back now. it's dinner time.
all we've got is ketchup.
no. i mean ketchup.
hey, homer.
you told me to call. you wanted to see if your phone was workin'.
well ain't you got call waitin'?
hey, homer.
be still! don't give it the phone! settle down, sugarplum. look what daddy's got in his pocket. yummy, yummy kelp. good girl. yes, yes. this animal means you no harm. she's a sweet old florida manatee. also known as a sea cow or a dugong.
oh yes, señora left for the coast with a rugged, yet sensitive man of science.
dad, i don't think we're gonna find mom today. and i'm sick of eating at restaurant chains i've never even heard of, like skobo's and dim willie's. ew.
country cousins? are they rubes? 'cause i don't cotton to rubes.
can we say it's my birthday and get free stuff?
we're having lasagna and caesar salad.
so, homer, how are you?
and how is our lovely marge?
oh, why that's terrible!
what am i supposed to do, bury them at arlington?
homer?
ooo.
homie, i accept your apology.
but i'm not coming back yet.
i've found a place where i'm needed.
i'm sorry, homie. i just can't find it in my heart to come back right now.
homer, i have no interest in stealing your wife, but marge is getting something from her work with me. something a strong, passionate woman like her needs: a purpose.
she doesn't love me. she's just trying to find herself.
i don't know everything. i'm just a man.
saving!
aw man, i just wish we could see their tears.
in fact, they're bigger than us.
you're a brave man. and we respect two things: bravery and tattoos that look like barbed wire. let's go.
what did you call us?
homer, are you okay? how many fingers am i holding up?
oh, my sweet, sweet homie! you sacrificed yourself for the manatees.
i'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband.
and i always will.
amen.
don't you have to be back at work?
it's seven a.m. what are they cock-a-doodily-doin'?
okily-dokily, here's some french roast, now i'll go make toast.
a stamp museum?
well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. what ever happened to "please" and "thank you"?
we have to stop all this construction. the noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the jell-o.
instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
oh sure you can, sweetie. just don't make a habit of it.
so that's why i've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
lisa, honey. i know last night was tough, but all our kids sleep by themselves. we don't even hear maggie cry at night anymore! oh, wait a minute. there's no batteries in this thing.
tonight i want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... homer, stop that!
homer, can you help me out here?
dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house.
hey, simpsons! that'll be forty bucks!
yeah, that's per axle. park over there in carl four. no early outs!
oh, yeah. living next to the stamp museum is making me a mint. i bought a diamond for my bellybutton! you guys need water?
thanks to me, katherine blodgett, we have non-reflecting glass.
and i'm jumbo shrimp! maximum two servings!
what a lousy party. i don't care what apu was in a past life. in this life, he's a blabbermouth!
i know. i'm sorry.
is it the chair?
grampa?
what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? hm?
well, i hope he's accompanied by the "how was your day" monster, and the "foot rub" monster and the let me just...
all i see is an empty grave. why don't you fill it, ya lazy bastard?
what about bart's bedroom?
yeah.
ow.
did you bring those home movies of your daughter i asked for?
who was filming that scene?
four thousand dollars?!
i'm not chasing you, mr. simpson.
homer!
new pony?
maggie! that's not what you do with a hymnal. homer!
heal my scabs, lord!
sweetie, i know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching! no! no!!! here, here play with your teddy bear. oh, sugar-booger!
homer, don't touch her! you've never had chicken pox.
oh, i'm just saying it's very dangerous if you get it as an adult! it could leave you sterile down there.
mmm. don't worry, dad. i'm saving one for you. i'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.
hey homer, why the sour puss? didja chugalug a skunky snapple?
really? do you mind if i bring my boys over so she can infect rod and todd? then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
au contraire, man with no hair! you see, rod and todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!
you betcha! in fact, some parents have been known to hold "pox parties," so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please.
well, they might. but you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors...
...normally i'm not one to laugh at a man's urinary blockage, but, you shoulda seen it... oh, there he is.
all right! i never drank one of these without a cigarette in it!
almost anyone's got a chance now.
all right, we get it!
oh homie, you got chicken pox. but how?
you sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! homer!
stop eating the oatmeal! that's the third tub you've eaten!
milhouse! i need slender fingers to get me a pickle! this isn't mine. i have a message for your wife: stop sleeping with my husband!
the wife of your wife's lover!
you moron! marge is having an affair with kirk!
never mind about those two. just answer me one question. how did your wife's bra end up in my husband's bed?
oh boy, am i beat! if you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!
how could you ask me that?
homer, you're crazy!
fine... no!
no, no, no!
you don't trust me? after i salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! how dare you! get out of this house!
dad, i thought mom kicked you out of the house.
lisa, we don't need to know how. it's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war.
where are you staying?
so, i got your note saying you wanted to meet here to apologize.
where's my apology?
this is all my fault! i planted mom's bra in milhouse's parents' bed!
homer! i can save you both! just let go of the rock! just do it! trust me!
mom... dad. i'd give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
homer!
well, i guess you showed you do trust me after all.
i'm afraid your son is in a deep, deep coma from which he will never emerge.
a robot?
sure. let him have it.
david is so helpful...
more waffles, father?
did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
i will comply.
i hate going to the zoo. i feel so sorry for the animals.
what are you talking about?
we're still going to the toy store, right? and i can pick out as many toys as i want?
you told me he was at culinary school!
to get me, you'll have to go through your fa...
well, the important thing is we're a family again.
i'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
please don't accept this invitation, dad. hunting is cruel.
and there's bananas in that tree up there.
you can't escape me, simpson -- you're not smart enough!
done and done!
staying out eighteen hours and not calling home once.
i'm turning you into your costumes!
but what will junkies do drugs under?
whoa, sir, we're dismantling this ride. it's not safe.
robusto is not for sale! but would you like to buy my last dumbbell?
a bicycle built for two! and i could be one of those two! homie, if i buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me?
our tandem bicycle! when i bought it, you said you'd ride with me.
i'd love to! i'll be right... wait... are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
awww. i'll be right down.
don't do that... that hurts. careful, careful.
homer, how'd your right arm get so strong?
oh no you don't! i just got an idea.
gimme a bottle of bourbon! i got a new liver, and i'm breakin' it in.
where are you two going?
uh-huh. and how will this affect your job at the power plant?
oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. have fun!
forget about it, homer. she's dead to you now.
oh, marge called you. she said... uh... that she loves you and she hopes you break the guy's arm so hard that it pokes through his skin.
yeah. she said to shut up, and stop asking questions and listen to moe.
now homer, you gotta keep your head in the game, all right? your first opponent is lefty "the righty" leftwright.
yeah, he only lost once: in his fight against illiteracy.
c'mon, homer! we can make it all the way to the quarter-finals for the eastern division, class b, over thirty-five, amateur grouping!
sweet home alabama / where the skies are so blue
i thought it was arm wrestling.
ooh, my little pretty one, my pretty one / when you gonna give me some time, sharona / ooh, you make my motor run, my motor run / got it comin' off o' the line, sharona / never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind / i always get it up for the touch of the younger kind / my, my, my, aye-aye, whoa! /
mid-june?
dad, there's no such thing as "father's day eve."
fine, there's a daddy claus.
bart... lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.
here you go, dad. i hope you like it. i've forgotten what it is.
oh captain, you're so handy!
the unicorns are you and me, dad. i drew it myself. what do you think? huh? huh? pretty heartfelt, huh? huh?
you didn't like it, did you?
oh dad, how could you?
she's not going to get over this quickly -- i know women.
you what?!
i'm not a baby! a baby is zero to two.
i'd rather not go than lie.
mr. and mrs. simpson, i'm afraid we have a real problem with lisa. your daughter broke a window, upended an ashcan, and hurled a thermos-brand thermos onto the street!
i'm afraid lisa's rage stems from extraordinary disillusionment with a parental figure. in this case, her father.
mr. simpson, lisa is at a crucial juncture. if she doesn't see her father as a positive role model, she could hate men for the rest of her life.
if i may make a suggestion. the school is looking for a new "safety salamander". when lisa sees you teaching children to avoid downed power lines, it could restore her faith in you and the male gender.
uh... he fell asleep in the suit and suffocated.
i guess.
school buses don't have seat belts.
a metal bar at tooth level.
are you a girl? 'cause i don't see a sala-wiener.
ooooh! ahhhh!
janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. couldn't you be that kind of dad?
oh, yeah.
springfield needs a hero and it needs one now!
my mother's still in the car.
three cheers for our new hero!
okay, six!
hip, hip hurray! hip, hip hurray!
dad, we've got to do something.
lincoln was only one man.
look, as the safety salamander, you are beloved by all. and if you were the mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do.
and i will be your campaign manager!
homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that salamander suit. you look like the mascot for some horrible southern college.
uh, what special powers would a salamander bring to the office of mayor?
mr. simpson, what about those photos of you strangling your child?
i, um, i don't feel so good, blue.
what's that smell?
did you just vomit in that suit?
have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?
i'd better wash that thing. it's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
no!
sir, how would you restore our city's crumbling infrastructure?
we're sick of you and your hatchlings!
well, dad, you tried to make this town a better place. and no matter what, that makes you my hero.
yeah, i warned you about that.
you don't have a tail anymore.
you're lisa's brother!
sir, you wanna set the baby down? don't worry, i just want to talk.
tea? in the parlor?
this is my husband homer.
way to blow our tea, marge. that's the last refrigerator magnet calendar you get from me!
my husband... and my best friend!
we're on food stamps?
i'm going out for some air.
for your information, i am now a junior member of the cheery red tomatoes.
oh... uh... uh... bird watching.
grazie. idioto! idioto! idioto! idioto!
i got the combination from burns after i let him feel me up during the depression. zero to the right... zero to the left... back to zero.
try to take my eggs will you? well, this rooster has a beak! a beak which calls out death-a-doodle-doo! why... you're all women!
i suppose, but you're certainly buxom and flirty.
oh, no jury on earth will convict a bunch of moist-eyed mothers. i'll tell you what, ladies, give me my eggs back and i'll let you go.
simpson!
i just bought a new car. a nice foreign number... the lamborgotti fasterossa.
yes, i need you to pick up my car at the factory in italy, and ship it directly back to me. i'll save thousands in taxes!
yes!
sure.
i think dad may blow your cover.
ooh, marriage!
gee, i wish we could explore a little more of italy.
why don't you encourage him to get us some health insurance?
dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?
when mount vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death.
we've passed the ponte vecchio bridge three times. i think we're lost.
that's a dvd of a fellini movie!
mozzarella! parmigiano! provolone! pecorino! gorgonzola! fontina! tallegio! bocconcini!
it doesn't cover mortadella.
maybe there's a mechanic in this tuscan village.
scusi?
ehhh... americano?
hey, she says the mayor speaks english.
how did you wind up here?
my tale begins after i had once again attempted to murder bart...
this is my bride, francesca, and my son, gino.
well... i experimented in college, as one does.
bob, you haven't told your wife about all the terrible things you've done?
and literature is filled with tales of redemption, from jean valjean to the voice of buzz lightyear, tim allen.
dad, don't act like mussolini!
here's a cute fact. this sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.
i feel so sick.
where is my roadster? you were due back a month ago!
sideshow bob! dad, you're driving on an ancient roman aqueduct!
hey, krusty's in an opera, here in rome! he can save our lives! come on, let's go!
tell ya what, put on these costumes, go on the stage and mix in with the crowd scenes. he won't kill ya in front of all those witnesses.
dad, the phantom isn't in this.
that's sideshow bob!
when a wife looks like that / and her husband's so fat, that's amore! / when she kisses that jerk / while i do all the work / that's a...
where's reverend lovejoy? he's never been late for christmas service.
now there's no one to deliver the sermon!
i wanted you to tip me!
that's not my decision!
ohhh...!
it's not over, it's just intermission!
merry christmas, homie. i think you're really gonna like this.
i knew you'd forget, so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me.
so tell us, what's next for william h. macy?
homie, what's wrong? did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?
can i help you?
i'd be delighted. but i must warn you, i don't wear a sweater every day.
no, actually i salvage valuables from sunken ships. some call me a treasure hunter.
those are raisins.
and this is the lady in my life.
indeed i do. i loved a real woman a long time ago but uh... it didn't work out.
listeners? i thought you worked for a newspaper.
viewers? wouldn't that be for a tv station?
wha...?
dear god. i always dreamed this day would come. and now that it's here, there are so many feelings... i -- i...
homie, you just met this british man. it's too soon to get so emotionally invested.
and now that treasure is somewhere down there.
i was busy telling young people to get a haircut.
this guy.
today i'm filled with joy: searching for treasure with my long-lost son. my dream for each of you is that you find the happiness i feel today.
these waters contain some of mother nature's most stunning creatures.
how do i talk? push this button here? you're all losers!
grab daddy's keys! i love that little guy... what the... hey...
aw... it's beautiful. homer, on your wedding day, i want you to have this. it may not be much, but it's all i've got.
i gave you everything and it still wasn't enough.
well homer, now that you're alive again, i'll leave you with your real family.
of course.
i love you too, homer. and now there's something i've gotta tell you: i really am your father.
i switched the names on the dna samples. then i put my name first on the list for a new heart. my old one's fine, but ya never know.
it would be my pleasure... son.
anything, son.
all right, nap time.
it's the only place cruel enough to straighten bart out. they use a proven concept, "tough hate", to turn around foul-mouthed hooligans. then they send them home, quietly ticking away.
hey, check it out -- i made it partially risqué.
dad, if you take me to vegas, i'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack.
what's your system?
it seems he was our problem before. your son's on the no-fly list.
well homer, looks like i can't go to discipline camp. which is too bad, 'cause i think this was the thing that would finally straighten me out.
dad, neither of us wanna go. why are you doing this? where's the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose?
fight back, fun homer! together we can win!
c'mon, dad, we got a long way to go. you can't stay mad at me the whole time.
well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing i'm good at.
actually, justin and i are going to the oregon shakespeare festival. sir peter hall himself is directing.
did you see that? they were eating melon for breakfast!
well dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame.
well, i guess it's tinkle time.
so, here for a snack before they roll you back into the ocean?
how 'bout if i just shoved a pig down your throat? i'm kidding.
what?! no one dashie-dine on stavros!
hm, if i save you, what are you gonna do to me?
dad, i think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer.
well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, i wouldn't be so screwed up.
don't worry, mr. simpson. we're gonna take his "sass" and turn it into "siss."
don't gamble on my love, homer!
i've learned so much in my three hours here. i don't have to play pranks to feel good. i can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.
dad?
i'm gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!
actually, we were gonna call you, mr. simpson. your credit card was declined.
homer, i hope you get this. i'm in jail and i need ten thousand dollars bail. hurry!
well, tell your regular bully. he won't like it one bit.
sir, your go-cart's damaged.
well, let's see... oh, to have me shack rebuilt / get my rotten teeth all drill't / something on underneath me kilt / oh, wouldn't it be adequate? / matching shoes for both me feet / dining on untainted meat / a toilet what still has its seat /
big blue pants. when you no longer care if you're attractive to women.
of course, but how?
well, what have i got to lose, besides the factory that's been in my family for generations?
homie, what's that?
on the back of your head.
well, it creeps me out! wow, it glows in the dark.
and where should it not go?
dad, get your own song.
i'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
what are those doing there?
"local anahoopi indians believed this stalactite was the finger of tsisnajini, their god of pointing down."
it's so impressive.
that was two firemen, a crane and snow white.
well, we better start looking.
i'll stay with you, dad.
sure. once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom--
one day, while i was savoring the exclusivity--
yeah -- it's like the play within a play in "hamlet."
let's see... it's like when you watch old home movies of you watching tv.
scavengers... scavenge!
hey bar-boy, write a play where i meet henry ford and captain kirk.
i'm a little busy. can i do it later?
but on the upside, i found some cave paintings and made them awesome. 
aw geez.
mr. burns got his plant back, and i like to think i found a shred of humanity in his withered soul. aw dad, did my story make you cry?
that was the most horrible part of all!
oh the yellow gold of texas / is what i wanna save / i will not pay no taxes / if i hide it in a cave
i need an operation?
why does god always need money?
how can you be sure?
and the winner is--
there, there... the fact that you tried means everything.
hey marge, i don't i don't really want a computer. you know all those complete strangers googling each other. makes my flesh crawl.
let's do it again!
¡ay, el mundo es loco!
homer! we're not in high school.
maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the s.a.t.: "snuggles and tickles."
hey homer! sneakin' kisses from the missus?
dad, mom's over at the flanders', babysitting nimrod and nimtodd. we wanna do something.
uh... sure.
this is much sadder than i expected.
cheer up, toot-toot. have some of my ice cream.
help! she's grooming me! she's grooming me!
i'm afraid there's nothing we can do now. a chimp that size could tear your son's head right off.
where's bart? i haven't seen him since you came home.
i didn't say that.
i could never think something that horrible.
dad, you can't keep this up for long.
whoa! this oreo is rank.
whee. whee.
maybe there's another way to solve this. bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for toot-toot.
while you were living the glamorous life of a tv chimp, i was raising my son. you have no right to take him away from me now. please, please, give me back my boy.
hey, i know how we can save bart.
maybe he's getting married!
i'm not wearing a hat!
that's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
i've never seen a picture so highly defined!
you don't mean that literally, of course.
mom didn't say anything about high-def!
wow, there's a rainbow outside.
and bodell jenks the third crashes into bodell jenks! the winner is, bodell jenks junior!
beat it! this is my alone time!
i ain't fallin' for that again.
homie, i've been thinking. we have been using this tv for a long time. so i entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen tv.
now i really hope we win that contest.
congratulations, mr. simpson. you've won!
no. no one wins that. you won third prize: a tour of the fox network in los angeles, california.
ooh, why look, there's dan castellaneta from the tracey ullman show.
please don't lean out of the tram, sir, you might get hurt.
oh, about enough to buy a new plasma tv.
not so fast. are you sure you want your most intimate moments broadcast across the country?
what are you doing, homer?
well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives.
i got my tenure at twenty-eight.
i got my tenure right here.
you can call me charlie. but do not call me late when there are scones about. little british humor.
i don't understand, dad. our family has so many flaws. why must we share them with the world?
but dad...
forget it.
oh, you needn't worry. i'm a bit of an elbow man, myself, actually. a bit different, a bit weird. not sexual.
well, i thought there was no further way i could humiliate my husband. and then this opportunity came along.
you know, i despise my husband.
charles hasn't satisfied me in years.
cruel, dusty years!
now homer, would you care to give your report on "c.s.i. miami?"
homie, i missed you so much! put your pants back on.
where is she? where is the soul-sucking she-beast i call "sweetums?"
you're leaving me for him?!
what brought us together is how much we hate you.
about a class of remedial reading students and their teacher who wants to be taken seriously.
and that's not your strong suit, big guy.
homie, you've been down here for a week, i really think you need- what the hellmann's real mayonnaise?!
it's so strange that the commissioner didn't show up.
i am never coming back to this city -- and neither is the league!
that's right! the springfield meltdowns football club shall never be!
homie, you should give your dad a call. you can't stay mad at him forever.
no! wait! wait! bullfighting is a cruel, pseudo-sport!
hell, yeah!
grampa simpson's movements are tentative. as if he is distracted. distracted as if by a moral dilemma. a moral dilemma posed by a young boy... no, a girl! a girl named linda... no, lisa! the flutter of the cape tells all.
before we begin the movie, please join me in a moment of silence for the workers who gave their lives in an heroic --
however, federal law requires i keep one union worker on the payroll. so congratulations, whoever catches this bouquet.
you've been transferred to india!?
luxury? this thermostat is just painted on.
aw dad, we'll miss you so much.
attention: india air flight fifty-seven. now boarding first class, small children and fat guys.
homie, i got you something to read on the plane.
it's a book about management, and lee iacocca says it's "definitely, dot dot dot useful."
hello?
calm down, dad. what happened?
no.
yes, oh, you must be mr. homer!
classic. now, tell them how to run a nuclear plant!
dad, i've gotta write a report on the great lakes.
also, i can't sleep at night 'cause there's this new bully who follows me home and... i think he's in the house!
simpson, i don't know how you're doing it, but you're outputting ten times the power our american plant ever did.
i see what you're saying. we're crowding your plate. in fact, there's no need for us to be here at all. let's go, smithers.
now if you'll excuse me, i'm late for a dinner engagement. i don't want my scooped-out monkey head to get cold.
actually, in our system of belief, there are many gods.
a-bom-shabai! a-bom-shabai! a-bom-shabai! a-bom-shabai!
homie, stop! you're not a god!
oh yeah? what's mom's birthday?
it's may!
i'm proud of you, dad. you're the first man to ever outsource the american worker's sense of entitlement and privilege.
he was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
when is our food gonna get here? i'm starved.
what about this swordfish?
finally, we shall bid goodbye to england and its drunken, decadent sinners.
mother, we must protect him. look, he's praying.
and i will make thee a hat from construction paper!
good sir, i do not approve of your fleshly gaze.
i see you met our devout leader, ned flandish.
now i gotta warn ya, even for this day and age, i'm considered a bad husband.
well, i'm sure the way to win her heart is to be fat and crying.
perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
stop callin' it that!
homer, i can't believe i was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!
witch! witch! witch!
they're looking at me 'cause i have the key to the stocks.
at least i'm pitching!
who else has a story?
in your face, julio. i'll be fetchin' yer food right away. six more games.
hey, you schmuck -- get off-a me! goin' out with a sight gag. nice.
lord, with you watching over me i shall feel no pain. 
homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!
homer, what should we do?
i've tied it off. you're all going to make it. tell the world... that i saved you all.
dad, taking the family to opening night is the nicest thing you've ever done for us.
i can't wait to see this re-imagining of itchy and scratchy... by avant-garde director juliana krellner!
and dynamite igniting!
all this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly. women are as smart as men. why, a woman invented liquid paper.
well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper.
um... i-i think a woman came up with nylon stockings. i mean, probably. we certainly use them.
mom, i don't think this will fool anybody.
he's one of bart's friends.
you never take our kids to the movies.
i don't know. i'm still frowny with you. do you really think women are mentally inferior?
well, then we're gonna leave you one digit short.
dad, all you had to do was paint one number. now no one's gonna be able to find our house.
hey sal bando, give him a '74 a's "thank you honk."
i have a delivery for a scott and brenda weingarten, seventy-four evergreen terrace.
oh, no problem -- i'll just ship these juicy mail-order steaks back to omaha.
dad, isn't it wrong to open or eat other people's mail?
oh dad, no one can rationalize like you.
this is kent brockman, in the springfield keys, reporting to you from the middle of a hurricane! the lid from my coffee cup is long gone. i'm scared, people. truly scared.
homer, this says i've won homemaker magazine's "clean for a day" contest! "a highly skilled professional will come to your home, and clean it top to bottom while you relax." but how could i have won? i don't subscribe to this periodical.
it's hard to say. with retrograde amnesia such as this, the patient can forget years and years of her life. you just have to keep jogging her memory till it works.
i didn't say you should be jogging.
although you should be jogging.
oh, you're sweet. i'm lucky to have such a kind... uncle?
wha--?!
but you're so much more... ravaged than i am.
i may have lost my memory, but i'm not an idiot.
oh it's great. like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
you strangle your child?
it hurts when i swallow.
who are those freaks?
i know what the sun is.
it's so great to have my children back.
nope. i'm sorry, admiral, but you're still a stranger to me.
i'm sorry. you seem like... a colorful character, but i just don't remember you.
what's snuggling?
mr. simpson, i don't even know you -- i'm not making love with you!
you're describing how to parallel park.
we've got to tell dad!
mr. simpson?
that homer simpson / he's quite a guy / he paid me ten bucks / so i would lie / the truth is / he's not so great / he is the one man / i tru-ly hate...
i've had a lovely evening, mr. simpson.
know what? no! i'm not the kind of girl who makes love on a putt-putt golf course!
that sounds horrible!
i'm sorry you have to leave. but i just can't think of another way.
my grades will suffer! in fact, they're already suffering. look at this garden of f's. you planted them all!
that works for hiccups, not amnesia.
how long you gonna be bunking with me, son?
don't answer it yet -- savor the sound.
who the hell are you?
go on.
dude, she's got three kids.
you drink?
i remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
oh, i don't...
oh, and her.
uh-huh. and him.
i don't recognize that name.
oh, i know all them!
wow, she still works here?
oh, i always liked that guy!
oh, and there's a familiar name. and another one. wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? did he get married?
i just had my first kiss.
weaving?! homer, you're my father, you're supposed to protect me from things like this!
sorry, loom-wads, new exhibit's in town.
not if i spend the whole time running around like this. die, weapons, die!
wait, wait, ho-hold the phone there homer...
yaaay!
imax 3-d films presents: "nunchucks: cool but useless." the nunchuck was invented thousands of years ago by a chinese monk. artifacts of the time indicate that this incident was hilarious.
you're leavin' already? we, we haven't even gotten in yet.
so, according to creationism, there were no cavemen.
dad, you're not really reconsidering evolution, are you?
why, i believe right now this gentleman's havin' dinner with the tooth fairy and the easter bunny.
now, bambi, who started that forest fire that killed your mama? evolution? my, my, my.
homer, please.
don't worry lisa, i've got the answer to your problems right here. look, homie, i brought you a beer.
as sure as i am that jesus hates hip hop!
as a matter... homer...
this court hereby rules that the law forbidding the teaching of evolution is repealed.
that was two seasons ago!
homer, we need those tickets to get in!
i concur!
homer? homer? now we have to kiss. the big tv is telling us to!
give me a kiss, homie.
for the last time, no!
hey, that was my iced tea. i just sweetened it to my liking!
evenin', ma'am. i uh... couldn't help seein' you two exchanging marital kisses tonight.
i was wonderin' if you and the mister could give us some marriage counseling. ya know uh, in return, i can give you season tickets.
homer, can i see you in the kitchen?
homie, i don't think our marriage is so jim dandy that we should be counseling others.
well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life.
that's what i want -- carefree intimacy, with no edge of resentment!
buck, tabitha, welcome. we'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as homer gets here.
well, i'm an old-fashioned guy you know, and when we got hitched, i just assumed she'd give up her international recording career to focus on my minor-league baseball dreams.
well, i'm positively sick of her shakin' her lady parts for the whole world to eyeball.
maybe we should stop here.
uh yeah, sure.
isn't it weird that our parents are giving marital advice? they're always fighting -- if you listen closely, you can hear them arguing right now.
this house is spectacular. you must have had a great view of the riots!
you make me laugh, homer.
oooh.
i always say that.
hey, why don't you stay and have a bite?
oh homer, you're sweet, but... oh, you're talking to the chicken.
listen, these shows always tense me up. while your fingers are greasy, could you give me a neck rub?
homer simpson! you're supposed to be my marriage counselor. i did workbook pages for you!
there ain't gonna be a three o'clock.
dad, because you and mom screwed up buck mitchell's marriage, some kids beat me up at school today.
oh, papa.
listen, bub. we are out of the marriage counseling business. and the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. but not me, 'cause i think they're disgusting.
then i guess you'll do it without me.
where are you, sweetie?
well, homer, it looks like my marriage is going into extra innings.
no problem.
actually, you can really keep costs down when you don't pay for materials or labor... or permits... or land.
homer!
you said you meant to make brownies. any other lies?
oh michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower.
with fat tony doin' the morphine mambo, the calabresis are gonna try to put him down for a dirt nap.
homer, our house is on fire! help me save the children!
i don't know what to do.
well, what do you know about being a mob boss?
this guy in here owes us money.
look mister, i-i-i don't got the cash. my clientele -- they're all bums. they never pay!
homer, the mob is puttin' the screws on me, see. i ain't gettin' killed 'cause you won't pay your tab. now give me fifty bucks!
look, all-all-all i got is twenty-five. i swear! i swear!
homer, where did you get that truck?
homer, helen lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. could you pick it up?
dad, you want i should plug him in the ankle?
bart... mr. simpson. we are getting out of the mob business, right now.
i'm sorry. i just can't live with myself, seeing you this way.
i'm afraid not.
and i can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.
someone poisoned these meatballs. homer...?
class all the way.
oh dear. dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
he's just drumming louder!
is it in a safe neighborhood? just make it happen!
i thought you wanted me to drum!
i was jamming with skinny turner and marbles le marquez! and they want me to join their trio!
bart, a rising star like you needs a manager, and gil's your guy! oh, i'm a jazz daddy from way back...with the skit-skat skittily boom-de-boom, and the ding-dong daddy... is that jazz? that's jazz, right? cha-cha-cha with the curly fries!
okay, guys. no one knows you're here, so be quiet. and if you get hungry, there are rats living in the christmas decorations.
i feel so terrible. i just wanted to save those animals while bart became a drummer... but i never thought the two stories would intersect.
i guess that's it. these animals are all gonna die.
do you have an idea?
how you doing, bro? we've got the latest by nabil -- "uma shang shang -- the flower song!" uma shang shang / uma shang shang / uma shang shang. is like eh, bruce springsteen the boss. ya?
if you buy now, i give you tooth ache cream. tooth ache cream.
uh, that candy's been here an awfully long time. i'd think twice if i were you.
you are not bringing that thing home.
well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse.
"wisconsin from above," "veterans' day parades," ooh, "smiles of ireland"! redheaded twins? their mother must have her hands full!
well, i like the idea of you as a handyman... and i love the idea of you reading!
homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?
don't you have any follow-through on anything?
it's so unfair -- i'm as handy as any man.
i guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing. homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!
superlative! please install a doggie door sized for a teacup poodle.
i'm terribly sorry. i thought i heard the sound of a woman measuring.
yes, but you're holding your hammer backwards.
a dash of glue, a turn of screw, and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two -- or more! uh-oh, switch!
mm-hmm! simpson, you're a master craftsman.
why did my hypothetical scenario scare you so?
this is shirley. yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. goodbye!
homie... i think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. i mean, look at your t-shirt!
why does lenny need a windmill anyway?
and to think you built this whole thing with your own two hands.
homer, it's time people knew the truth: i'm doing the work and i want the credit.
mr. simpson, shouldn't we begin by securing the struts?
so what? he's paying us fifty grand.
let's go home.
dad, here's a thought: if you just gave mom credit, maybe she could help you.
i'd like a daddy who lived in the real world.
your father's finally gonna get exposed as the credit-stealing fraud he is! perfect.
ooooooooooooooooooooh!
dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!
oh my god, he'll kill himself! he'll never hear me say "i told you so!"
homer, i was pretty upset with you, but in the end, i... i... i-beam!
look! a shooting star!
that almost tore my head off!
dad, no! it could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!
how could you eat that goo? you don't know what galaxy it's from!
dad?
homer! you won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?
is that the cat?
the flames are sealing in my juices!
tell my friends i died kissing a girl!
what did we germans ever do to deserve this? oh, right.
i like big guts and i cannot lie / double chins with the chafing thighs / when a dude walks in with the hanging jowls, and my stomach starts to growl / i'm gettin' hungry / so i masticate / chomping on the overweight / i eat fat people for days / like potato chips by lay's / try to eat just one, but it can't be done / i've got to eat a ton / baby likes fat / baby likes fat
homer, i need to talk to you.
you've got a weight problem, and you know it.
aren't you?
homer, your family's here. and you gotta help me help them help you help me help you.
i have to be honest with you -- i can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.
dad, you're eating dr. phil!
food does not equal love!
it worked! now, there's something i've wanted to do for a long time. can't you read my writing? i didn't say kick homer's "walls".
the cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
just write a scroll, asking him to stop.
we interrupt this dance music from the meridian room in capitol city's fabulous hotel hitler, to bring you a special bulletin.
astronomers say the ominous capsules originated from earth's closest neighbor...
mars!
you know, homer, we haven't actually seen these aliens.
dad! a flying saucer blew up that statue!
what?! homer! our son joined the army!
okay mr. simpson, we'll tear up your son's contract.
sounds uh, like you're kind of tired of being bossed around at home.
would you be interested in, um... i don't know, joining the army?
hey, a big target like you will be home a lot sooner than that.
we have this issue of parade magazine.
homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home.
at-ten-tion! ordinarily i would spend the next two hours questioning your sexuality, running down your hometowns, and telling you to drop and give me various numbers.
here's your nicknames: brooklyn, hollywood, kissimmee-st. cloud florida, maverick, blanket hog, newman's own, master of suspense, england's rose, nickname pending, bram stoker's dracula, and snowflake...
a troublemaker, huh? you're gonna sit here and eat donuts, while the rest of the unit does push-ups.
okay, listen up!
well, thank you.
frontline infantry!
gentlemen, i'll be frank. never before has the army accepted recruits with test scores as low as yours.
i'm not handing out medals. but i am gonna give you a special assignment. the army is conducting war games and we want you to play the enemy.
so they're not shipping you overseas?
stay crunchy in milk!
oh. guess i'd better do my part.
that's how it works? i was just drawin' wangs on the numbers.
the salvation army? you got it.
okay.
hey! they's usin' live ammo!
that was our last christmas card.
i'd give anything to hear homer's voice.
it's not giant and it's not in the distance! it's small and it's in our room!
hustle your bustles, gang! we're going to the senior olympics to root for grampa!
i wonder if the dog thought about us while we were gone.
homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives.
dear pus bag...
thanks. so here's my digs.
moe, these fragments are fascinating. "i was in the christmas pageant once. mom showed up with a new boyfriend. he called me steve." what you've got here is poetry!
thanks, homer. i love ya, man.
i don't care about my grade. i'm gonna send moe's poem to "american poetry perspectives."
homer, don't drink and drive!
lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! we're going vermonting!
you guys go ahead. i don't think i'd be very good company...
that was my house, you moron!
lisa, if you could just forgive me, you would make me the happiest man in vermont. except for those two dudes i saw gettin' hitched. not my thing, but i wish 'em well.
homer, would it make you feel better if any of that hit me?
so what? that's legal in rolo-polo!
oh, in that case...
if you want to keep your job, then you better start... ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba... you're thinking about that ice cream truck, aren't you? well, you can just forget about... come and lick me, big boy! i said lick me!
homer, there you are! what does my best customer want today?
i wish i had more customers like you. i'm barely scraping by.
...ninety-nine-fifty... ninety-nine-seventy-five...
you must be homer.
oh, yes! max loved to talk about his work. how he bored me. and now i'm left with nothing but my lover and this worthless truck.
you'll buy max's truck?
how can we forget? mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
otto, you totally pimped dad's ride!
eh, what the hell.
i'm a unitard!
i do, but i'm lactose-intolerant.
but my doctor says that i...
call the number on my bracelet.
i'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.
that's right, tell me all your little wooden dreams. you're not alone any more. no you ain't. aw, you're shivering, are you cold? where you goin', marge?
homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. i'm as hopeful and full of life as i was in the years before i met you.
well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
hey, i do more than tv. i had a one-man show on broadway. that's who showed up -- one man! long story short, i won a drama desk award.
you can't go to work! i need you here for emotional support -- plus you make a small crowd look huge!
the show starts at three. you promise you'll be here?
hey, give me one of everything! hey!
already? it's only thirty-eight seconds to three.
see, statements like that are why people think we're gay.
well, homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. good job. very thorough.
oh, stop. just stop. you don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!
mom! mom!
there's mom!
homer, i wanna show the world how i feel about you.
they will be! ready, bullies? homer, you wanted a sign that i still love you, so here it is.
now i know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
you're the worst husband in the world!
don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle. dear lord, thank you for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy.
dad, don't make me go! i'll give you a back rub!
why?
look at our kids! playin' like champs!
homie... when you're done putting lisa to bed we can, uh, finish what we started the other day.
dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?
angelica button and the dragon king's trundle bed. it's the ninth book in the "angelica button" series.
oh dad, i'm tired. we'll read more tomorrow.
no! we have to read it together.
you must read ahead. fiction is your passion!
just read the book, you shaved ape.
just take a peek at the title of the next chapter and see if you can resist.
greystash.
c'mon dad, read the last chapter! everyone says there's a big surprise -- i bet angelica discovers that she's a wizard!
come on, read, read!
why are you stopping? we're almost at the happy ending!
and now, to go on living! 
is that really how it ends? what happened to the merlinical council?
dad, you can read to me anytime.
gee, you're really upset about this greystash thing.
homer, it's just a book.
awwww!
grumply, grumply groo, i'll throw my net over you!
come on, homer, let's get the kids out of here. homer?
yeah! maybe i should spend the night here, too.
but i haven't given you a present.
well, i figured since you invited me to stay, i might as well go down to the bus locker and get my stuff.
grumply, grumply groo, your blood will make my stew!
i'll tell you why: christian charity.
i promise you, he'll leave after today.
i will.
well, i got something...a spider bite. or as i like to call it, a "christmas kiss."
wait, you don't have a place to live?
i guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
he's still in need, we have to let him stay. it's what dr. king would want us to do.
please, just a few more days.
and that's why i have trouble saying "no" to people -- even gil!
what'sa matter, homer? do you still miss the upn?
well, you can't kick him out, 'cause then marge will never learn to assert herself.
homie, wake up! i rented that negligee you like.
homer, don't forget it's valentine's day! whatcha gettin' the mrs.?
aw geez... boy, i was... well, i'm still a winner. as long as i've got a cup-a coffee and a tomorrow on the calendar, ol' gil's comin' back. say homer, how 'bout closin' up that robe? i'm seeing the whole butcher shop.
mccarthy pumps the old bassoon while i the pipes do play / and henessee tennessee tootles the flute and the music is somethin' grand... a credit to old ireland/ is macnamara's band.
i'll tell you what. we're going to scottsdale!
sure!
there he is! 
whoa, gil's a big shot!
i don't care how successful gil is, he's still a mooch, and i need to tell him off!
ooh, this is one of our trips to barnacle bay! we used to rent a beach house there every summer. i was so happy on that island...
this was my favorite seahorse. i called him mr. funnygoodfeeling... oh god, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!
dip your berries? / powder your jellies?
i make it nice and sticky, heh?
homer, that's too much sugar!
excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. what happened?
no, no, it was long before him.
i guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember.
homer, this is wonderful. where are the kids?
can i go again?
aaahhh!
well, at least they left your underwear on. that was nice of them.
i say let him fish it off. these waters are so barren, by the time he pays the debt, he'll be as old and as queer as i am!
none. just a few slarg fish.
no, you don't eat it. its oil is used to polish stripper poles.
wait, this is bait! homer, i told you to beer batter the shrimp and bait the hooks. did you do the opposite?
it's not opposite day!
it's not opposite day! the yum-yum fish! they're back! we're gonna be rich! and it's all thanks to you, homer! or should i say... chief fish clubber homer!
oh homie, i'm so worried. but if i concentrate, our love is so strong, i know i can hear your thoughts.
dad... i couldn't stay with mom and lisa while you were out here.
they were gonna go to the folk art museum, then they were gonna paint crab shells. not crush them, paint them.
we're still gonna make it, aren't we dad?
absolutely. bart, the sea wouldn't dare take the life of an apple-cheeked young lad like yourself.
not yet.
in about two seconds.
we'll never know how that brave crew spent their final moments. maybe a boiler blew up, sheared their faces clean off. all we do know is they're in heaven now, hanging their lines off a cloud, and fishin' for airplanes.
how did you make it?
welcome, homer, to our watery realm.
you're not!
lot of garbage fish today.
chill thunder! "chill thunder"!
outta my way, ya seatbelt wearin' cowards!
homer, no! revenge never solves anything.
papa, may we have petit fours?
you're under arrest for treason!
tell it to le baton!
i sentence you to life...
hey wait, did you guys hear that? he just admitted it! guys? oh man, this place is so unfair.
now get some sleep -- you've got a nine a.m. rat helmet.
you're the traitor.
perhaps i may be of help.
i'm your cellmate. you never noticed me, because, frankly, you're extremely self-centered.
young man, i have the answer to your problems. i spent thirty years digging this tunnel, but now i can't use it. i'm simply too old.
but you can escape -- and use this map to retrieve my buried treasure. with it, you can have your revenge!
well, because before my wretched life comes to a close, i want to know that i had one friend. also, because while you slept, i violated you repeatedly.
when we meet the count, do you think he'll like us? / i've heard rumors he's mysterious!
i've heard about these things. they're good for doin' the wife, right?
ma?...
homer, you're back!
homer...
papa meaux! papa meaux!
we were together for five years! now who's gonna take care of the triplets?
for me, huh? what took you so long?
weren't you listening? i just told you a whole story about revenge.
dad, wait, i've got a story about why revenge is wrong.
the point, dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm.
look at that view. it reminds me how insignificant we are in the world. yee haw!
dad, wait! you haven't heard my story.
you should feel lucky. not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night.
hand over your wallet!
shut up!
so you see, revenge is great. and there's three ways to talk about it. although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a halloween story...
yeah. it turns out we have a lot in common. we're both from connecticut! look at all them stars. how many do you think there are?
what the?! two?! you think there are two?! well, i never, how could-- why do you think it is that mankind is so inclined towards hatin' one another?
tomorrow's multicultural day at school.
aw, grampa. we should take lots of pictures of him while we still can.
homer, is that you?!
and that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? they had seven names for that.
uh, thank you and goodnight. show's over, let's go!
well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked.
hey, guys. i'll see you in a bit. i entered a thousand mile baja road race.
hello?
oh, man! what now?
this sucks! i can't do anything fun, 'cause i'm doing so many stupid errands! shut up, shut up, shut up!
i'm bart simpson, who the hell are you? oh, right. darcy.
what? not you, fibbing bear!
i just found this note in bart's room! "dear mom and dad: me and my girlfriend darcy have gone to utah to get married. f.y.i., she's pregnant"!
i did!
okay, we can trace where the kids are by the charges they made on your card. in colorado, they charged two hundred dollars worth of bubble gum.
"dingle's berries" in provo, utah?
our daughter says she's run off with your son!
no!
you know, i thought darcy and i would be like a real married couple. instead we just ended up fighting all the time.
you know, for a while, i was kinda looking forward to bein' a dad.
aww. and someday you'll be one too.
homer is so amazing! he can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.
i can't believe it. homer simpson... a bloody millionaire!
wheee! /
can i use it on fish and chips?
what are you people doing in my summer home?
i am an angry rich man!
oh fah-ther, my pony buttercup can jump ever so high-- hoo-boy, it's mr. burns.
then i just want to know why your husband did what he did.
i have some footage to show you.
at bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. and you know what? no monsters have gotten me yet.
homer! don't kill the foreign man!
i overslept! the family can't start the day without me!
homie, you woke up early?
why do i have to go to a stupid psychiatrist? i told a scary story, big deal.
and... my dad never takes me on the merry-go-booger. he's always passed out in the parking snot.
dad, those kids aren't dumb. this show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!
this basement is a wonderful gift to the family. but how could you afford it?
mr. simpson, do you understand how bankruptcy works?
under the new law, you have to pay your creditors everything.
mr. simpson, among the expenses the court deems frivolous: you throw over one thousand dollars a month into local wishing wells.
uh-huh. well you're going to have to make some serious cutbacks to your expenses. three subscriptions to "vanity fair?"
shut up! it's an instructional website! shut up!
i don't wanna leave! you promised me i could die here!
grampa's driving me crazy!
can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
for some reason, she doesn't trust him. maybe it's the bang-up job he did raising you.
all right, lips, man your kissing stations! this is not a drill!
i'm selma.
yeah, i know who i was kissing, and i also know why! i'm a little shaky on when and where, but i got my theories!
ah, the hell with you. i just might ask that selma girl out. and you can't tell me not to! my roof, my rules!
be nice, homer. don't you see how great it is that they found each other? like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog.
well gee, homer, you uh, ain't exactly open-casket material yourself.
it's me -- patty.
look, if you wanna break up your father and selma, i have a plan. but it involves you.
hello, homer.
relax, it's just me, patty. do you have your disguise?
what the hell is going on here?
homer! why would you try to break us up?
well, nerts to both of ya! our love is so strong, not even a thousand crazy schemes could tear it apart!
homer, say hello to your new maw! 
dad, don't throw rice, it makes the birds swell up!
oh, i don't know, he might come home any minute.
i don't think we're doing this right.
happy birthday dear homer / happy birthday to you!
no, dad, they're the opposite.
it's okay, homie. you're probably just tired from not doing anything all day.
you could buy a fireproof safe.
sir, we've been here six times this month.
okay, everyone gets to put one precious item in our fireproof safe. for me, it's the family photo album.
it's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. so i made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation.
i picked my malibu stacy hybrid convertible. it runs on her old makeup and out-of-style shoes.
oh man. i thought i was strong enough to get through this again -- but i'm not.
bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
this is a celebrity scandal! we could sell that photo to a tabloid. and they pay big money for photos.
this is good. real good! like lindsay lohan looking drunk, high and bony. click, click, career over, see ya in the gutter, freckles. homer, i'll pay ya two hundred bucks. bring me more snaps like this, and i'll make you a moderately wealthy man!
wheeee -- i'm sort of rich! i can rent anything i want!
sure, why not?
your head dinged my door panel. jerks like you oughtta be shot!
paparazzi?! get lost, ya parasite!
ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
c'mon, baby -- barf for mama.
hello, homer. have you lost weight?
tell me, how's maggie?
i was talking about your baby.
dad! it's drederick tatum. try to get him to punch you.
yes, how can i help you, my handsome friend?
okay, here we go. that's what i think of the fourth estate!
nobility, clergy and commoners. learn your french history!
terrific. outstanding! this has page one written all over it. what the hell did you do that for?
it's eleven at night and i can't get to sleep!
okay. 
well, i do like the extra money. but i think maybe you should stop exploiting human beings' private misfortunes.
okay, this is the place.
no! should i attach it for you?
do you, rainier luftwaffe wolfcastle, take maria shriver-kennedy-quimby to be your lawful wedded--
smile!
sweetie, maybe it's time you retired from paparazzing. it's never fun to get a taste of your own medicine.
and my sister once saw burt reynolds at an airport, and he wouldn't even co-sign her mortgage.
uh here, use this one. i was gonna use it to take secret photos in the ladies' turlet. but no dames ever come in this joint!
celebrities: hide your shame! what are you going to do with those photos?
moving on, our class trip to italy is now spaghetti night at papa john's, and your fifteen-hundred dollar deposits will not be refunded.
sunny? i never have to look out the window again! paper towels for sixty-nine cents... sixty-eight cents... sixty-six cents! kids, get in the car! we're going to pennsylvania! six hundred twenty-nine thousand results. wow! and all this time i thought "googling yourself" meant the other thing. it's our house! but what's that thing? everyone can see you! get inside!
just put on a towel!
homer, you've met my parents.
you already promised you would.
he quit! being a ref is a thankless job... the parents hate ya... the only upside is the kids share their snack with you.
dad, where'd you get that outfit?
that was my father!
you don't even know the rules! this could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!
dad, i'm impressed! you've become a much better referee.
i'm a spectator addressing a player, answer me!
helen, please. don't drop the "j" bomb.
ow! she tripped me. ow! owww!
that is an outrage! your daughter's been floppin' all day!
how about a lecture from me -- ronaldo?
you heard geraldo. what's it gonna be?
you can't give me a yellow card?! you're my father!
this is what i think of your yellow card!
it was just a game. a game i used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
big if!
wanna go slam a few beers?
what'sa matter, homer and bart?
gee moe, you give great advice.
not interested.
no.
you were right to kick me out of that game. soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of europe and south america.
so from now on i'll play soccer for the same reason i study chemistry -- for fun! do you want to play a little?
i hogged it! i hogged it!
not at all!
unless you're serving me a cold beer, you keep moving.
uh-uh. my wife's lookin' for a bathing suit that doesn't make her look "horsey". so, i'm gonna be here a while.
wow, this is soft...
what in the name of-- hey, you!
are you sleeping in the middle of my department store?
that's the best endorsement i've heard since mickey mantle for maypo! i'll take five mattresses.
you do now, son! you're hired!
all this fuss for a baseball game? why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?
i put on fresh makeup for this?
aw, hey that's the guy what created him! if homer had used some protection, we'd all be poopin' roses on easy street!
was there even a baseball game yesterday? i don't remember!
don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?
yes, i need to be able to sleep through my wife's nagging, and my eight horrible babies and the anguished howls of my ancestors.
homer, we have a friend -- actually, a friend of a friend--
homer, please! they can hear you in fine china!
oooh, sold!
we're here about the mattress.
we tried raising cain but we weren't able.
i know the mechanics of lovemaking, homer! you owe us a refund!
if you let us have your mattress, we'll give you ours.
well, maybe if you go...
i'm sorry, homie -- i want to snuggle, but i'm just not feeling it.
you traded our mattress? i had my secret cash in it!
every day, every day, every day, yay, yay... yay!
i'm starting to feel funny about doing this.
homer, stop that.
how dare you break into our house, defile our bed, and smash our family photos with your foot.
well, i am reminded of the story of wise king solomon.
i wish he hadn't cut it that way -- it looks like a grilled-cheese sandwich.
you really wanna make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?
where's your father with those pacifiers?
larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt? larry flynt?
are you counting sheep all night long?
homer, i think you dominoed this.
it was you.
i've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken ambien -- i mean nappien. see? "may cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."
mr. simpson, why did you hurt the dollies?
but users are losers.
why don't you just quit taking the pills, you hophead?
why am i sleeping when right next door is every boy's dream: a fat, suggestible zombie dad. hey zombie -- wanna come out and play?
no, play!
and that's only one of the cool things we're gonna do with him...
c'mon, just one more.
you've horribly injured the whole fire department!
that's just someone barbecuing.
sweetheart, come to dinner.
that's the fire siren!
just come back alive, okay?
hey, this is sweet, huh? almost makes up for not gettin' paid.
of all the nerve.
oooh, leather arms! people just give you this stuff?
no, no, no, the complete "munsters" on dvd!
i can't believe he acted completely in character.
gentlemen, i'd like to thank you. you've saved my store.
uh, well, your building will be fine, but unfortunately a lot of your merchandise was completely vaporized: high-end stereo equipment, size ten men's shoes...
oh my, i didn't think the damage was that bad. but you must be telling the truth -- you're firemen, after all.
uh, gentlemen... i'm uh... i'm starting to wonder if we've crossed a line here.
just let the chemicals deal with it.
well, uh...
you're nothing but a diabolical master thief. the kind that haunts the slopes of san moritz or the casinos of monte carlo.
you should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. kids, get in here and show your father the faces!
are you crazy? it's five hundred degrees in here! oh no, wait, it's only four ninety-five. what's on your mind?
what'd you do with all the loot?
this winning cornucopia is magnificent. styrofoam?
ooh, look! pine-cone first ladies!
dad, look, a corn maze!
maybe we should split up.
no, no, i didn't mean--
i was talking about--
i just meant we should split up to get out of this corn maze.
now there must be a way out!
that was never my plan.
eat some corn!
this maze is too hard for me.
santa's little helper would be an awesome police dog! can he, dad? can he?
please, can he?
i can't believe it. my own dog bit me.
homer!
i don't want a new dog. i want my old dog, the one who bit me.
oh, no problem, pally -- our pythons cost five dollars a foot.
that's because i soaked him in slime!
homer, can you breathe?!
whoa, this is the source of the stench!
vile curd! simpson, you can take your putrid mess far out of my sight, you songless land-whale!
what about the fat guy?
i'm bulking up for football.
okay, this might hurt a little. no problem. oh, sweet mother of mary!
well, the school's having a bake sale.
so true.
raisin cake! who wants raisin cake? don't worry, it's not too moist!
i gave you ten dollars.
well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
yes there is!
dad, that's a bomb!
oh, my special little guy. i'm so glad you're okay.
yeah, dad.
make room for jumbo.
nothing.
praise the lord.
yeah, bart.
bart's makin' faces, dad.
oh bart, you fall for that every six months.
you're going to the dentist too, dad.
mr. simpson, have you been flossing regularly?
well let's just get started.
i haven't started yet.
don't worry, sweetie -- i'm sure that man has some special tooth problem.
this film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. mixed signals, hmm.
dad, that's ludicrous!
don't you love that clean-mouth feeling?
i can't wait to get the freshness out of my mouth!
it's a sundae that's fun.
cup or cone?
congratulations! you just purchased the one millionth ice-cream cone sold by this store!
dad!
tonight on smartline, a provocative discussion of the middle east... will not be featured. instead, we'll be talking to a man who bought an ice-cream cone.
of course that has nothing to do with the fact that this station and the ice-cream company are owned by the same corporation... but i digress. all right, let's just get through this. uh, mr. simpson, tell us how it felt when you bought the fateful treat.
no one saw my show... so no one heard my filthy faux pas! my career is safe!
uh... hey look, it's the airport bus. you should get on it.
okay, "smallville"... super dog licks himself. that definitely goes in the naughty pile! sixty minutes -- morley safer has questionable pants fold -- "the l word" -- used the "l" word. and now to peruse the local news!
that's because you're sitting on me, you lummox!
i invited him to stay with us for a few days. his career is ruined, and i was afraid he might commit you-know-what-icide.
you'll have to excuse him -- he's been watching a lot of fox news.
we have to take in mr. brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
and you're constantly flouting the law.
this is fox news with the latest liberal outrage. it seems liberals want to give nasa the right to "abort" space missions whenever they feel like it.
one thing i've always wondered: how can fox news be so conservative, when the fox network keeps airing raunchy shows? they don't fit together.
liberals hate families...
and swear like a lumberjack who hacked off a leg. let's do it!
i guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
of course. gosh, dad, your hands are shaking!
...entertaining america with hits like "house," "american idol" and "american idol results show."
i guess this is the end. i just wish i'd spent more time at the office.
...me!
i'll pick you up at five tomorrow. and i'll pick you up right now. got it!
hey dad, have fun with your boyfriend.
so simpson, i hear you like pizza pie.
chicago, eh? well what if i took us there now?
and just so you know, she'll do anything for you. anything except sex. and i do mean anything.
now, why don't you listen to the musical stylings of mr. lionel richie.
sure, i guess. hey you, beer me / beer me for always, that's the way it should be / hey you, beer me / beer us together, naturally
we'll be back before you know it.
nice job -- where do i apply? now i need a location.
i heard "a starbucks... in siberia!" finally, an emotion.
while you were here, we felt like new york!
homer, you smell like chicago. did you fly there on a commercial airline?
wow. is it much different from a normal plane?
homie, what's wrong?
hi, dad.
that's where you're wrong, homer.
this is colby krause. i hired him to help you improve your life. he'll get you back on a private plane in no time!
i'm a life coach.
the first step in self-improvement is to take a thorough look at your life.
is uncle fester still alive?
no. okay, now i just want you to do what you normally do.
homer, before you even head out the door in the morning, you're already a loser.
homer, your journey downstairs would've been a lot safer if you'd remembered the n.d.c.'s of concentration: never don't concentrate.
homer, you're up!
homer, here in the bowling alley, you're a totally different man: relaxed, confident...
i want you to wear those bowling shoes out the door and everywhere you go. it's crazy, but it just might work.
that's not my name.
homer, your shoe attitude is bowling people over. these are letters from companies interested in interviewing you!
this one.
they need a safety inspector to fly between their north american plants.
you here for the safety inspector job?
we're all so proud of you, sweetie.
well, with a coffee you can stay till lunch. then you have to order a solid.
they're all the same maze.
so, how was your first day at your new job?
i'm so proud of you, dad!
why aren't you at your new job?
you sure know how to repeat the joke i just told ya. but as a formality i must ask: do you know anything about copper tubing?
no.
leave your resume with cheryl!
security! security!
but dad, you've gotta tell her. she's been buying brand-name groceries.
hello?
it's bad news, isn't it? i should never get my hopes up. nothing ever works out for us.
really?
well, anything for a fellow marine.
uh, did you just say "semper fudge"?
look at this business center -- fax, wi-fi, teleconferencing capabilities... i'm gonna remember this day for the rest of my life!
sweetheart, what do you mean?
what was that?
homie, what are you doing? you don't know how to fly!
all right, homer. what is it you're attempting to do? win over a difficult client?
homer, i've gotta tell you, i'm not very good. i went to the harvard of the south.
not duke.
okay, homer. i don't know anything about planes, but i know about you. you have what made america great: no understanding of the limits of your power, and a complete lack of concern for what anyone thinks of you. so you'll land that plane. and do you know why? because i heard some guy say you couldn't.
homer, you did it! you landed a jet!
and at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
this concludes our service. go now in the peace of the lord.
we left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!
dad, all you circled were the "i's" and "a's".
well, where should we go for brunch? griddler on the roof? thank god it's fried eggs? luftwaffle's? bodacious frittatas? buffet the hunger slayer?
be my guest.
every place has such a long line.
there's a place -- with no line!
bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house.
hi... you!
oh homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus.
it must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
um, listen, i'm outta town next week, so...
excuse me. my brother twisted his ankle setting up the chairs.
would you like to be a pallbearer?
please sir, a little respect for the dead.
well, time to move on with our lives.
homer, you have a mild back sprain. and you also ingested a dangerous quantity of grave dirt.
not dirt -- vegetables!
you know, homer, your singing could help alleviate patient suffering, and save us a fortune in demerol.
well, young people are my future.
excellent, excellent! the springfield opera house, of which i am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing la bohème. i want you to sing the lead.
places, everyone!
for the last time, it's not a movie!
rodolfo, perchè siete che vi trovate giù?
yeah. but these seats are terrible.
my boy, you are a star!
and you contributed to our culture!
no, no. it's a good thing.
the dance isn't till next week.
nice set, homer. that was a hot one.
call me p-dingo.
you know, homer, there's one thing about opera that has always bugged me: everyone sings instead of talking. but you made me believe i was in a magical world where singing is talking.
wait, homer, before you go, there's this new note i'm working on. tell me what you think...
like this...?
you know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage.
excuse us... would you mind signing autographs for my mother and me?
what is he saying?
ay chi-what?
i want you to stop flirting with women.
sir, may i say i thoroughly enjoyed your performance.
want us to take marge shopping?
we're trapped. your fans will rip us to pieces.
that's right, i'm a woman!
that's a great idea! to celebrate, i'll go whip us up some chex mix pie.
now listen, homer. you can have me any time you want me.
what is it, sweetie?
she's perfect! for the first time since you became an opera star i can finally relax.
all right, homer. i understand perfectly. you shall never be mine.
yes?
dad, i think someone's trying to kill you!
why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?
let's go, hagliacci -- or should i say, madame butterface! what? what? i had two.
goodnight, maggie. come on, sweetie. everyone's going to sleep.
shout!
shout!
hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
a little bit louder now!
maggie's so clingy! homer, hold her while i pour the milk!
i sold it all to teenagers. there is a rumor you can mix milk, mentos and lotto scrapings to make jetpack fuel.
it's either milk... or paint.
you want milk? i got yer milk right here!
listen up, ya humps! which one of yaz parked at the bank? 'cause they're towin' yer sorry ass.
i'll tell you what. i'll give you a ride to the impound lot.
my boss? i don't think my boss has a problem with anything i do.
well, he's in this truck right now.
no, ya dumb dominic. i'm my own boss.
i don't call in sick -- i work when i want to.
...and lasso the street cattle.
the cars i tow. i got all kinds a names for 'em: she-atas, hebrew canoes, spam cans, swedish speedballs, and of course, stretch lame-os.
my blow better still be in the glove box.
you know... if you're interested... we could use another hook jockey. the springfield territory's wide open, since flatbed fred got killed in that murder-murder-murder-suicide.
for five hundred bucks, i'll sell ya this old bucket.
not to worry. these are the ones you show at home.
no problem.
now just remember two rules... one, stick to springfield. if i catch you on my turf, i'll rip off your head, vomit down your neck, pull out your heart, show it to your head, then shove 'em both down your neck hole, to which i previously alluded.
rule two, always keep your hook pointed out.
stop! stop! i'm entitled to park there.
what the hell are you doing?!
huh?
with those jerks out of the way, i was able to park right outside!
maggie, what can i get you for breakfas-- oh. you did everything yourself. homer, where have you been?
i don't want to live like that.
well, no one's disputing that.
top of the mornin', tow-mer!
so it is! i'm just here to pay the fine for the sunday school bus. you towed it with the kids still in it!
you know what they say: "with great power comes great responsibility."
i told you to stay off my turf!
goodbye.
we're just like you -- tow truck drivers who got greedy.
the truth is, we're just waiting for each others' hair to grow so we can braid it.
dad? where are you?
working? where?
you sound weird.
oh, that's great. / great story...
homie! you're all right!
well, i have to look good for tomorrow.
you have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.
homer, you cannot miss lisa's big day. and you have to come sober!
point zero eight sober.
point zero nine.
deal.
and now the reason we're all here today... lisa simpson!
homer! i'm a hostage in a bank robbery.
don't worry about me. i was voted america's least funny clown. worse than scuzzo, scummo, oopsie, carlos mencia, stinko, blumpy... even worse than sergeant serious! how could i do worse than him?! i stole all his jokes!
i just want to go home.
you're disgracing america's pastime. you should be ashamed of yourself... what the...?
you said you visited him every night.
dwight, that was the most unselfish thing i've ever seen. i'm sorry i didn't visit you before.
you see, the problem is, we've grown apart.
greetings, two forty-one.
i want you to eliminate this reporter: kent brockman. he found the gully where i dump electricity every summer to jack up prices.
well i won't be home either. i'm, uh... flipping over wheelbarrows in case it rains.
ninth floor -- assassin's perch.
you just can't get russian gangster blood out. must be something they eat.
uh... a blender cozy. how was your night?
homie, i made you my "killer" lasagna.
you're a killer for hire!
how could you not tell me you were an assassin?
i told you twenty times! you never listen!
listen, i...
i get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?
all those nights i thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!
stop it! that's my favorite couch!
it sounded like you were.
great. now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will "super dad" be then?
we got a complaint from an anonymous "neighboreeno" about an elaborately-choreographed high-octane ultra-fight. i would have taken a bribe!
i'd like to see you do a guy sometime.
we'll be killing every human in two days / we'll be killing every human in two days / we will cook them / we will eat them / 'cause that's the way to treat them...
kodos the destroyer!
open this door at once!
we know it's you, mr. simpson. now where's the alien?
bart... friend?
definitely -- especially if you count the inside flap as part of the cover. it usually gives you a great idea of what the book's about.
actually, i'm still alive, so technically it's vivisection.
excuse me, but this is not good!
perhaps i can be of some assistance. i've got something that will scare the h-e-double sippy straws out of them.
sloth!
there's a bee on maggie!
cool.
homer! the wedding's in twenty minutes! just pick a tie!
why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
you don't know what color my eyes are?
no peeking. i'm wai-ting.
you really don't know, do you?
no.
little help?
but why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?
and until they do, you can stay here.
stop naming things!
then go to moe's!
thanks, mags. i could use a pick-me-up. oh my god. i've become the world's oldest baby. men don't get their moo-moo from a ba-ba! they get their moo-moo from a big-boy cup! i can't be a baby anymore. i'm alone now. i have to be a man! thanks, mags.
oh my god, look at these poll numbers. aye carumba! oh man. milhouse has gone from being a comic figure to a tragic one. if he could go back to being happy, i could go back to being cool.
well, well, look who's strollin' down alzheimer avenue. you used to know everything about that wife of yours. even wrote a song about her.
oh homie, i'd forgotten that beautiful song you wrote for me.
all right, i get it. you're cool, you're not "mainstream," you wear a porkpie hat...
"rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame".
we have a family.
yep, nothing beats living on "wife-support".
my wife invented "skypills." she uh, mixed vitamins with alka-seltzer and pretended it was medicine.
that's why i drive a bentley.
and they're not talking about cars.
as soon as our wives hit it big, they dumped the fat old guys they were with and married us. yes!
here's how you know she's really about to go: your wife seems happy and full of life.
oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day.
well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed mount everest and got everyone else killed.
that's okay. i don't care that you don't care. go watch your thing.
really? but i'm so used to my old one.
what's gotten into you? i'm going to the successful ladies room!
homer, i'm gonna let you in on a secret. i'm a first husband. i used to look like this.
oh, there's no secret. just hard work...
...exercise two hours a day...
...keep up with the latest fashions...
...and of course, cut out all fatty foods and alcohol.
mr. simpson, let me outline the gastric bypass surgery procedure for you. okay? we put a band around your stomach so that no solid food may enter. you see? just like so... it's a very, very serious operation. you should only undergo it as a last resort.
very well. if you wish, we can perform the procedure in the office, today.
dad, are you okay? i see food on your plate instead of blurring motions.
you had your hot dog plumped?
homie, i'm back!
you remembered i like romance!
you also remembered i like flattery!
homie, you look good!
let me get a good look at you!
what are you hiding from me? is it chocolate?
whoa! those buns are poppin' fresh!
and i'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
you want me to unstaple your stomach?
and so, to honor her success, i bestow upon marge simpson this hundred dollar gift card to sweatpants etcetera.
listen, homer, i gotta be honest with you...
okay.
the doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. and i said no. but i did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man i love.
and dad, i hope you learned something from this.
well, maybe i could. but every time i look at you, i see the same adorable boy i fell in love with.
interested in a car stereo?
big special on camcorders!
care to make love, sir?
that'll be fifty cents -- or free, with the purchase of a $200 tivo plus a two-year contract.
sir, your tivo?
oh no we won't! 
oh tivo remote, you've changed my life. i've gotten so much accomplished: i saved "lost", watched all of "rome" in a day, and got through "two and a half men" in two and a half minutes. then i ran out of space and had to choose between "sophie's choice" and "schindler's list."
howdy, folks! are you tired of family arguments over where to go to dinner?
why not try wes doobner's world famous family style rib huts! the rib joint with something for everyone.
we've got ribs...
we're going to a rest'rant grand op'niiiiiiiing... / but don't fill up on bread!
there aren't any tables or chairs.
i see no grill, oven, or food of any kind.
hello, simpsons.
and now you're all going to die -- just because you watched a television commercial!
before you die, perhaps you'd like to know how i engineered my ultimate revenge.
i'm wes doobner.
shut up! this time, to liven up my tale, i brought along some visual aides. just call me... slideshow bob!
"the hills have eyes three: the hills still have eyes". and now, the moment we've all been waiting for...
he mocked my folksy ways!
well, i guess the rest of us should pay our respects.
feet? killing?! we gotta save bart!
bob planned this from the beginning --
he wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
he would never get a shakespeare quote wrong --
his mother was a shakespearean actress!
his father is a doctor...
...so when bob collapsed in the courtroom...
...his father could take that opportunity to inject bob with a powerful drug that simulated death.
it was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!
stop that cremation!
you're too late, simpsons!
get me outta here. what are you doing? i can't breathe!
well, this time i think sideshow bob is finally locked up for good.
was you ever. you came in sayin' you really needed to forget something, so i mixed you up the most powerful drink i got... the "forget-me-shot."
that means it worked. no one ever remembers. that's why i made this video to explain the process. you start with a splash of jaegermeister, then add sloe gin, triple-sec, quadruple-sec, gunk from a dog's eye, absolut pickle...
you don't remember, huh? there was a domestic disturbance at your address yesterday.
why don't you ask the person who filed the complaint? not that i am authorized to release that infor--
fine, it was flanders. now since you know everything, who was jack the ripper?
i had to -- i heard a hubbub, bub.
you come to me for help rememberin'? that's like asking your horse to do your taxes, which i did back in nineteen ninety-eight.
wait, i know someone who can help ya -- a doctor who helps people dig up old memories.
punch that orderly who takes sips out of my juice.
mr. simpson, i have built a device that will enable you to explore your memories. the science was easy, but now i've got the hard part, coming up with a name.
uhh...
hmm...
ah, my first christmas. such great chinese food.
to me, "nerd" stands for "not even remotely dorky," so thank you. thank you for the compliment. now you'll feel a slight pinch... followed by an extremely painful pinch. signaling that the spike will begin boring into your skull three seconds later.
yes, that's right, boring.
oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way.
another me? you can watch the kids.
yo, homer! can you take me to when you were ten to see if i can kick your butt?
you're superior to me in every way!
what is it you want from me? money? weed?
dad, you just destroyed your first kiss.
uh... apu.
hey, what's going on here?!
duffman!
i'm just givin' it to your wife. she is gonna be sore tomorrow.
good one.
don't worry about our happiness -- for once, think of yourself. 
oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way. we were planning a surprise party for you.
this magic marker's running out of ink. i'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
oh yeah! duff beer is sponsoring the party, featuring new duff champagne -- the beer of champagnes!
stop, homer! please! my eye!
homie, this is your party!
geez, homer, i can't believe your plan actually worked.
i've spit in every drink i ever served you. bottoms up!
because i didn't want him finding out about the party. i mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring sarah, and i just don't care for that woman.
you know, there's an after-party at the bottom of the ocean. this is good for two free drinks.
because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee.
aren't you going to drink?
we can't leave work till you do!
i hope he's not telling that stupid story about hang gliding again. 
don't you remember what today is?
i'm just really worried about your weight. bart says that we got a call from nasa and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
thank you!
there, there, cheesy mcmayor. no one likes weepy meat.
this election is on every channel.
i think it's exciting -- springfield is the center of the political universe. i feel like a pundit in a think tank!
but i was in "die hard."
opinions about the ads.
who should america elect in two thousand eight? former governor vincent aleppo said in the new york times, "i will protect the nation from attack."
but in that same issue of the new york times, they also printed an article about terrorist leader nussaf al mustaffi.
and ye shall judge them by the company they keep.
i feel exactly the opposite but the same.
stop all this pandering!
what're we gonna do? we can't not vote. nobody does that!
sorry.
chief wiggum!
roll over, anne coulter, and tell james carville the news: springfield voters have overwhelmingly rejected the major candidates of both parties in favor of a write-in: eight-year-old ralph wiggum. shockingly, this new face is now favored by fifty-three percent of likely voters. a new frontrunner has been crowned!
lisa, i'm sure this wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter.
ow!
the constitution? i'm pretty sure the patriot act killed it to ensure our freedoms.
dad, i'm freezing.
we wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!
hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets.
we're in every kind of therapy!
the nineties? never heard of it.
unfortunately, as i later learned, that wasn't heroin. it was insulin. homer really did need those injections.
did you two ever get back together?
well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- homie is where my heart is.
this is a terrible valentine's day.
and i love you, tootsie roll...
mr. simpson, this damage will take a week to fix. while your car's in the shop, you can drive this loaner.
she's right here.
nothin'.
on the contrary. the loaner car is complimentary. it's standard policy.
okay, so--
whoa, fancy wheels. what song does the horn play?
cut it out!
no.
there's this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.
really, dad?
you're right. i'm gonna go to school tomorrow and show everyone i'm awesome.
no, i'm kind of embarrassed about it.
did you just unlock the car from here?
i never dreamed an american car designed in germany, assembled in mexico from parts made in canada, could be so amazing.
dad?
jeez louise. are you okay?
it's your new diet!
homer, did you know i used to weigh four hundred pounds?
well, i went from fat to "all that" using my simple, foolproof diet. it's all about little substitutions. instead of french toast for breakfast, why not eat a bell pepper? when you crave something sugary, eat a bell pepper. want a beer? bell pepper!
bell peppers! pipin' cold! crunchy and bland!
you've gained seven pounds!
homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
searching for evidence. i know your father's cheating on his diet.
that's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
it's four o'clock on a saturday.
nothing!
bart, i have a plan: we go to the morgue and come back with a hand. put its fingerprints all over the railing... why are you being so quiet, bart? are you judging me? please don't judge me. i can't live with the guilt. i'm going to martin's house... to end it all!
homer jay simpson!
oh no you don't. let him have it, marge!
wait in line for a book? you tell 'em bart says "hey".
okay, i'm gonna hand out colored bracelets. the color on your bracelet will determine--
tv! tv! tv!
oh. oh.
i think you've got a point! homie, i'm gonna be a dancer!
you have a drinking problem?
gay out?
dad... marinating with you is cool.
step into our jerkatorium. what the?!
you have wasted my time! you have made a very powerless enemy. good day and be well!
you can skip the "k" and the "y" -- i do not thank you and i will not come again.
well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints...
as the oak said to the beagle, you're barkin' up the wrong tree. i spent the whole morning blackin' out the "goshes" and "darns" in these hardy boys books.
homer, you ate their jerky.
dad, you never win a fight with animals. remember when you lost that war with the worms?
dad! dad, a little help?
what am i doing? i don't need secondhand smoke to do ballet. i need firsthand smoke!
a sturgeon is a fish.
oh homie, i've been so happy lately. i'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! now what did you want to say to me?
there's nothing that makes a mother's heart soar more than seeing her child take wing. look at me, i'm glowing!
homie, lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy.
that's easy for you to say. you've never had to be thin and focused.
i'm just saying it's gonna be hard for me to quit, especially before the recital.
is it bart?
who was that?
five minutes, ladies.
what if someone catches him?
does that mean i can stop training to be a mexican wrestler?
it's night?!
you can just drop me off here.
order! order!
oh, right. dad was colonel homer and he wore that awesome suit and lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! but i forget how mom felt about it...
ms. lumpkin owed fifty thousand dollars in back taxes. with penalties, interest and the celebrity resentment tax, that sum has grown to twelve million dollars. however, she's been missing for several years, since her career went into a downward spiral.
shh! i'm more wanted than the last petal on a bloomin' onion.
listen, i'm sorry i called you all those mean things like, oh, i don't even remember...
sadly, no. most of my money went to my ex-husbands.
so that's it. she's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
i made that hug happen!
aww, well, you don't need a t-shirt for that, tootsie pop. 'cause i ain't ever gonna leave you again.
yeah, all i see is a gut with knees!
fine with me. look, i packed you a bag.
no problem. i bought you a hat.
and here comes grampa with an otter!
i'm really worried about lurleen.
uh, yeah...
colonel, you're still my knight in white polyester.
babe, i need a hundred bucks for beer.
so dean martin would show up at the last minute and do everything in just one take?
but wikipedia said he was passionate about rehearsal.
hey, check it out! i wouldn't mind driving that over a prairie dog village! honk to the driver! martin?! what's a tool like you doing on something cool like that?
can i join, dad? can i? can i? can i?
not this one.
oh man.
i'll get your fabrics!
ow! what was that for?
you are now entering the killing floor.
why do we have to get here so early? the football game doesn't start for hours.
it's just forks and plates. didn't we bring any food?
you brought us here to beg?
no, us!
no dad, i want you to play homer simpson.
okay everyone -- just be yourself. don't look in the camera, pretend i'm not here, and... no toupees...
and... let's roll.
dad, no! my movie got in! i'm going to the sundance film festival!
i can't believe i'm a director with a movie at sundance.
i try to answer that question in my films.
i can eat a raw onion without crying.
yeah, but i'm crying about something else.
this is it! my premiere!
i'm lisa simpson. and this is my family.
they're like the family from hell on acid that's on steroids!
oh, i was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life.
"lisa simpson's unflinching, darkly comic family portrait is the can't-miss hit of the festival. landspeeder, do not bantha, to your nearest cinema to see lisa simpson stab her family in the back with her camera."
i'm sorry. you're too late. i have just hit enter, sending the wi-fi beams along their way.
let me get a picture of you strangling my kid!
hey, we pay your salary.
thank god they're not jeering at us anymore.
lead-based toys! lead-based toys!
wow -- this guy could put milhouse out of business.
homer is a lard butt.
homer has booger breath.
homer is a big jerk.
dung muncher. / stink brains. / cheese wang. / captain crud.
yo we're rockin' out balls / tub of tard. / crapper clogger. / fatty-watty.
uh, mom? we've got a code four.
the door's open! i think someone broke in!
i hear noises coming from the kitchen!
who cares? if you kill him, we'll be on tv!
hello, homer.
homie, what's going on?
homer, i'm sorry i had to pretend to be dead. but it worked, because the government isn't looking for me anymore. i can finally stop running and be your mom.
what do you mean?
homer, i'm through protesting and chaining myself to things. i've realized that the most important thing in my life is you.
you already ate the whole thing.
anyway, the right guard keeping cool under pressure award goes to--
homer, are you okay?
sweetheart, when i left you, it was because i thought i could make the world a little bit better. maybe all i did was make my own world a lot worse. i only hope you can forgive me.
i understand -- these things take time. goodnight.
i'm still with you, son.
come on, homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever.
okay, comforting, comforting... uh dad, whenever i would hang out with grandma, she would always ask me about you. and i'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad.
that bad.
sorry about your ma, homer.
yes, i will.
look homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our lord, who came back as bread. that's it.
homer, look what i found with your mother's things.
and lastly, for homer, i leave you something very special.
go to springfield monument park and climb to the highest point. at exactly three o'clock, release my ashes. i love you, homer. and now, because they're your favorite, please enjoy some animal bloopers.
it's not really avenging her, dad. just the fulfillment of her last wish.
hey, homer! your butt still looks big from down here!
you know, spiritually speaking, grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... so, in a way... uh... i'm lying down now.
excuse me, i think i'm holding up better than you are. in fact, i've got energy to spare.
guidance system destroyed. launch aborted.
you're not supposed to like it!
are you hurt?
here's your mother.
hey, i've seen your wife. she's no mamie van doren.
i suppose there's no harm in telling you. i'm using the rocket to dispose of springfield's nuclear waste -- by sending it straight to the heart of the amazon rainforest!
well, maybe she'll like it better filled with dying trees and mutated animals.
excellent.
homer! hey, homer! here's gramma's knife!
that's already a thing -- thimbles, right?
fine.
homie?
but she'll live on forever in what you did today.
thank you! thank you! wow, four thousand episodes -- seems like just yesterday krusty stole his first joke from me. seriously, though, i remember watching him as a kid, and i thought "i could do that -- and i'm a kid!" what i love about krusty is, he's always on... but to find out what, you've gotta test his pee!
krusty klovnen baby visker?
it's clown trouble. that's your responsibility.
yeah, well, we're adding clowns.
wait, wait, wait! i'll start you off with this bicentennial quarter...and i'll throw in my man scrunchie.
all right, time to fill these slots with coins. specific coins? this hobby sucks!
wow, i never thought of it like that.
you bet i do.
slide in the eighteen sixty-three confederate half-dime... and every slot is full.
"...was mistakenly minted in december of 1917, when a brief glimpse of a woman's ankle caused three days of rioting at the philadelphia mint."
one of these has got to be that smooching lincoln penny. nope... nope... dime... button... pepperoni slice...
nope... nope... nope...
our last item up for bid is a mint-condition 1917 "kissing lincoln" penny.
five hundred.
dad?
ten million.
mmm... i paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it.
yes, but the problem is, if you had it, i wouldn't. you see the difficulty...
now, let's put it on a shelf and never look at it again.
i already don't! homer, i've got great news!
granted! homer simpson?! you are a repeat offender.
bail is set at twenty-five thousand dollars.
we'll put up your bail money. just pay us ten per cent and show up for your court date.
then you gotta deal with me. the name's wolf and i'm a bounty hunter. if someone skips bail i track 'em down and bring 'em back. i also take a tooth, make a plaster cast, put it on this necklace then replace the tooth at my expense. well, time to go back to my world of sleazy bars, tattoo parlors, and greasy spoons.
so wait -- are we telling people now?
bullet-proof glass.
maybe you're right. maybe i should...
homer, you could've killed him!
now i can clearly see potential customers walk right past my store. enjoy your shopping elsewhere!
what the?
well... i could use money. but you have to promise me something, homer.
we have to do everything by the book.
dear lord, thank you for creating so many evil criminals for us to bring in. and also, thank you for my partner homer, who... did you just taser my coffee?
homer, can we take it easy on the taser?
our first bail jumper!
homer, take the taser out of your pants.
whoa! there's still bullets in some of these!
what'd you get for me?
dad, is this from a meth lab?
this is evidence.
oh, homie. i got you something too. a sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
how dare you?!
sorry, sorry muscle spasm.
homer, i don't think we have the same musical tastes.
i like their christian cover band: a.d.-b.c.! kindly deeds / done for free / kindly deeds
hm. i've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
man, that's harder to swallow than evolution.
not bad.
oh, kitten whiskers!
homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway! you need a special sticker just to bring a bike! have you no respect for the law?
homer, no! you promised... everything was supposed to be by the book!
this partnership is over!
you know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas.
oh no! those were for mr. smithers' commitment ceremony!
i hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
homie, what do you say we go to bed? you, me and the cake?
you jumped bail, homer. i gotta bring you in.
i figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at lisa's recital.
lucky guess.
for the last few weeks. but most of the time i've known you you've treated me like dirt!
i forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
i like you too, but you broke the law. so i've got to bring you in.
thanks, but... what are you holding on to?
simpson, we're gonna put you away for a long, long time.
don't feel too bad, homie. you'll be free tomorrow. and i used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me.
bonehead.
lady, you are the best mom ever!
okay, bart went to the comic book store. bullies!
what are you two doing in the laundry room?
dad, do laundry.
look at bart go! he must be running away!
oh my god, he's out of frame! zoom out! zoom out! he's circling the shelbyville bird sanctuary.
pull over -- bart's in this field!
are we ever going to find him?
bart! where are you, bart?
so i can't always be there for bart. he's got to learn to take care of himself.
where's maggie?
look at me! i'm doin' something!
mr. homer, why don't you forget your worries with this -- the last lottery ticket on the roll. they say the last one is lucky! unlike all the others. lucky! or not.
that is true. another ironic "tale of the kwik-e-mart".
i thought it was fifty.
hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger.
now homer, boys will be boys.
oh cheer up, homer. the drinks are on lenny.
dang that bart! thanks to him, i have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat.
why can't our son just behave?
they're not boogers! they're clumps of rubber cement. that i stored in my nose.
thank you for being a friend...
hm, i don't know. i'm pretty attached to my family, and...
maybe i'm just not hungry.
father, could you--
please stop spitting food on me!
keep your food in your mouth, you semi-literate spew-monkey!
maybe he's going through... certain changes.
homer, it's not a real paper -- it's a rubber chew toy!
so now bart is on his way to aspen, where they're going to try to kill him!
there's bart!
are you guests at the lodge?
your favorite, sir. hot fudge sundae with gold leaf and diamond flakes.
i can't listen to this anymore.
aw... young love.
i don't know...
and in that mud, i'm plantin' the seed of friendship. name's ned flanders! as the elephant said to the peanut vendor, toss those in my trunk!
put 'er there, muddy buddy.
really? not married? and you were bicycling two abreast?
since two this afternoon. welcome to our honeymoon!
homer simpson, i would be delighted not to marry you.
i'm cuckoo for killing stuff!
i can't believe homer ruined another family picnic.
your neck looks like a sideways ass!
that's the fuel gauge.
you haven't said you're sorry.
of course -- it's just past the sushi bar, behind the limbo pit, right in front of the blackjack table. and feel free to stay. we just put out the cheese -- we have cubes of yellow, cubes of orange, and cubes of orange and yellow.
we'll stay for one hand roll or two nigiri -- then we have to get back to the kids!
oh, for me?
you're a funny one. that's strong -- are you trying to get me drunk?
you know, my horoscope said i'd meet the man of my dreams tonight.
you are adorable! are you... alone?
well then, would you like to limbo?
why are you dancing with that strange woman?
how about a sushi fight?
thanks for the lift.
a log cabin? what am i, davy crockett? also, who's davy crockett?
they're worse than wal-king!
i'll take ten bucks no-ow.
well, when the sun goes down it means god's gone to china to watch over those good folks. time for some shuteye.
sorry, homer, i'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds.
that's just your trouser devil talking!
goodnight, marge. sweet dreams, my new best friend. oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart? aw, maude. your dead grandmother's pajamas. you know what that does to me.
you don't need her, baby. sylvia's got everything you want.
pineapple and pepperoni.
eh-eh-eh! first we make love, then we decide if it was a good idea. that's the european way.
homer, i can be whoever you want me to be.
why do married women always have husbands?
uh... the same thing you're doing here.
we sure did. rekindle, rekindle... okay, let's go.
fine. but i don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.
okay, but first the chest.
homie, what's taking so long?
homie?
and we'll stay up forever!
homer simpson, you devil!
homer simpson, you devil! but i think we should unpack first...
i can't believe one of the most beautiful moments in our marriage is based on lies!
okay.
so... i'm sure you missed marge last night.
what a charming single entendre. now look, i know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever.
okay, here she comes! why don't you take marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?
you make me feel that way too.
what are you doing?
take my hand!
homer, our marriage isn't on a piece of bark! it's in us! now take my hand! /
me neither, homie.
i know. we had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. the important thing is, we love each other.
knock it off back there.
okay, but keep it pg.
pg-13.
make that sixteen. lousy dog. if you had your way, i'd walk you every day.
any of you lugs wanna break up with my boyfriend for me? i'll buy you a beer!
splendid! shall we discuss music, or the weather?
she wants to break up?
with me?
gee. compared to you, my life is one big half-day!
is lenny here?
what? i just talked to him.
homer? it's your old roommate, grady.
grady is breaking up with me?!
in his what? awww. oh, baby, you are the breakup king. you have made the seven minutes that i'm gonna go without love so much more bearable.
that's one of your breakup lines! what would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time i had my doubts about you?
homie?
cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
no, none.
it's kind of a secret, so shut the door most of the way. we found a way to make this tournament interesting. we bet on the matches.
agreed. so, who are you gonna bet on?
he has a name, you know!
i win!
dad, i could actually win this thing!
my only fear is, i always sabotage myself when i'm on the verge of happiness.
in my young life i've seen that every time i'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says "you don't deserve this." and another little piece says "i agree."
wish me luck.
i'll take your money. but i won't look you in the eye.
here's your money. drenched in your daughter's tears.
and there's something different about him. he bought new shoelaces. with fancy metal tips! dad? did you come into some money we don't know about?
you got highlights in your hair!
and your car antenna has been straightened and re-balled. what's goin' on?
no, i'm not mad.
hey, mr. s... lisa b...
would you like to buy some band candy?
she may never take back your name, but there's still a chance she'll take you back as a daddy.
a couple hours? i can do the sunday puzzle in less than one hour! a couple of hours... "last clue: "loses on purpose". hmmm... "diets!" oh, will shortz, you clever rascal. and a new record time! wait a second... "dumb dad sorry for his bet." wow, it's almost as if dad planted that message. no, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? oh, it must be...or mustn't it not? dad, i know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the new york times crossword puzzle?
take a look at the first letters of all the clues.
um... i'm also returning this kitten calendar.
i see you're admiring our mycube. it's fueled by dreams and powered by imagination.
you should ask yourself, "what can i do for it?"
sir, it's not even turned on yet.
what have you done with the old ones?
salaam alaikum!
bart forgot this, sir.
you know, bart never told me he had a handsome teenage brother.
why don'tcha ask homer? he oughtta know, by dint of his son's new friend. 
homer, this is serious. this bashir kid is muslim, and therefore up to something.
under your statue of liberty's dress! and she loved it!
homie, it's very open-minded of you to have bart's muslim friend's muslim family over.
we met while studying at jordan university of science and technology.
now bait the trap.
no, thank you.
i like the way you italians think.
i think it is time for us to go.
you're teaching bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!
well, i want you to go over to their house and apologize!
homer, i'm sure you didn't see anything. go to sleep.
you rubbed? you must like me. you really, really like me! good morrrning, ramadan! come to crazy fayeddie's! our prices are hussein! heeeeere's genie!
no, now i will destroy your decadent western society.
but i love blowing up buildings.
oh, it's you. what do you want?
mr. simpson, i accept your apology. goodbye.
yes.
that's allah!
homer? i don't hear almond grinding!
no, i...
dad, it was an empty building. it was supposed to come down!
that was supposed to open tomorrow.
the duff brewery is on that island.
fortune four lotto numbers are: nine...
seven...
three...
and...
dad, we have to do something -- all the bees are dying! but dad, bees pollinate flowers.
honey?
bees.
i'm glad you called me. i know i'm not the first scientist in the phone book. that's associate professor aaron ableman, how i hate him. thundering thorax, it's just exactly what i feared! ...in there. close. see these red dots? this bee has been felled by bee measles -- or as i call it, "beasles."
i'm going to talk to the girl from now on.
uh-huh...
never being a grandmother?
um mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes.
dad, don't eat the bees!
listen lisa, i was trying to think of a way to help your bees and i remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town.
silence! now, let's make some noise for everyone's favorite basketball team, whom i have renamed the springfield excitement.
okay, okay! don't know why i had 'em in the first place.
really? listen homer, in the back room i got these super-tough africanized bees. i saw this ad in a gentleman's magazine for excited african honeys, and that's what they sent me. if we could combine them with lisa's bees, it would make them strong enough to survive any environment.
actually homer...
no, the bees!
got the queen?
wow, this must be important, dad! i've never seen you walk up an incline before.
they sound awfully mad. are they dangerous?
why do we have to go to the rec center? i wanna play with my friends!
you're older. why don't you do these fun activities?
we could be murderers.
he found several undiscovered plot twists in "the client." and he proved that the real villain in "a time to kill" is the legal system itself.
great! here are a few "best friend" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--
i just said that.
now remember, juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior.
nice doorbell. is it computerized?
homer!
homer, isn't it wonderful that my juliet and your lisa have become such fast friends?
dinner's ready!
i'll go get her!
i'm not that kind of doctor!
that's chewing gum.
mr. and mrs. simpson, we need to talk about lisa. she's unfocused, scribbling nonsense, living in a world of her own.
we're talking about lisa, your daughter.
ah yes, the one i've seen on lisa's facebook page. i search all the children's facebook pages for unflattering references to me. by the way, i enjoyed the photos of your trip to yosemite.
i wonder if lisa has threatened the model u.n. with her rice tariff yet.
a "castle"... i know where they are!
no!
you probably would.
you got a letter all the way from new york city, and that's something!
homer, that guy's your age?
so you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?
what about sunday?
your father's just jealous because vance was our class president in high school.
dad, you ran for class president?
there they are, my favorite mixed-race couple!
he looks happy.
he's not crying and he's not known for clowning.
clear a path, boys.
hey, homer simpson! how you been?
behind this smile is a bigger smile trying to get out. oh. oh here it comes! oh yeah!
got 'em from a buddy of mine with a store in shelbyville. you want his number?
hey, homer, you wanna try my new vance connor-politan? like vance, it is smooth, cool and oh-so-sophisticated.
yeah, me too.
just let it go, homer.
finally, you returned my shovel.
california casual or business attire?
there it is!
no, this is the box that tells us where the ballot box is. right under this.
homer simpson...
homer simpson...
homer simpson.
please stop doing that.
both. homer simpson... vance connor... fonzie... homer simpson... and the winner is homer simpson!
hey!
dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better.
no other foursome would have me. my legs gross people out.
uh-oh. looks like one of my former students on a quest for truth.
i can explain. but... are you sure we should talk in front of your son?
i already knew that, dad. i'm gonna blame you.
with a virgin tom collins for me?
very well. it's a fact i didn't like you, simpson. still don't.
oh, you could know. if you dared.
you see too much. now, watch the sauce of bubbling red and see the life you could have led.
ho-mer! ho-mer! ho-mer!
ask-a the garlic bread.
homie, please, nothing good will come of this.
homer, do you have a date for the prom yet? sorry, the only girl i could ever want is right over there...
thank you, homer.
nobody's ever asked me to use my head-brain before!
oh my god. he's talking to me.
homer simpson! i was gonna let you get to fifth base! it would've been something you told your grandchildren about!
who wants a cheerleader on the rebound?
i can hardly believe this is real.
i don't know, but in this reality, i am not gay! hubba hubba!
young man, you have the noble bearing of the barbarian leader vercingetorix .
tell me, what student government office do you hold? secretary? treasurer? dare i say secretary-treasurer?
well, that's what's missing. our lives would be horrible without the kids.
homie, please come inside.
dad, we need to have a talk.
dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong.
oh really?
yep. in the future, people will look at this and they'll say "whoever he was, he must've mattered."
pardon me... can my son have his picture taken with you?
well, we can't all be homer simpson, son.
plaques come, plaques go.
how 'bout italian?
i hear there's a korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.
it's the first day of school!
i can't believe we have to start another year of school. i never learned anything at that suck shack.
kid at school.
oh homie, the insurance bill is due today. can you make sure to mail it?
woo-hoo! test day at last! now i can show off at a federal level. hey bart, on the practice test yesterday, what did you pick as the best title for the paragraph about "manifest destiny?" dad, bart's throwing away his future!
i.d., please.
homie! what are you doing home so early?
you mean back to the poor house?
i don't want anyone to ever get hurt.
we can discuss it later. right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club.
oh my god! oh my god! we're totally liable!
van johnson was never half the man van heflin was. oops.
apaches!
no, sweetie. at this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. who was i to think you could mail an envelope?
there's twelve more boxes. and they all sound the same!
what about my birthday party?
hey homer, i have some distant relatives that i never see except for this party. can i bring 'em to the party?
can't talk now, dear. it's four in the morning here in zurich. oh, right. we came together.
i noticed.
homer, i always wonder, how can you afford this party year after year?
huh. i'm not sure that's how it works.
but, but, but...
homie, do you know anything about this?
i think we should go see our mortgage broker.
oh, wait. i left out a zero.
don't be sore at the banks. hell, we fired our c.e.o., and he barely got out with fifty million dollars!
i know, i know. but bernice wants you out.
did you remember to disconnect it first?
she is. look.
i need a place to store my cufflinks.
well sir, as the ocean said to the dirt, i appreciate the sediment.
come on, kids! let's take our stuff back inside.
for he's a fabulous flanders, which nobody can deny!
homie, the faucet won't stop leaking.
well, let's see what else is in the job jar.
he won't come over!
the rent check is late.
people like flanders make me sick. if i was marge's landlord i'd fix her pipes and i'd shower her with flowers and-and take her on a romantic getaway to the south seas and i... i'd never return.
well, here's how you get back at flanders: you go to the media and get them to expose what a horrible person he really is.
hey, dad.
you want a cookie, dad?
i died when homer sat on me!
homer simpson, i took pity on you, and what do i get in return? a kick in the kadiddlehopper!
it's not funny! that's how i swear!
when the month is up, i want you out!
your leaving is our christmas!
wha? who's that?
uh, say, "jesus," what was the name of the son of zachariah?
hm, i wonder if it's theses.
homie, i think it's an eviction notice. we're gonna be homeless, like lucille ball in "the stone pillow"!
wheee! i'm gonna live like a human in a real house! what's the catch?
for what?
right, 'cause i wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes billie jean king, susan sontag, sappho of lesbos, and, i suspect, peppermint patty...
we know, dad. we were there.
flanders feeds me people food!
oh my god. we're out on the street!
but kicking is the only toy i have.
well, hasn't this been a peach of a breach! we'll see you in court.
it's okay if you backslide a little.
i'm gonna see it first!
hit the road, ya big load!
we have totality, people! 
for years... for years...
now simpsons, i must warn you -- any stress could increase the blood pressure in marge's eyeballs, leading to what we call "tex avery syndrome."
you guys have treated me like a princess. every day's been like the first ten minutes of mother's day!
dad! come in the kitchen! quick!
wha--
look at that -- one of god's discarded miracles.
sir, our mission is quite clear. any child left here will be cared for by the sisters of st. teresa. why would you leave such a beautiful baby on our doorstep?
no. the poor dear is right where she belongs. god help you, sir!
wait, i have an idea! one of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent.
homie, i haven't held maggie all day. can you hand her to me?
ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! who's a chubby baby? but that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner. hm. you're not usually this greedy.
maybe i'm just being selfish. i don't know.
you told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!
i'm sorry for fibbing. tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home.
well that sucked! / there's a day we'll never get back! / i was so bored.
what is that soothing sound?
getting a back rub from an orgasm.
oh, you mean the "yousoup 5000."
if i'm more relaxed i'll be a better mom! can we? can we? wait a minute, who am i pleading with?
maybe we should get out now.
hey, cool your jets! we're trying to get to sleep!
one of us should go look at it.
the thing is, i ain't got much life left to live. and a wasted day like today is one i know i'll never get back.
well, there are a few things i was hopin' to do before i become dust in a jar.
anyway, i made a list.
that's right. now let's make our reservations.
everyone got jobs, that's what happened.
d'ye mean it? look, don't toy with an old man's heart, now.
this is the life in ire-land...
i just had a nightmare... that i was back with your mother! 
so long, suckers!
that takes care of my next one. never heard of half this stuff! this brandy is fifty years old. better toss it.
i'm in a.a.
i'm late for a teleconference with hong kong, ya fat gob!
sorry, but smokin' in pubs ain't part of the new ireland. also, you can't text while driving.
bite your tongue! that will never, ever happen!
no, it's how you fly coach on delta now.
what has happened to the ways of old?
homer and his da!
so, it's escapin' you're thinkin' of, then?
son, this was all my fault. you were just trying to make an old man happy.
oh son, you know how i love a good analogy.
the parson?! he's coming here?
well, i'm afraid that joyous occasion fell during a time when i wasn't actually a minister. uh, since that time, you two have not been legally wed.
who are you calling an old lady?
yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock.
this isn't the most romantic place to get married.
hello?
homer, what's going on? the violin, pants with a crease, why?
oh yes, homer! yes!
well, the last time i checked, pirates weren't gay.
that's for a child's birthday. we're going to get this one.
no rockets! you can pick the frosting.
all right, people, i want every table to have two baskets of bread but only one plate of butter -- that will stimulate conversation.
there is no "we" in wedding!
i can't believe you told lenny and carl they could bring dates! 'cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
because their r.s.v.p. cards arrived one day after the deadline!
you're going to be here a while.
as of now, your pathetic little life means nothing.
to remove that chain, you need the key to the lock.
the lollipop is made of hot sauce.
...fun with fire ants?
wow, you're the smartest guy in that room.
he's right here.
i'm just happy you're back. now let's get that chain off you.
and with the inking and application of this stamp, you are officially married. next!
just what i always wanted.
oh, ya hate to see this.
as we enter the seventh amazing overtime, the members of sesame street on ice wait impatiently to begin their matinee performance. hold the black label, mabel! the utica mohawks' pete mavroudis has broken through the 'topes' defense!
you're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
so that will do it from wayne bockhorn, jean-pierre pétomane, and me, doc jacques lalonde, here at utica's kill-kwik rat poison arena.
now stay tuned for "picking the perfect apple," it's already in progress.
you want to know the score? i'll tell you the score.
here's the score, mister:
your daughter barely knows who you are!
maggie.
can you at least bring a sweater for maggie?
i'm spiffin' up the place! jeez, can't a guy clean his bar for the first time ever without people makin' polite inquiries? huh. i got a window here.
ooh, hey maggie! maggie, maggie, maggie!
'cause he can't remember limericks?
it's a-a-b-b-a, dumbass!
dad, do you have any idea what's gotten into maggie?
you've been spending so much time with her.
here she is, uh, homer. the wonderful girl i been tellin' you about.
well... if i remember my high school physics, the controlled nuclear reaction creates steam which powers a turbine...
all right, homer. let's see what my baby's been up to.
okay, no more delays. i've got to watch this.
homer simpson, you are a strong finisher.
what's the matter, homer?
yeah, i wish i could say the same.
uh... i... i spend a lot of time working with this mentally-challenged guy. why, here he is now. lookin' good, homer!
just wait.
we believe lisa is suffering from environment related despair.
lisa is a little young to be taking "happy pills."
no angle. um, if this girl i'm seeing comes here, and she might, i wouldn't mind if you told her i was the kind of boy that does the dishes.
i can't believe she dumped me!
maybe we should just check out the street performers.
it's like a sauna in here! it is a sauna in here. must've been put in by a previous owner. this house is full of surprises. but this is the first good one. i can't wait to tell everyone!
dad, yes!
no it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!
yeah, sure. it's complimentary.
now homer, how would you like me to remove it -- yanky or peely? got it.
oh, i thought that was a y, for "yanky." i'll make a note in your chart that you aren't always clear.
homer, you have become a super-taster. the mildest spices will overwhelm your tongue. even a taco could drive you insane.
cinco.
try these beets. i boiled all the red out.
dad, i've got the perfect thing.
it's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. the blandest food known to man.
pecan blandies... cream of steam... you guess 'ems...
lunch card... lunch card... lunch card?
dad, what are you doing here?
what? no!
three dollars and eighty-five cents.
i'll start you on jell-o.
i used to date your daughter.
dad, do you have to hang out at my school? it's bad enough i have to be here three days a week!
albany! annapolis atlanta! augusta! austin! baton rouge! bismarck! boise! boston! capital city! carson city!
that's why i'm here -- to make sure he gets good grades.
well, call me over-involved, but some day your son will be my son's chauffeur.
it's not your son's fault, it's yours. you have to hover over your kid's shoulder to force him to succeed. it's called "helicopter parenting."
well, i...
noah. i like that name. no-ahhh. noah. noah!
am i?
la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
don't forget, children -- monday is the balsa-wood model-building competition. the american balsa council will award this year's winner a thousand-dollar savings bond for their college education.
my mistake.
dad, if i join a clique, i'll be the kind of person i hate.
hmm, well, they are good ones.
well that's very nice of you-- hey! you sayin' my clothes are clown-like? oh god, i feel so insecure! please be my friend...
i do! / yeah! / you know it! / oh boy!
no, oh sure, no, uh no... that's all right. if i didn't sell booze, they probably wouldn't even come here.
dad, i don't want to hurt people's feelings.
we'd like some balsa wood, please.
what scale are you using?
washington monument? aren't you gonna even try?
i'm your son's principal, and the washington monument is the most uninspired model choice there is. it's like saying "i don't care. my kid's a loser."
hmm, that would be westminster abbey.
you won't get past the north transept!
blabby's gonna build an abbey. groovy.
isn't this supposed to be my project?
do you want me to watch and learn?
homer, don't give up till you finish my dear abbey.
that's terrible advice.
oh, and where is this delightful boy?
homer, there are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.
experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes.
these days, man knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
flawless... stunning... awe-inspiring... meticulous... skin-ner! these models are clearly the work of meddling parents! the only entry that repels my eye enough to be constructed by a student is this one! congratulations, son. at least you followed the rules.
why can't you guys let us do things for ourselves. in the words of oscar wilde: "experience is simply the name we give to our mistakes." i saw him too, dad.
i'm sorry, dad. these girls are nice on the surface, but it's hard work staying this shallow. i hope you understand.
no, there's a middle ground.
not if you use a dimmer switch.
what's wrong, homie?
well, i know a place in this house where you can really relax.
no, i gave that to the homeless shelter.
feeling better, super dad?
look at this: springfield elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm.
wait, wait, wait. you're putting us in a new school?! what about my friends?
ah, so cheap, eh?
no windows, no parking, and a man died here.
right here.
in the ethiopian restaurant at the end of the block.
it's just a formality to make sure you actually live here. some people use the address just so their kids can go to our schools.
call it, friendo.
well done. now, let me validate your parking.
it's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.
you just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. you can come home when the heat's off.
please just stay there till bart graduates high school.
brought you a housewarming present.
hey, are you into poker?
this man-crush just got bro-mantic!
definitely a cup.
does she have a sister?
we don't need a bed. we're not gonna be sleeping.
you know what a girl likes, mister. so, can i see you again?
i love tapas! it's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
and i've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment.
surprise! i redecorated!
you don't need a wii now that i'm here. because you and me make "us."
where have you been? we have mirrors to hang!
without me? how'd you get there?
without me?
"go dog go" with pages missing... lego spaceship poorly assembled... clearly, this is the home of elementary school children. too bad. i was looking forward to killing you and making it look like a suicide.
i am not your friendo.
your comments when we watch movies aren't funny.
please, i just want to go back to a place where i'm ostracized for being me, not for who i pretend to be.
get a room!
but...
deal.
i wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
i thought i was marrying a man who could play macbeth.
i think mel would be happier as an understudy. a six-feet-understudy.
wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting "i dare not" wait upon "i would?"
snore. snore.
that "crazy talk" is the work of the immortal bard, william shakespeare.
you don't even know your lines!
that's "bye-bye birdie"!
tonight the springfield community playhouse was bathed in the light of a brilliant new star... dr. hibbert as banquo?!
he's the one getting the good reviews! which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
macbeth!
"in last night's 'macbeth,' the best performance was barney gumbel as duncan, followed by duffman as macduff, lenny leonard as lennox, eddie and lou as the two soldiers without lines, then last and least, the lead, homer simpson."
all i heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. unless you're not man enough.
that's where you're wrong! get out on that stage!
okay homer, it's our last performance, you're the only actor that's still alive, and there's nobody in the audience -- this is your moment. i'll be in my office going over the books on my subway sandwich franchise. you call a sandwich maker an artist, it's like an invitation to steal! a guy's goin' nani-nooni bananas in there!
now nothing will stop you from taking on all of shakespeare's greatest roles: king lear... hamlet... othello... richard the third... henry the fourth, part one... henry the fourth, part two... henry the fifth... titus andronicus...
don't you latté-sipping leeches understand? i've seen enough of these hollywood super-hunks -- we need a dumpy, unappealing loser -- an everyman!
you... are... acceptable!
well, i qualified for the national math bee--
guess who the garden club elected president?
no. i lost.
dr. hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough--
homer, we have a problem.
we need you to slim down, muscle up and become the "everyman" people want to be instead of the one they actually are.
maybe...i can help lyle mccarthy.
here's what brad and angelina looked like before they met me.
homer, do you know why you eat?
something bad happens and you cope by cramming a donut in your mouth.
i'm gonna teach you healthy emotional alternatives to eating. we don't have much time, so we'll do it in a montage to the song "eye of the tiger."
yeah, it's your montage.
no.
no.
i gotta take this. tobey! cider house rules! total wuss. seabiscuit, you keepin' off the sugar cubes? i hate this guy. i love this guy! tobe, tobe, tobe, we talked about this -- if the rice ain't brown, don't chow down! look, i gotta bail, i'm with everyman right now. no, no, no, no, no don't worry, he totally sucks! i'm only lying to him. goodbye! bad-bye.
hey, home town buffet, like i told john travolta, my client list is private. you know what, enough chitchat. hit the pole! stripper up! fireman down! and sexy! heroic! sexy! heroic! and sexy! heroic! earn that money!
and cut!
oh, homie... take your shirt off again. there's less of you to love, but i love you even more. what was that?!
awesome performance, homer. i smell oscar. oscar! take a shower! or a tomato bath, or something. please!
i'm being paid to do what i love!
homer? homer sapian! can i have a word with you? i know this is a bad time, but i'm leaving for another gig.
don't take it personally, home-team. just remember what i taught you.
i have taught you well. goodbye!
avery, i swear, you're the only man in gothamopolis who's never seen everyman.
come and get me. 
i think you may have put on a little weight.
well, i don't know. i might have some milk that has expired. ah, here we are... a delightful buttermilk from nineteen sixty-one. oh, sixty-one. everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer. whatever you do, do not chew the chunks.
everyman! show yourssself!
homeboy! what happened, dude? you went from everyman to everywhereman.
okay. it was turtle from "entourage."
come on, home run. it's okay, home alone. look, i'm sorry. let me make this up to you. i'll train you. then leave you again. then come back and train you. it's how i make my money.
you, me and turtle.
he is a great guy. he's an awful guy.
though legislation was passed to insure everyman was never seen on screens again, he remains in the hearts of every man, woman and child looking for justice. or just hoping to see bad people beaten up.
mr. simpson, i don't need your money. bart can definitely be a challenge, but i like challenges. and he... he's got a wild sense of humor. look at this picture he drew: 
what?
yes. just one: relax. you're clearly a caring father.
dad... am i bad on the inside?
listen... i was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?
no, i mean teacher.
what discussion?
thanks for bringing me here, dad. i'll remember this day on my deathbed.
whoa. maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
stupid romans.
sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?
sure, no problem. twenty-five dollars, please.
kill! kill! kill! kill!
mom, don't do this! this sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you! tell her, dad! you love ultimate punching even more than i do!
what the? chocolate, whipped cream... cherries! she got to you! with a piece of black forest cake!
glad you didn't come cheap.
one, two / we say boo! / three, four / stop the gore!
mom, you can't fight that guy.
thank you, homie.
or kick the crap out of you.
someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. this goes against every feminist bone in my body, but dad, can't you control your woman?
oh marge, if only i knew what these paintings meant. i know the woman i loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense.
what? you think just 'cause i'm black i know all other black people?
there must be a better way.
well let's go, "marge." my class reunion starts in an hour.
yeah, but last year i took barney dressed as marge. think how much better they'll think you look.
that's. my. son. 
two drunk guys were fighting outside and everyone went to watch.
no. let's go home. we can enjoy some mixed "marital" arts.
i'm glad you asked, kent. we start with grade a beef, feed that to other cows, then kill them and serve the unholy results on a seven-grain bun. burger squared!
the munchers got moe!
please let me in!
i'm your father and i need your help!
dad, no! that's the last book in the world!
oh my god. if bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!
if so, secrets locked within his blood could be the key to saving humanity. you must get him immediately to the safe zone, just outside of town. and if you see my wife... tell her i love her.
we don't have a panic room!
come with me if you want to live.
psst! this way!
ow! ow! ow! ow! quit it. ow! quit it.
dad, are you becoming a muncher?
where do you want it, the mouth or the eyes?
how 'bout some of my new microbrew? must be another mouse in the pipe. let's see if this cobra solves it. nothin'. just once i wish cupid / would draw back his bow / and shoot me a cutie / whose standards are low...
he what?!
that uh, that's me. i've been taking ventriloquism lessons.
read on. it gets gayer.
i/you could do...
homer?! does this mean you still love me?
i always have.
definitely hands-off. he didn't mind if we punched in a little late, or not at all...
ah, i expect you're all anxiously awaiting my choice for your new supervisor.
hmm...
the nitwits are runnin' the goofhouse!
after work. and the first beer's on me.
that'll do, homer.
he had to have part of his tongue removed. that's real funny.
great safety report, homer -- no meltdowns all week. i'm making you my new executive assistant.
and call.
homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages.
who am i kidding?
tomorrow, my love.
book me a massage.
homie?
garden view?
well, i brought a few items to make our night extra-special. massage oil... some lingerie from "the horny hubby"... and "snuggle" dice. this one has an action, and this one has a body part. see? nuzzle... neck. with pleasure!
why don't you just roll me?
dammit, why won't you touch me?
last night was the making it up to me! the most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
i can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.
you know homer, when i was your age, it was the future, "cause i'm younger than you. just something to think about.
thank you, um...
when we get back to the hotel, i want you to extend our stay... indefinitely.
homer, there is a moth in my room! where are you!?
what?! homer! return to the immortal city of light at once! or you're fired!
homie, you're back!
boy, that was worth the wait.
dad, how can you call it a ski weekend if we're going home at dawn on sunday?
smack it! whack it! thwack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! bop it! bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! bop it!
bonk-bonk-bonk it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it! bonk it! bop it! twist it! smack it! thwack it bonk it! bop it! twist it! smack it! thwack it! whack it!
bonk it! bonk it. bonnnnk it...
oh don't worry, we don't kill it. we just dip it.
what happened is, i saved your life. now you's had a rough day. why'n'tcha have a pull on this?
this here's my pride and joy: 'ol betsy.
what's your take, city boy?
things said in the circle have a surprising way of coming true.
text your mom to pick us up.
you said you were at a parenting class!
you heard sirens, which you thought were the police coming to arrest you. to ditch their stills...the moonshiners pushed them down a hill. the moonshine landed in a river, temporarily blinding anyone or anything that drank it. that river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
well, i think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in lisa's life is which boy will marry her. right, homer? homer?
hello everybody, welcome to "under the wrapper!" where i, huell howser, apply the art of detection to your favorite confections! now, here's some opening titles to sweeten the deal. hey! ow! wow. now, we've seen how cookies crumble and soda gets its pop, so let's take a close up look at america's favorite drop -- the gumdrop!
in outstanding lighting direction electronic multi-camera for variety, music or comedy programming, we have... a three-way tie!
global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.
dad... i want a baby brother.
lisa got a sister! why can't you have another boy?
you never told me how my body works.
bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.
oh what a lovely evening.
maybe we could do both.
homer simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our dvd player.
which position should we try? the yawning monkey? "the pair of tongs?"
okay!
uh-huh, and now hand me your neck...
mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
a few more minor adjustments, aaand... 
you're gonna be seeing a lot of him around the house.
so many sisters... save me, bart!
sounded like i said naked bacon.
see. we all thought it was naked--
but if you--
well, i'll tell you, you may both agree, but folksingers never say take it naked bacon.
in one minute, we'll be starting our rock-quatic roll-tacular!
you know, i did sit on a shark once...
let's give a wet and wacky welcome to springfield's oldest performing mollusk...
slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
top of the mornin', homer. seen the paper?
well, sir, it looks like your dad is a quotable notable.
...clark gable owes me a book. and he never paid me for the shoeshine. but his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. lunch butter we called it.
he does all the time. you just never listen.
ooh, i like this kid.
well, well, well -- look who decided to visit me twice in one year. this man's more of a son to me than you've ever been.
i don't think that's true.
you only care about me now because i'm famous!
ring? what ring?
and if this is homer, you're too late for my love!
maybe you're not really mad at grampa. maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.
... and that's how you win an opium war!
the yangtze river swallows all secrets.
yes, although these days i can make neither haste nor waste. you know, simpson -- this has truly been a lovely afternoon. release... a hound.
here comes the prize / pulitzer prize / i'll finally be successful / in my mother's eyes
well, at least you never tried to kill me.
i sure did. but why don't we let homer tell the story.
i think you're ready for your first ramble.
i'm hangin' on every word.
i don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.
hey, don't listen to me! what do i know about rainbows?!
i'm afraid your daily donuts are no more.
no!
easy there, habitrail.
i'm a corporate recruiter who specializes in nuclear workers.
hell no.
the krusty show sucks now. it's all pink and princessy. why are great things always ruined by women? the army... the fantastic four... think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy!
you got it, gator.
oh, i imagine cap city's been wooing you with trips to the seashore, a christmas goose, spanish lemons... folderol i can't afford to match. but please, accept this little going away present.
oh, but these aren't just any donuts. these donuts were made the old-fashioned way: the dough is sweetened with cuban sugar from pre-batista plantations, then it's deep fried in the tallow of three different animals, two of which are now extinct.
you like potato...
you like tomato...
potato!
tomato!
let's call the whole thing off...icially onnnnn! and toast... valerie and daaaaave!
can i just ask, who the hell says potato?
homie, i'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people...
homer's got a girlfriend!
mine says "something you lost will soon turn up." my faith in the lord -- it came back!
if it's your lucky day, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.
thank you, come again. who's next? hello
sí, sí...
homer! where are you?
/ / /
good evening, mr. homer, how can i--
oh thank god you're okay!
seven-oh-seven? that's exactly the moment i was furious at you for missing our toast. and now i'm the one who has to ask... can you forgive me?
wait a minute, homer! you can't spend any of that money or marge will know you lied.
the laundry. the machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it.
why don't you just buy things your family needs, and leave them where they'll find them?
that's not the money tree.
you threw it, you go find it.
ow! there's a big box in here!
that's just what we need! but how are we going to get it home?
what are you doing?
there's money in this tree. what the hell is going on?
okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?
look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. you work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot.
don't forget my cut.
so... where you from, homer?
yes, homer?
yeah. come on up. you can play the tambourine.
here we go, folks -- the ultimate zero-gravity experience!
no way! i wanna go a million more times!
rich kids don't need school! when i grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super.
oh yeah? if you don't keep splashing the cash, i'm gonna tell mom that it's thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever.
oh great, now that dad's gonna star in it.
mo-om...
homeroom, eight a.m.
mo-om...
homer! i need you to rickshaw me to soccer practice!
hey, hey, hey. let's not get crazy. if you quit, i'm telling mom everything.
okay, but just 'cause i'm your best friend, don't be afraid to use that whip.
well, i kind of got a clue when i heard that "ballooning safety" video.
you were what?!
we've got a million dollars?! screw the toast!
so we're right back where we used to be.
oh my god!
you like potato...
you like tomato...
homer, you don't look fat.
gentlemen, i'm afraid we've detected a small leak somewhere in the heavy water piping facility. don't leave until you find that leak!
you're one smart cookie, rosemary. that left boob was too good for him. we're appalling!
really? how romantic?
it's so noisy in here! i can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
this isn't fair! i want romance!
it's not the same.
ooh, ice skating. a sport that encourages hand-holding.
sorry, no skating tonight.
actually... ...it's called "curling." players slide the heavy stones toward the circle, or "house..." ...as teammates control the direction and speed of the stone by sweeping in front of it with a special broom.
maybe you'd like to give it a try?
yeah, like the time you said dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?
hey, look who "slid" into our "house."
astonishing news out of eau claire, wisconsin: the olympic committee has announced that mixed curling will be a demonstration event at the winter olympics!
homer, while you were imagining what the winter olympics were, seymour said we were all going to the olympic trials!
homie! we're going to vancouver!
homer, who's that?
pay your bill!
hoo-hoo!
well, homer's my soul mate! and you don't dump a soul mate!
well, no matter what you do, it won't make up for sir slip-a-lot over there.
team u.s.a. heads to the gold medal match! but wait a minute! marge simpson looks hurt! this is the sort of bittersweet melodrama olympic coverage feeds on! i admit it! we're vampires who suck on shattered dreams!
i'm not horny, i'm mad.
no surrender! let's give the olympics a miracle!
the u.s.a. has won demonstration gold. our first and only medals of these entire olympics. kids, open your history books, tear out the pages and put this indelible olympic moment in!
no, this can't be right. they're all horrible!
not a one! maybe the nicest was abigail simpson, who you know as the pittsburgh poisoner...
this entry's dated april 14th, 1860.
i can't believe we're descended from slave owners!
then they should've called it the "above-ground normal-road."
very good, bart.
what are you doing? i wanna know what happens next.
but-but-but-but-but...
ooh, good idea. bart, what are you doing for black history month?
to the reference desk!
you're a liar!
i'll take that secret to my grave! or urn, or medical school dissecting table, or wherever you're dumpin' me!
okay, i'll talk! d-day is june 6th! repeat: june 6th! allied forces will land on the beaches of normandy in the following order: utah, omaha, gold, juno... are you writing this down, fritz?
that's why my jazz is so smooth!
i don't know what the big deal is. i mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's french. you know, bouvier?
i'm french, not you.
i tried really hard to stop you from finding out. does that help?
one month? that's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
thanks for doing the dishes.
y'know -- i think bart might have too much homework. if they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever.
wow, how does this show stay so fresh?
dear lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that i am right as usual.
there's no such thing as prayer blocks!
the violence really relaxes me.
don't contradict me in front of our son!
let's have lunch at "crouching tiger hidden eggroll."
smooth move, mom -- tricking dad into having lunch at the one place that doesn't serve beer.
the last time you ate there you spent three nights in the mall jail!
well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!
you practiced all day on my birthday!
you were never going to apologize!
i don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!
well then there won't be any sex!
i'm sorry we ever fought.
till the two of us are back on track, bart can fend for himself.
dad, i know you're gonna say no, but mom would say...
what do you mean?
really? okay.
oh my god, homie -- we're having a real conversation!
you won't believe how i got home.
nope.
thanks, dad. but you're so loud it's hurting my ears.
"mom and dad, bart is going to use the old subway to destroy springfield elementary!" and there's a map of the subway system attached. homer, we've got to stop him!
we're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.
mister, you are grounded!
and i'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!
turn right in... fifty meters.
dad, no! that takes us into a construction site!
turn right in two-point three kilometers...
dad, i know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school i kind of like. anyway, i'm really hoping you could... dad?
but i need to talk about man stuff!
on the top of the slide.
mr. simpson, i'm an attorney, and my husband is a federal prosecutor, and neither of us is happy.
and we will make you regret the day your son was born.
if i talk to nikki, i'm sure i can--
and it means the world to me.
this is awesome! if only real life was in 3-d.
i'm bart simpson. disruptive fourth-grader.
that's not bart, it's principal skinner. bart's sitting right next to you.
shut up, fatso.
duly noted. but we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel. mouse pad! double click! skyyype! uh, skyyype! matthew twenty-three: "then spake jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"
...man i ever met!
i sense a "but" coming, reverend...
homer? homer? y'know, our bible study group is going to the holy land next month. i'd like you and your family to come as my guests.
homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!
true enough.
the old city. where b.c. turned into a.d.! let's go!
homer, that's not why we're here. we can see the stations of the cross!
lord, please help homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land.
homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?
homer, could you at least turn the camera off?
homer...
bleh.
yes, but it means more to you.
lord, i think i may have finally reached him... bleh! bleh! bleh! homer, quit playing that back.
sad. sad. never gonna happen. sad. maybe, if you were brad pitt.
reading prayers and ignoring them, just like god. hey, this one's from you. "dear lord, don't let marge find out the hotel leaves chocolates on the pillows at night."
and lord, thank you for letting me see this wonderful place where the end of the world will soon begin. and thank you, again, for the challenge of homer simpson... we've all got our crosses to bear. me homer, you the cross. and now, let me gaze with reverence upon the holy resting place of... 
homer, this is the most sacred spot in christendom, not your backyard hammock.
unknown? this is the tomb of the most famous man who ever lived!
you come all the way to jerusalem -- the happiest place on earth -- and all the photos in your camera are of funny soda pops?!
delete! delete! delete!
banned for life? homer, do you know why i'm a christian?
it's because i believe every soul has the possibility of salvation. at least i thought so till now. homer simpson, you are not worth saving.
you have been chosen, homer.
rise and listen, my child...yours is a great destiny.
oh homie, you're alive!
but you still have our passports, right?
dad, are you okay?
uh... messiah... do you mind if i have a word with your wife?
hmm... dad said he was going to "unite all faiths." and only one site is sacred to muslims, christians and jews -- the dome of the rock!
what? israeli people are pushy? how about you experience a couple of genocides and see how laid-back you are? we were purged from spain. throw out of there. they allow everybody in spain, but for us, jews, no flamenco, get out. i'm pushy?! please. you stay there surrounded by your great enemy, canada. try syria for two months, then we'll see who's pushy.
i did it! i reached him!
in a soup you can boil it!
homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, i think you came closest to the truth.
i'd like that.
you'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
...and so our employee of the month is the late roger ducette, who tragically died from complications due to union organizing. moving on. the power plant's first annual fourth of july picnic is this coming saturday!
burns -- what an ungrateful jerk! we hoofed our hearts out for him -- with no rehearsal!
that's a regular-sized bottle. i'm drinkin' jeroboams.
homer, that's a sixty thousand dollar bottle!
yeah, but don't some of that go to income tax?
no one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone! and just what might that be?
really? okay, eat your lunch.
you said it's your lunch. eat it.
yes! enjoy!
they continued for some time in this vein, until...
i don't see any chewing!
well the catch is, happy workers are productive workers.
it was an accident! i didn't mean to kill our ants.
dad, before you jump to conclusions...
three cheers for mr. smithers! to mr. smithers! / hooray!
uh, excuse me. yes, the service on my car was excellent. five out of five. four out of five. five out of five. um, excuse me, can i go back and change that four out of five to five out of five? i'm wasting your time?
you told me you did.
you know, i used to wonder why mr. burns hated humanity. now i know. you open your heart and they mock your very decency!
man, smithers is workin' us like dogs!
it's official. smithers is now worse than mr. burns. instead of releasing hounds, he releases wolverines!
yeah. and they've replaced parking meters with this thing you stick your credit card into.
homer simpson, for causing a panic in the bank, you are hereby sentenced to one hundred hours of community service.
community service!
so, sweetie. this community service detail should end around five. you wanna go to that seafood place? ah, yeah, you got your book club again. man, that thing sure meets a lot. hey, you know, i've read that book... maybe i could come and... oh right, right, right. not enough chairs. yeah. well, i'll probably be asleep in front of the fridge when you get home. bye. well, well, well, the community service detail. you people make me sick. hey, whatcha packin', simpson?
my wife only parms on my birthday. and that's only if i give her the sad puppy-dog look.
throw a jean jacket on top of these babies and you can go anywhere.
and everything in between. ever stop breathing when you're asleep?
overweight? you? oh now that's crazy. now me, i have to get my underwear specially made by this village in the ukraine. they call me "daddy round-round." send me a christmas card every year.
all right, that's it for today. uh simpson, hold on a sec. um... you wanna uh... uh, i don't know, get a beer sometime, uh...
uh, earth to homer -- i arrested you there last month.
aw, now, who could blame you? your sports team lost. yeah. well i'll see you at moe's.
yeah, and you can feel good about eating here too, because all the cooks are ex-cons getting a second chance.
no you won't. follow me.
hey homer, hand me my coffee.
no, no, i got it.
g'ahead.
listen homer, uh... would you like to see my uh, my favorite place in the whole world?
homer, i'm gonna let you in on a little secret: cops don't have many friends. civilians are scared of us, and uh, other cops just remind us of things we want to forget. that's why our friendship is so special to me.
ever worry the sun's not going to come back after it goes down at night?
uh, me neither. but, but you know who does? ralphie. got a lot of worries, that kid: what if the bed wets him? what if superman decided to kill everybody?
homer... what happened to me?
you missed the wakeup. that's all that counts.
now? but i just woke up.
no, no. you do what you have to do. live your life. which i saved.
homer, where you been the last few weeks?
well, well, well. so this is the "saint elmo's fire" reunion that andrew mccarthy himself was going to attend.
yeah, yeah, yeah... whoa... what have we here? world's worst friend.
you mugs'll never take me alive, see.
any idea where he might be?
i'm sorry, homer. if i hadn't been so needy, we wouldn't be in this trunk.
well, at least we got to be friends again -- y'know, before we got whacked.
you have that much faith in me?
well said, lou. oh homer, you want to take out the police copter and hassle people with the spotlight?
hot cocoa?
/ what's going on?
dad, while i agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle.
no... i am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy.
solar power is a bright idea!
dad! i found what you're looking for!
goddag, friendlys! behold to you -- wind! the energy that powers denmark.
well, there are tax credits, government rebates... it will pay for itself in twelve to eighteen...
lifetimes.
lars, get the twine! you will not regret this!
dad, you are leading the way in clean energy.
it's making our meter run backwards!
dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company.
we will cancel your account, sir.
o'er the ramparts we what?!
dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still.
my smoothie is a lumpy!
homer, this meeting of your "fan club" is adjourned!
kent's weather worriers are reporting gusts up to seventy-five...
homie, maybe this is too much electricity.
we're gonna go check out the wind damage!
our wedding china's ruined.
hey, mom... dad... there's a whale on the beach... you've gotta help me get her back in the ocean!
homie, can i talk to you for a second?
but i don't know how to drive.
homie, i happened to read about beached whales in springfield geographic. it usually does not end well. we can't let lisa get her hopes up.
lisa is very sensitive. if something she loves dies in front of her--
it's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
operation desert ocean is a go! let's get this lady fish into the blue zone!
she doesn't like lying on the beach! she likes being in the ocean!
not perfect?! you can say that again.
maybe i should just be alone a little bit.
they must be bluella's children! hello, whale calves! your mother lives on through you! huh? run! i mean, swim! i mean . those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. i guess it's just nature's way.
dad? where did you get that boat?
drop the 'poon!
did you know that over forty million sharks are slaughtered every year to make shark-fin soup?
linda, please.
dad, no! they're right. if the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, i can't let you do it.
dad! the sharks must think you're a baby whale!
it's the baby whales' dad!
thanks for not letting me give up, dad.
do you think they'll be okay?
now, who wants...beer cozies! a shirt that says "yo!" sassy seat cushions! and flash drives for your p.c. so you can take your data and back it up!!!
no. i won't.
eh, just find the biggest idiot on our payroll and slip it in his bag. ooh. that's a bingo.
i've had better. down at the train station.
now the best mac and cheese i've ever had is at a bowling alley in ogdenville.
breadcrumbs on the top.
partly sunny!
a chance of severe thunder storms with golf ball-sized hail!
mm-hmm! now i'm gonna go tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk till you give the money back. tsk, tsk, tsk.
boy cheeks!... fanny!... derriere!... hiney!... backside!... ...cover up that coin slot!
experimenting with my butt.
homer, maggie has to wear that clown mask for halloween. what's going on?
i don't see what's so wonderful.
de-meat those feet!
but you promised!
this used to be just a little part of me.
i guess i did create this... like god created the devil.
i never wanted to turn into big brother. i just wanted to be little sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place.
that's the worst sin of all for some reason! what can i do to make things right?
one of our wives is leaving us for moe?!
you guys should go on that cruise. you'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father...
and i can spend my mother's day taking care of something i've been putting off for a long time.
that's something you've been putting off.
why do i waste my breath?
hey homer, what do you think mom meant by "taking care of something?"
dad! that's a dangerous attitude for you to take towards your wife.
no battery?!
homer?
homer? i'm-- you!
we're breaking up!
homer?
homer my mother's party's starting any minute. get busy.
sorry homer, i ain't servin' no liquor. just "o'glums" non-alcohol beer.
knock-a-doodle-you!
take our picture.
i wasn't smiling!
i had something in my teeth.
my eyes were shut.
except setting off car alarms with his big fat footsteps.
oh, you'll find out. ...oh, man do i make the soup. my goodness do i make the soup.
if only that mark on your forehead was an off-button! hours later, she returned -- smelling of beer and pickled eggs. i know no more.
you do?! tell me!
then what happened?
well, how can you be so sure your wife is not the putty in the bartender's hands?
well... i... uh...
i'm still mad at you from last night.
here it comes. the moment of truth.
so it is you, mr. homer. but let's be honest -- a woman of her age married to a man of-- how old are you? sixty-five?
what do you think?
it's that patty and selma. there's something evil about them. did you know they smoked when i was pregnant?
when i saw how much trouble your marriages were in... i knew i had to act fast. i got marge's mother to go to marge, convinced helen to ride the rails of romance with the padre, then i bought some roadside corn, ate it raw, got a kernel in my teeth, flossed with the corn silk, and then i came over to fix things with manjula. and i wrote that letter so you three chumps would realize that you have not been treatin' your wives the way they deserve. think of it as a wakeup call from a man who ain't got nothin' but a blowup doll. and even she left me. should not have used helium.
homie, slow down!
oh come on. what kind of big fat moron would fall for...
homer, no!
sorry, someone else has bought the house.
a lot of people sound like sideshow bob, like frasier on "cheers."
really? hm. maybe i... sideshow bob!
good. that'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
i'll prove i'm telling the truth! bob has huge feet, right? well, look!
i'm not a writer.
yeah i've seen him. he... uh... said he was driving down to mexico.
now bob, you just take my face off nice and easy and kick it over here. there's a bee under my cheek! hey! hey no!
si?
taco.
homer, can we please find bart?
glad to say it, and now the girls will "yay" it!
hang on, here's a spot that still looks good. so, do we have a winner?
i think i've come up with the answer.
just call me barf simpson.
dad, do you realize we've put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined?
for what?
you're home early!
moe's is closed, huh?
we can enjoy each others' company.
i didn't see you come in.
you know what? i'll just cook this later. 
um, i'm gonna go read a book. 
that's nice. what kind of favor?
hey man, can you settle a bet? what was the greatest x.f.l. team that never won a championship?
homie! i thought you were at that sports bar.
looks like jimmy's starting him off with a three-iron. now, my first shot was with a three-iron. one shot, and i was hooked for life. barely saw my family again. birthdays, anniversaries -- i missed 'em all. i'm missing my daughter's wedding right now. sweet guy, i'm told. one shot... hooked for life...
we're watching the nobel prize announcements, live from stockholm!
huzzah! i had him in the pool!
quiet! it's time for the noblest nobel prize of all: the peace prize.
all right, all right, settle down. homer, you're the easiest laugh i know.
shut up. i'm gonna need you in the audience when i accept the peace prize in oslo.
they fight and bite / they fight! and bite and fight / fight! fight! fight! / bite! bite! bite! / the itchy and scratchy show!
how 'bout that airline food, huh?! they should've called it chicken cordon blecch!
you are not in oslo. you are in holland... specifically, the hague!
we don't put "euro" in front of everything. euro-guards! take him away in euro-cuffs!
is it region one or region two?
region one.
first we're visiting grampa.
i just want to see the look on your faces when i share with you the fruits of a lifetime of labor.
is that the cat in there?!
don't worry, homer -- i'll return the handbag first thing tomorrow.
wait a minute -- is that bag marc fredericks? you know, a much nicer table just opened up!
you go ahead, i'll stay here. if i get something on this handbag, i won't be able to return it.
homer! take me home!
stay cool, marge. stay cool... i'd like to return this handbag. unused.
well, here's your refund.
thank god! i will never do that again.
homie, you know what happens when you push your luck...
did you find a mouse head in your cuppa-soup?
with this protective plastic overlay, i can't tell if i'm watching an old "seinfeld" or an old "old christine."
sir, this suitcase has an airline tag on it, these ping-pong balls have been served and volleyed, and this hot plate's still warm.
hello, homer.
i'm chris hansen from "to catch a credit-whore". we know you've been returning used items all over town.
people like you?
anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
homie, maybe you could do it.
you know, someday these kids will be out of the house and you'll regret not spending more time with them.
hey, dad.
here's my uniform, since i won't be needing it any more!
cut it out! you're upsetting the gravy boat!
lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever.
what about bart's feelings?
why do you say such ridiculous things?
brother bear said "sister bear is inconsiderate."
stealing home. it's so impossible. it's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's... it's the most exciting play in baseball! go, bart!
the isotots lose! now to begin my off-season job: follow-home robberies. i'll see you in the parking lot, but you won't see me, until it's too late.
oh homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters.
whew, sure is hot out here... 
homie, help him up!
this poor man must've been out there for days! he's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
i'm not really in the mood anymore.
poor man. you've been through so much.
god, it was horrible!
that is so sweet!
why did you do that?
no it wasn't!
please! homer, i am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous... the pie was poisoned. you were right! i guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
what do you mean, this one?
oh roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?
now! dear god. we just killed a man.
roger was telling the truth!
soy sauce! low sodium!
well, if it isn't my saviors.
don't you "pal" me. why did you try to kill me?!
why did you do that?
yes, i suspected our host would poison us, so i gave everyone an antidote before dinner.
we'll know.
i can't live with the guilt.
edmund's almost here, so please nobody be themselves!
dinner is served. i tried to make what homer said you liked.
yes.
there they are!
i'm dracula, not the hulk.
too late. the bloodlust is upon me.
yes, but at least you are safe, my son.
his blood! it's full of cholesterol!
uh, dad? they turned you into a vampire.
don'tcha want her beyond all reason?
dad, i think maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing "baby must-have."
pick a box -- you get what you get.
i can't give you another toy till you buy another ten gallons of gas.
ain't no glass.
you have a good day.
oh homie, maybe we should call it a day.
i know where we are! this is the neighborhood where i grew up! ooo, everything's changed! that tree used to be a smaller tree. and that food bank used to be a regular bank.
well, stop in and say "hi" to me 'cause i'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad.
as long as i can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every halloween.
well, as long as we don't have to feed this one.
what could've happened? dad, can i talk to you for a second?
well, um, i was looking through mom's old schoolwork, and i noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you.
no offense dad, but no boy is gonna distract me from my dreams.
that's odd. lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
she doesn't want to end up like me?!
what's so wrong with me?
i remember everything.
no. just a picture of lisa. who wants to be nothing like me.
the seven of clubs.
mom, dad! please, can i go here? i'll study so hard i'll make the old me look like bart.
mom, please don't.
you what?!
i have a future! thank you, mom!
um, eight o'clock.
that school is so great! teachers teach so much better when they're paid in money, and not in chickens. is mom gonna come up and say goodnight?
i'm so glad you two are friends again.
homer? how did you get...?
homer! stop burning! they have a vaccine!
homer, did you know he was in the pile?
no. it's better that they hear it from me. i'll tell them the truth in the simplest way i know how.
the truth is... i'm dying.
i hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes.
hm, apparently mr. burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent.
just because mr. burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless.
this town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge.
dad, you're gonna wreck him for everybody!
dad, mr. burns is here for you again.
a little tired of revenge, are we?
it wasn't kindness that was keeping me alive, it was bile building up inside! loathing is my life blood and rage my royal jelly! so yes, thank you, springfield, for giving me the secret to eternal life -- hate!
homer, are you scaring those kids?
you said it was boston.
like those chairs in the music room?
that coop looks a little flimsy.
wow, ray, you have hidden talents!
no, i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth.
hey homer, you ever think about racing that bird?
ah, now lay off detroit. them people is living in mad max times. but i was thinking you could enter this bird in the annual springfield to shelbyville birditarod. hm?
congratulations, homer.
you brickyard bimbo!
hear that, boy? you're gonna be a racing pigeon! it's getting a little chilly -- i'd better put a blanket on ray. dad! help!
nooooo!
you haven't earned the right to say that to me.
how can you say a thing like that?
no he doesn't!
hey, in this economy, i'll even remove tattoos.
homie, why don't you study these?
so, bart, as the one with the larger brain...
as sure as i am that i'll be billing you for that torn magazine.
what about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
well, "ditching" is a harsh word.
it wasn't really a lot of chitchat.
we'll take good care of your dog.
well, boy, i guess this is it. we've shared a lot of great memories, like the time we got our picture in the paper with the caption "who's walking who?"
but it's not my fault you're leaving, it's yours. because you should never, ever kill a bird. ever! i'd like a moment to ourselves.
and that last touchdown makes it sixty-seven to thirteen.
you mean your gingerbread mcmansion.
hey, simpson! how come you ain't in combat like a real man?!
don't dare bring that thing in here!
so i never want to see another christmas tree... until mom comes back, safe and sound.
see? every time we get a tree, mom disappears!
it still could be. you just have to go down to the recruiting station and--
yeah. my only sale all year and it's not even a sale.
quitcher bellyaching about marge and let me read the paper.
yes, but then i learned that there's always hope. someday this war will be over. someday our mom will be back.
now this... is a challenge.
we brought you breakfast in bed!
it's beginning to look a lot like breakfast... ...everywhere you go
great at the chewin', not so hot at the swallowing. hey, baby, it's moe. calling yaz from my new bachelor pad, at 742 evergreen terrace. yeah, okay, sugarplum. i'll see you soon. hey, get this off! hey, get this off!
merry humbug, everyone!
what's wrong, homie?
wait, what's this? carpetbags and portmanteaus? going somewhere, simpson?
simpson! where's your christmas tree?
just what's going on here?
it's a christmas miraculum!
we did that one already!
let's just take it easy. we all made mistakes on new year's eve. there is only one upside to today.
i know when the freakin' fiesta bowl is!
well, well, well. simpson, you've committed springfield's first crime of the new year. write him up, lou.
failed to separate your bottles and newspapers.
that's vandalizing city property! write him up again, lou.
mild obscenity before ten a.m. also illegal.
sorry, sir, i take no pleasure in it. oh yeah.
fine. you're "tellin' it like it is." also a crime now. and that one's gonna cost ya.
homer simpson, you are under arrest for attempted bribery of a public official.
oh, how thoughtful!
homer simpson, you are hereby sentenced to ten years in the federal penitentiary!
we're simpsons, dad. we don't do good behavior.
ten years. that is a long time to be away from your family.
actually, most convicts work out like crazy.
simpson, we are currently conducting a twenty-year investigation into the activities of anthony "fat tony" d'amico.
we're gonna plant you in fat tony's gang as an undercover informant.
everyone knows fat tony. so we're gonna plant you in the prison with a disguise and a new name.
that's a little obvious.
no, you will be known as nicky "blue pants" altosaxophony.
now pay attention. we're gonna move in on fat tony when he takes delivery on a shipment of belgian guns. in your left sideburn is a fiber-optic camera. in your right, a wireless mic. to zoom in you go ayyyyy! to zoom out go ohhh!
you do know the meat is made from diseased pigeons.
time to go to work. stop licking my hand.
here's how it goes down: i rough up louie. then you stand up to me, earning his trust.
enough of your dime store morality.
hey nicky blue, you're one tough yegg. if you come out of your beatin' in one piece, you and i should have a face-to-face.
don't worry. we're not gonna touch you. we'll make it sound like a beating by tenderizing these steaks.
whoa! i'm impressed over here with that guy over there.
now let us escort you to freedom.
i detect a distinct lack of oregano.
you carry oregano with you?
my beloved anna maria. i hope heaven's powder room is painted that eggshell blue you could never achieve on earth.
no apology necessary. i am touched. you and me, nicky, we feel. legs, louie, jimmy the axe, tommy the face shooter -- they never share my grief.
you think an informant could get that close to me?
why you! i'm gonna chop you into pieces and make you into a rubik's cube, which i will never solve!
what's the matter, nicky? you got a problem with this job?
nicky, welcome to the family. from now on, you don't know where you end and we begin. your problems are our problems.
nicky, my friend, tonight is a big score i've been settin' up for months. just you and me -- sharing it together. to heterosexual male friendship, the kind the greeks wrote about.
all units, move in!
what? why?
get a shot of tony with the guns!
closer...
too close.
closer.
too close.
he's dead.
homer, i just want to say that of all the rat bastards we've had working for us, you were the snitchiest.
and i'm not gonna shake your hand.
homie, i know you had a terrible experience, but it's over.
you never took me to that bar on the beach.
sounds pretty good.
wake up, homer.
no -- i'm his cousin from san diego, fit tony.
and there's no better exercise than killing and disemboweling a big, fat snitch.
your tears seem in no way crocodilian.
well. this is awkward.
homer, it is time... to switch your elliptical machine to cool-down mode.
no. because my cousin lives on in your memories. and to extinguish you, would be to whack what still remains of him.
it's pretty screwed-up. that's why i keep my friends close.
no! why would i do that? if they were close, they would kill me!
why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
it's all yours.
you know who was really happy to get back together: our husbands.
homer!
i got a text!
no, that page isn't optimized for cell phone u... why am i talking to you?
oh, and homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so i can have a girls' night out?
hey, how ya doin', hom--
thanks for the ride!
shh!!!
you wanna stay up and talk a while? i'm not sleepy. and anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? they went to the beach every day!
we're not naked.
i could light these, but, it wouldn't be the same.
hey-diddily-hi, homer.
that feeling is mutual of omaha.
hey look, the late shift's leaving.
yeah, they think they're better than us just because their performance reviews reflect that fact.
that's funny, 'cause i found this candy bar in my desk.
yah! yah! yoink! yah! yah!
so, uh, what would you gentlemen like? i mean, i know what you'd like, and hey, why wouldn't you like it? oh, ain't being comfortable with something weird the best? i'm gonna pour some beers now.
hey, what's that guy doing in the men's room?
you know, this is the first time i've ever been at moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying "this is not a safe place to drink."
i am not comic book guy. i am his cousin, comic book gay.
tonight on "kent's korrections," it has been brought to our attention that the word "correction" is actually spelled with a "c." we regret any confusion this may have caused.
oh no, not "the face."
can i have it, dad? can i?
what is this crap? are you wearing a wire?
are you kidding? you're the worst dad who ever lived! i'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
homer, a good father is strong enough that he doesn't need to use his strength. what bart needs is for you to strangle him with your love.
how 'bout this? i let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile.
what's wrong, homie?
there's nothing sexier than a man being a good dad. whoa!
dad, if i get an "a" on my math test, would that be worth some money?
i did it! i got an "a"!
uh, dad. if we could get to the reward...?
what the? i wanted a mini-bike! i told all my friends i was getting one!
yes they were! but now they won't be! because i don't have a mini-bike!
mister homer, you inadvertently left your nuclear plant security badge in the birthday card rack.
well, i am more concerned with global terrorism. america's enemies would give anything for your nuclear knowledge.
homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. it's twenty-five years old.
dad, i was thinking about it and... you're right. you shouldn't buy me something i didn't earn. and because you gave me the tough love i didn't know i needed, i'm gonna be spending lots and lots more time with you.
i love visiting you at work, dad.
you're gonna love meeting my friends. where the hell did that come from? no! why in the world would you get me this?
i've got summer squash!
well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old tv show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy.
a teddy bear made in china!
dad!
ke-shì wo-men néng xìn de guò ta huì ba hao-chi-de song-guò-lái ma?
american fatso, your knowledge helped us build this plant. we would like you to have the honor of cutting the ceremonial ribbon.
you know, dad, i really did have a good time hanging out with you.
boy, i love valentine's day. stir a drop of jägermeister into some pink lemonade, slice in some strawberry chapstick, call it "cupid's ambrosia," and you can charge up the wazoo.
homer! we only have five minutes until the school bus comes.
my first gray hair!
homie, you always mean to say the nicest things.
we're running out of time, people! we need an answer! and it needs to be great!
what do you think, homie?
"jumping on the grenade:" the wingman engages the less attractive friend, isolating the target.
they're like dimes!
well, a girl could starve to death!
"taking down a rival," aka "talk blocking."
no, they just sawed off the ends and painted over the nubs. hey, where you goin', baby? oh no you don't. nice talk-blocking. would you be willing to wingman for me?
i just ordered this bottomless pitcher of beer and circumference-less platter of nachos.
oh homer, i've never seen a drunk hold his vomit like you.
this is a situation i call "the doctor is out."
true beauty isn't about hair color?
but be honest, when i say "beautiful woman," what pops into your head?
oh.
hey dad, did you color your hair too?
oh hello, young man! where's your father?
bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! let's get this yo on the road, people!
well that's my tip jar!
i'm bored.
you ate his yogurt in the car.
is bart simpson here? because i'm about to make him and his family very wealthy!
the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.
that's "angry dad"! the semi-autobiographical web cartoon i created!
don't thank me, thank hollywood for being completely out of good ideas.
homer!
mr. simpson, i'm in charge of the team that animates your ass... anything you can give us from real life?
no thanks.
hey homer! you want to be the voice of angry dad?
thanks for coming out -- one announcement: the voice of angry dad will be on a speakerphone today.
'angry dad: the movie.' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."
angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs.
no dad, don't say "pained noises," you make pained noises.
it's great to be here with all the old friends i haven't seen since rehab. no, no, i'm just kidding -- none of you are my friends. and now the nominees for best animated short: "the brothers of beauville." saakashvili spring. condiments by mixar...and angry dad.
'old on -- i'm 'earing my 'etainer. angry dad got an oscar nomination?! i'm going to the os-cars! not as a seat fill-er! i'll get a gift bas-ket! but i won't de-clare it!
uh... nobody. wrong number.
say, why ain't you at the oscars, a.d.?
that's cold.
hey, you two are honorary members for life. that means if another gang sees you, they'll kill you.
yes! this is it... i finally get to accept an award for my movie...except it's not just my movie. it was my sister's idea to make this into a short. and so many animators... every day was somebody's birthday. and you know what? it was my dad's movie too. i only wish he were here and not at cerritos auto square.
we can still order a replacement from the academy, right?
okay, we're gonna take turns having grampa as a roommate. who wants to go first?
dad, look! this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!
back off, ya mutt! or i'll make dog-head soup outta ya!
dad, is there anything unusual in grampa's coffee?
oh thank you, thank you!
so what? there are no guarantees in life! we don't know if this... knife is safe! turns out it's not. the point is, when i'm cranky, nobody likes me, sweet pea. let me live as a happy man for my remaining thirty years.
homer, why don't you just make some more of the serum yourself?
quiet. sir, has your daughter found a drug that renders old people tolerable to us normals?
jawohl! i've isolated the molecule!
oh, don't get me started on that one. they're just plain better than the greats of my day. god bless them, and their refusal to learn english.
yah, it is true, i am gloop. being stuck in that tube changed me in so many ways. gentlemen, we've been doing a lot of funny things today, but now i must be scary.
wait, i can't go in there grinnin' like a swede on payday -- it'll rile up poor lisa if she knows i'm still poppin' that smiley-pill.
no, it's cool -- it's like we've got our own monster!
at least no one else has taken this drug. bart, why are you tugging on your collar?
/ what? well i never!
homer, use your head. just buy a new car!
you could take out a loan with your house as collateral.
pretty close to zero, i'd say.
...the queen will be held without bail, until the sample is returned from the lab. and now, it's time for "that's kent-ertainment!" here's a story that gives new meaning to the words "puff piece:" springfield natives cheech and chong are returning in triumph for a reunion show!
who the hell are cheech and chong?
who are beavis and butthead?
oh man, i gotta get rid of my grass!
what are you guys doing up there?
we don't have any dope.
it's me, dave, man. open up, i got the stuff.
well, how about this? chong's not here! man!
homie, you know all the bits. maybe you could help him!
homer simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. help him!
no man, i'm dave. d-a-v-e!
that's right. now open up the door.
just because it's too hip for you, smithers...
i don't find this funny at all.
hey man, you're alright! how'd you like to be the new chong?
there is no dave.
and remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. save lust and rage for me and the kids.
it's not made of weed.
look, homer, i really need you to be on your game, you know? a lot of our fans have gone through rehab, so they're much more critical.
don't say that name! now, you drive -- i have to go black out his face on some t-shirts with a magic marker.
that's funny, homer. now we really have to work on the show.
yeah, i got it. listen, man, comedy is hard work.
it is fun! the fun is the knowledge that our audience gets a good value for their hard-earned dollar!
stop that!
you did all right, kid. you earned a reward.
homer!
here's your reward!
yeah! i'm taking you to a museum, man. chong and i used to come here all the time.
now homer, this viramontes image is an example of how chicano poster art preserves a culture ignored by eurocentric society.
ah, that's just the movies, man.
too high in trans-fats.
now homer, what did we agree about personal phone calls during rehearsal time?
that's right. now let's take it from the part where we sniff each other's butts.
i can't believe the crazy house would throw out all these forks.
but...
hey baby, you want a ride?
you mean you put nothing over nothing!
yeah. me too!
dave's not here.
you ruined it, man -- you weren't supposed to open the door.
close the door.
hey, homer?
why don't you go and get us some stuff?
all right. way down there. way, way, way far down there.
yeah, keep goin'! keep goin'! now turn the corner! turn the corner!
yeah, keep goin'!
it's me -- relieved!
just shoot already!
simpson, your sharpened-shooting has saved my life! name your reward. anything -- just name it!
lower and likelier.
we'll stay for one inning, then we can go.
ooh, the "fan cam!"
eh. this song's a little bossy for me.
stop it!
cut it out!
homie, maybe you should stop. we've talked about the gray zone...
dad, how could you do that? the whole audience saw me pee my pants!
homer! just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!
...taking pity on the boy, the operators of springfield stadium opened the stadium's retractable roof in an attempt to dry his pants. unfortunately, the stain was picked up by russian spy satellites, and president dmitry medvedev has taken the pants-wetting as a sign of american weakness. a russian flotilla has just entered new york harb--
and i wouldn't blame him. you destroyed our son's self-esteem.
i told you you should've stopped the tickling.
what?
you can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
that's great. then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
there's one right here!
you'll be fine, you always are.
uh, homer, it says here you've been a father for ten years. what has that taught you?
wait. hold on a moment. you were strangling your son?
you're actually serious! you physically lay your hands on your boy's neck?
um... why don't we stop there for today... and i'll see you next week.
i told them not to come.
i had eighty-six assists! but today he's here to assist me with you.
homer, it's time you understood what it feels like to be young, small, and terrified.
fool-hearty... tattooed...
i believe we've made excellent progress here today. and after another few years of twice-weekly sessions we can really...
homer.
good for you. no more drinkin'?
i just got up, man.
fine.
aw, my son's first stroke. say cheeese!
okay, first i'll send down my shoes.
oh yeah? look.
fill the board then wash my car.
what was that?
homer! homer!
the school called and said bart is out of control. i think we may need some therapy for him.
now bart, i want you to guide your father safely through these cacti.
homer, desperate times call for desperate measures. if you hop down from that limb, i assure you bart will cut you down.
this is a tough neck! oh, it's so strong! like an old...
thanks, dad.
sue me for what? my home in a hollowed-out tree?
actually, we pay them for each peach we take home.
okay, we've got peach bruschetta on peach toast, peach-aroni peach-za, and my famous b.l.t.s -- or should i say p.p.p.s? c'mon, people. peaches!
what?! what? what will we eat? oh screw it.
and george washington took a trip down the...ear-y canal!
kid scissors. lame.
aye ca-rum-ba.
a peanut-butter-and-pretzel sandwich? there's no way a stupid flanders like me could ever have thought of this.
i can't! i never learned how!
hey dad, there's an arcade across the street... and there's really no point in all of us waiting in line...
i was invited to that party!
next!
dad, aunt selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer.
i hope i'm not interrupting.
i'm sorry, fat tony. my husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:
all will be forgiven... if, you sketch a portrait of patty showing her inner beauty.
vi dichiaro marito e presunta moglie. you may now kiss one another.
no!
he's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result.
i still can't believe it. i have never been so snubbed at one of selma's weddings.
homer, to restore the sisterical bond, you and marge are invited to spend the weekend with us at our house down the shore.
we have towels.
i don't think this is a good idea at all. the only husband of selma's i liked was disco stu. he was so upbeat till he found out she didn't care for disco.
these people are always grinding against each other, and i think they're all related. i wish we'd never come.
boo-frickin'-ya! losers chug!
tell me, when will you be mine / tell me, quando quando quando / hey!
the boys needed to breathe.
goomar?! that's mob talk for "mistress." fat tony has a mistress!
well, homer and i are going to take you away right now.
whoa! you don't wanna be "that guy."
that's a goomar ring. this is a wife ring.
in a good marriage, you never say i told you so.
bart, i'm afraid we need the help of someone older and wiser.
why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
i didn't do diddily, and certainly not squat! actually, it's kind of cute. you look like posh spice.
i hear this is the home of springfield's hottest hairdresser. i need a haircut -- and i need it in three, two, one, now!
one hundred.
wow! hello, airport piano bar! and it'll look good in the morning, too! are you sure you don't have a salon?
too bad.
i'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. but i never knew you were so good with hair.
you better not be brushing your hair again! you better be!
well... newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors.
all day long, apu goes on about lady gaga, who is doing nothing that rava khatan was not doing twenty years ago, while she was a member of parliament!
because i have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. turns out it was a substitute.
i know kirk resents that the dog likes me more, but rex is just establishing dominance over the weaker male. that's what miniature dachshunds do.
hey, i don't want a conversation.
homer, can you make me look fan-cy?
but tonight's the policemen's ball! and if you let my sarah down i can make life very difficult for you.
huh, where you goin'?
uh-uh-uh!
i, uh, i can also make very annoying noises.
what? no! just cut her hair!
homer? i thought you were gonna quit.
why don't you do here what you do at the nuclear plant -- namely, suck.
so, i told timothy, you cannot keep basing sermons on old seinfelds...
move over, lard lad statue. it's the eighth wonder of the springfield world! you've outdone yourself, homer! oh, yes, ladies. i've outdone myself. outdone myself... by not doing it at all! stop talkin' crazy talk.
that's right, ladies. and i never heard a complaint i didn't sympathetically cluck to. that's how i roll. okay, first five customers get a discount. next five hear secrets about the first five. come on, get in line. it worked perfectly. as if anyone but you can make me feel this beautiful.
homie, you're making my toes curl. you sure know how to please a woman.
returned because of a fight over the pre-nup.
she wanted a cake with blue rosettes, he slept with her sister.
dad, our lives!
what's wrong?
that's the key to my box with the real skull.
so how come we have all these other keys?
homer, stop him!
keys to the duff brewery?! where'd you get those?!
duffman doesn't need duff to have fun! seriously, you got any beer?
hey homer, i really had you going there, huh? homer?
pull over! before somebody gets hurt!
but it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
dad, stop!
what videogame is this like?
for wii or xbox?
original or three-sixty?
yes! and i've got gum on my shoe!
that's not a real arm -- it's plastic!
oh, i'm sorry, homie.
in all my years of teaching, i've never raised a hand to a student.
uh seymour, who's running this meeting?
you've been in there for three hours! what are you doing, taking a bath?
homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?
it's not funny at all. homer, i'd appreciate it if you weren't so rude to ned.
language.
don't do that, homie. it rubs off your side hair.
see, dad? having krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. we're natural enemies, like george washington and abraham lincoln.
if fairy tales have taught us one thing, it's that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible.
oh my.
yeah, let me guess. you're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' edna.
homer, listen to me. for a long time now i've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with marge. then i remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine. someone to hold the other end of the sheet when i fold it up. someone to put in my prayers.
that's right. and like any man, i put on my secret christian underpants one leg at a time.
we made sweet music in the band room, poetry during english class, and you don't wanna know what we did in the multi-purpose room.
my email address is edna-lover-one-seventy-two. it was the lowest number i could get!
wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
well homer, you really put one over on old stupid flanders, here. thanks a lot, neighbor.
no. just plain neighbor.
i hope you're proud of yourself, homer.
well, there's ned out on his power walk. maybe you should talk to him.
and country!
so we're going to let the internet decide. should ned and edna stay together? visit thesimpsons.com and vote. we'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
homer! stop teasing!
homie, it was maggie.
good evening. tonight we reveal to you the fate of nedna. i have devoted my summer to a more meaningful task: savaging mr. popper's penguins online. anyway, the answer to ned and edna is carefully hidden in tonight's episode like a breadcrumb lodged inside my stomach crease. enjoy.
hi, homer!
i wouldn't know, sir.
not interested.
hey, what's with that new security guard? he's acting all aloof. by the way, that's my word of the day: "he's."
violent ward.
i prefer not to have social interaction with coworkers. it, um... hasn't worked out for me in the past.
hey, wayne.
did you have a hard day too?
it's big to you. would you like a "get well" pork chop?
no, i was tipsy last night when a telephone survey called, so i told them to call back tonight for more accurate answers.
i can walk. all right, homer. you win.
every town i go to i run into some guy just like this.
...and i don't want you calling me at home and saying "turn on channel six"...
excuse me, i need to use the...
thanks for the upgrade. ha-ha!
my fresco! that's coming out of your stealings! that's comin' out of your stealings!
sorry. i have to go.
hey simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?
mother, is that you?
really? are you sure?
i don't know. i've got no job... no references... can't afford my apartment. i have recurring flashbacks to a nightmarish past.
un-fair! un-fair!
my nightmares are real.
i needed somewhere to lie low, and your town appears on no maps or charts.
and when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got lou gehrig's disease.
i am looking for a man named wayne.
are you friend of his?
i see you are tight like borscht and beets. tell me, if we kidnapped a friend of wayne's, would he attempt to rescue that friend?
this just in: a local man has been kidnapped by ukrainian gangsters. we've received the following video.
stick to script!
hold up today's newspaper!
perhaps we'll be living in a world where there'll be no need to kidnap.
shut up!
i won a silver medal in nagano!
so, wayne, once again you crash my party.
stop it!
you ever eat on a train, marge? what they call a steak is barely a hamburger. now homer, there's one more thing before i go.
buy a springfield elementary t-shirt?
do i hear fifty dollars?
mr. simpson, i know you're not one of our wealthier parents, but surely you'll honor your son's enormous debt.
hear hear! hear hear!
how could we be? we're all in the same place and we don't have computers.
that's great, homie! come have some ice cream on a brownie!
i'm thinking of something big. so big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till chalmers gets his job back!
well, dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe i should tell you...
come in and get some more!
he's not a bad boy. he had a teacher who finally got through to him and they fired him.
yes, i'm afraid we are.
he opened his eyes! mommm!
okay handsome, that's enough primping! just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
dad, i'm going to entertain you with the help of "the brothers karamazov." "alexey fyodorovitch karamazov was the third son of fyodor pavlovitch karamazov... a landowner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which i shall describe in its proper place."
shhh. don't say a word.
homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? mr. burns, sideshow bob...
patty and selma?! who's next, ned flanders?
really?
hey, dad.
well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so i can't see the board.
you made a killer out of me!
because of you i'm going to hell!
hell! damn! backside! nothing matters anymore! i'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two! wake up, flanders! there is no hell, and there is no god. if there were, would he let me do this?
roz davis, your new assistant.
i'm just a gal from ohio who never wants to call her daddy again and say "i need to borrow money."
genius.
oh, simpson. you do know how to whip my buggy.
well, when it's a handsome guy like you talkin'...
what made you think of that?
precisely -- and at science fairs, the "awws" get the "a's." heavens to asimov! hmmm... must make sure these wires aren't crossed.
and best of all i got funding for my homer humiliator.
go ahead.
simpson! a gangly little bird told me you've been lollygagging at the biograph.
you're demoted.
enjoy. and as for you, homer, don't worry. you're at moe's tavern -- lady-free since eighty-three.
aren't you gonna come to bed, homie?
you're late.
late.
now, i want a list of a hundred ways to make your job worse by close of business today.
no.
well, looks like it's time for another "'end of the walk' talk with homer and ned." tonight's topic: "the niceness of the evening."
homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony?
y'know, i knew a backstabbin' buckeye named roz at bible camp. twice as tall as she should've been.
it is! but if you've got the stones, i can tell you how to slay that gal-ioth.
and i haven't. not until now.
oh that's nice, but i don't approve of--
to our beloved roz... what the deuce? sarcastic clapping?
what are you doing here, simpson? if there isn't dry-cleaning in the back of my car, there's gonna be blood on my knuckles.
who told you?
stupid flanders.
i underestimated you.
well, it means my perception of you is that you were kind of a goof, but now i see you're rather clever.
it's how i view you. you understand that?
i used to think you were an idiot. now it turns out you're not such an idiot, in fact, you might even be smart.
rub the butter around you.
video game convention!
vip passes!
games don't have lives or points anymore, dad.
this is the funnest game ever!
dad! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g!
room's full.
fun dad rocks!
the kids sure had a good time with you.
how come they never call me "fun mom?"
it's not fair. moms want to be fun, but we're stuck with all the... mom stuff.
what if... we roll pennies and go to the dollar store!
goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha!
relax, homie. have some leftover galalalalalalalalah.
aw, come on, dad, be a foodie! you're already a fatty and a drunkie!
i feel bad for all those places that didn't make the cut.
hey hey, kids! krustyland has a new ride! the eyeballs of death! it only passed the safety panel by a three to two vote! and that third vote didn't come cheap!
sorry, dad -- this is our thing now.
don't be so jealous, homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me.
of what?
what are you doing?
homie, i don't want you to feel excluded. would you like to come with us to dinner at el chemistri?
of course.
why?
ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!
oh, i doubt it. you sit at communal tables, full of hipsters.
and the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. it's too crazy for you.
yeah, you always do. well, here's where to meet us... 1501 w-- east oak street.
what do you want?
quiet, man!
fifty bucks.
you don't look like the kind of guy who does this.
all right, breaking baddies, drop the meth! pick up the meth! pick up the meth!
sure, your dad's great, but i'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! d'oh! d'oh! d'oh! who am i kidding? i'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. i'm calling homer.
this is nice -- a family fun day!
... the dinosaurs ruled the earth for millions of years -- until a massive asteroid collided with the earth, bringing their reign to an end.
how is that the lesson? the point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. so we should party hard and wreck the place.
gift shop!
what? he gets four and i only get two?! no fair!
wait! wait! come back! dad! follow that dinosaur!
stegosaurus backplates, used for either defense or control of body temperature, comin' through!
everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie!
sir, you're inside an allosaurus.
can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
every book on the "young adult" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!
and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! it's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
whatever the job is, i'm not interested.
i like the beat -- play me the tune.
chapter-book crowd? that's a juicy peach, but what's the cream?
tween-lit gang-write?
a zephyr?
this better not turn out like kansas city.
the refrigerator could have my magnets on it. i'm in.
wait, wait, wait, wait, i want in! what does your crew need? a safecracker? a wheel man?
uh, yes.
i keep going over the job from every angle, but i can't shake the feeling that we're missing something.
i'll show you! i'll write a book myself! a personal story my readers will connect with!
and the protagonist always discovers that he is supernatural!
perhaps someone of my experience would be a valuable addition to your "crew."
it's good. "weekly reader star selection" good.
who wants to see my cover mock-up?!
hope you don't mind us printing our book in your room, lis.
correction: finished manuscript.
this is a really good book.
coming to the book fair was a great idea... 'cause you can't write if you don't know what the competition's up to! a dog wrote a bestseller?! aargh! all i've done is procrastinate! who am i kidding? there will never be a book with my name on it.
do i have to do any writing?
the trolls are now vampires, the brooklyn bridge is now a castle, and fuzzlepitch is now bloodball! oh! weak! weak! and lame!
look, we market-tested the book, and it really got dinged on the whole "trolls" thing. i mean dinged! so we made some changes. don't feel bad. before we got our hands on "twilight," it was about a girl who fell in love with a golem. but teenagers weren't going to spend their allowances to join team schmul.
no.
what you're feeling is called "pride of authorship." you thought you only cared about money, but you actually care more about what you've created together.
kansas city.
so, you thought you would un-ruin your book. if it's any consolation, you never had a chance.
no need to thank me, boys.
you could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password... so i pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password... i secretly switched the flash drives.
your cotillion seems to be in full promenade.
i have sixteen million songs, but, uh, no.
come josephine in my flying machine!
indeed. that homer simpson is the beating baboon heart of this party.
simpson, you're probably wondering why you're here.
when i made you a hoop you split your pants! now here at the plant there's no position more important than our accounts man, who's responsible for glad-handing our customers and suppliers. i'd like you to take over that position.
yes. simpson, only you have the bonhomie and rotund charm to replace him. it means a hefty expense account and a corner office.
before you say yes, simpson, i feel it's my duty to warn you... ...account men lose their soul.
the higher they rise, the further they fall!
hey, you're a baby account man. still on the bottle. so for my last good deed before i retire, i'm gonna help you persuade mayor quimby to sign off on a nuclear rate hike.
there ain't enough bourbon in kentucky for you, big guy.
hey homer! / look at you, man!
and if you don't like the score you can change it yourself.
yeah, but work is over now. wanna drink with me till i fall asleep?
great. now in honor of my last day on the hamster wheel, i have a little gift for you. this set of bar tools has been passed down from account man to account man since the dawn of history... 1956.
dad, you were supposed to read me a bedtime story.
i'll read! i'll read!
does anybody want my opinion?
i guess.
homie, what are you doing?
you make electricity. it runs the hospital!
that's because it would kill you.
i'm your wife.
i'm going to bed.
your wife is here, mr. s.
homer, i want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation.
the farthest thing from this office i know: rafting down rattler river canyon.
don't talk to me like i'm a client!
simpson! put on your charm-their-pants-off pants! the mumpish oafs in washington are sending their sternest band of nuclear regulators, handpicked to resist all blandishment.
rafting, eh? it's a perfect way to entertain them. finally, humanity has found a use for water.
coggily-doggily.
but mr. s... you just promised this week to mrs. s, master b., and mamselles l. and m.!
and maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
it's about time. we've been making small talk about mussolini for fifteen minutes.
and yarn should be allowed to marry dental floss!
are you sure you're martin scorsese?
take us out first! anyone can start a family! these days, no one can find a job!
hurry! we're heading for the falls!
for god's sakes, homer! i've given you three children!
well, simpson, you were willing to let me go over a waterfall, but you cut operating expenses by six percent, so you're forgiven.
oh, i'm so glad you're not an accounts man anymore.
we have to see the museum of tv before next wednesday when it closes forever.
whoa! the gun sheriff baby wore! hm.
who's fatso flanagan?
isn't that just a rip-off of "the honeymooners?"
just you wait, eunice! just you wait. ka-chik, kaboom, ka-splatter! see yer grave there?
the size forty-eights. that's when he was the funniest.
i was fatso's agent. annie dubinsky. if you ever hear a star's name and wonder "is he dead?" the answer is either i represent him, or "yes."
would you play a bloated corpse on "csi?"
come on in, it's a long story.
i was so mad at him, i didn't have sex with a clown for five months.
they're pretty funny. once i used one on milhouse. he was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out.
i hereby declare thanksgiving dinner officially over! which means, it's the start of christmas season...which means...
not me, man. this cycle of jerks has to end.
i see you are reading a children's book. yet your profile indicates you are a mature adult. is there an error?
why do you say "future?" this is now.
i just got a message from maggie in my brain.
she's coming home for christmas! and bart's bringing the boys! and lisa's coming with zia! for once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!
don't open it, homie! it's a virus!
hey grampa. are you gonna build a snowman?
thanks for spending so much time with us, dad.
are they working on one?
ah, i don't see what's great about 'em! and homer, you're still a big disappointment. because...
why did you bring us here, homer?
you've taught us the meaning of christmas, which schools are forbidden to tell us any more.
no, one of the freezers is busted.
lawn chair-breakin'-- hair-losin'-- marge-lovin' barometer-dropping-- father-freezin'-- but you'd always come and get me when i wandered out on the freeway -- 'cause deep down you couldn't bear to see me smooshed.
next!
cousin kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt.
sorry sir, your bag is two pounds over the limit. are you sure everything inside is essential?
i told you not to pack them!
they self-reference each other.
that's toothpaste! that's toothpaste!
i need my books!
sir, you've been selected for a pat-down.
sir, there isn't enough room.
welcome to flight 55 to bozeman, montana by way of miami. due to an unforeseen jailbreak in new south wales, our takeoff is gonna be just a little bit delayed. so we're gonna be turning off the air, but ethnic people are permitted to open and eat their home-cooked food.
sir, return to your seat.
you should've thought of that before you drank the fluids you need to live!
i need backup! come on, ladies. you're all deputies now.
"fatso goes nutso!" and post to youtube with the following key words "fat," "stupid," "classic simpsons," and, just to be safe, "baby rides kitten rides penguin." perfect.
well, the hot dogs spin counterclockwise in fear whenever you are near, sir. why are you in disguise?
when i heard homer speak i no longer felt small.
i'm nash castor! coming up, we butt heads with ron paul, rand paul, paul ryan and mitt the wonder romney! but first, we're here with this guy my kid said was a thing: homer simpson.
that's a great point, adriatica.
homie, you can win this argument! just rant and rave like you do to the tv during sports!
and we're back with homer simpson, who's about to become a soggy pamper flung to the side of history's freeway in three.. two...
from now on when someone asks me, i'm gonna say you are my father.
homer, you're getting your own show.
that's not you. they just painted shrek yellow.
dad, i'm glad your show is successful, but i have to ask you: what's with the crying?
no, we're out.
homie, i'm glad you're passionate, i just hope you're not riling people up with your show.
so, what's this with the gravy boat?
you know, symbols can often rile people up. the swastika... the new york yankees logo...
speaking for lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore.
um, none.
dad, you shouldn't do this. it's not fair how much influence you have!
now they're all excellent choices, so simply pick the white male candidate you prefer and we'll elect him.
save me, obama care!
dad, you cannot endorse ted nugent. i mean, sure, we all love his music...
arise, homer simpson!
now come, and i shall teach you of democracy!
i don't want gas station pizza!
actually, i'm on the five thousand dollar bill.
i want to show you something.
these are the framers of the constitution, homer. this great nation is built upon the hard work of, well as you would say, "nerds."
i want you should not mess! you are an embarrassment to the aristocratic slaveholders who forged this mighty nation!
silence! founding fathers! to me!
homie, wake up.
oh, dad! i'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason.
i did it just to mess with your mind.
no strangling on school days!
dad, no!
come on, hurry up and cry so i can get elected and open up the san diego zoo for big game huntin'.
maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing.
well, for one brief, glorious moment, i was almost president, sort of, not really. now let me just play a sweet song that i'll never hear. hail to me / i'm the presidential gonzo / hunt with a bow 'cause it's silent like the night / eat mooses raw / so their souls go into my soul / i'll move the white house to kalamazoo! there is a new national anthem that is sweepin' the land / and it was written by me / and it popped into my head while i was washing my dog / suck on that francis scott key...
sing it, homer!
u.s. of a!
well, mcbain. you certainly picked a bad time to come out of retirement. i hope you have a... cobra plan.
homie! stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
you'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
someone thinks we're leaving. i'll wave them off.
homie...
dammit, are you leaving or not?
we totally wasted his time.
i was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. better sort those out.
i already have.
i have no friends.
okay.
wow, i've created something incredibly popular!
and i created an alcoholic hippo!
a stupid alcoholic hippo!
there is no hippo!
'cause you're the hippo!
no. we want your dad.
polo!
you were only supposed to lead us in the pledge of allegiance.
rag soup!
i was part of an expedition to the top of mount everest. one that had the distinction of failing un-heroically.
why does the guy have to do everything for the girl on valentine's day?
homie, read this. "my darling husband. this valentine's day, i have a present for you..."
it's okay, homie. go. have a good time. take bart with you!
somehow i missed that phase.
oh, my. i don't know if anyone's ever kissed my hand before.
my mother said i should bring some wine.
she wants to steal a kiss, like pyramus and thisbe.
all springfielders should now move off the streets and inside their homes. please avoid the superstitious panic which marked the recent lunar eclipse.
i know it's futile, but i must again point out there is no dragon.
again, i maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance.
i pick up books like you pick up beers!
now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
homie! what if that was the last thing you ever said?
not me.
i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
what's going on? why is there a picture of us? this isn't good.
why would you want to banish us from springfield?
i'm glad you asked. the simple fact is, the city is going broke cleaning up after homer's drunken shenanigans...
simpsons, in accordance with article six, section two of the town charter...
if you see a simpson, do not try to reason with it. just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda.
dad, where are we going? do we have a plan?
hey, henrietta hippo, i've got to drain the inchworm.
i just got started!
rejected by society, huh? well, why didn't you say so? welcome to the off-the-grid, unincorporated settlement we proudly call "the outlands!"
oh, i wouldn't be openin' no windows. coyotes will take your baby. the out-lands!
should i get my helmet?
is there gas in these?
well how are we supposed to get fuel?
ahhh, smell that unpolluted air! y'know, i'm glad we're in exile.
don't be ridiculous. it's an afghan wedding being bombed.
he's no ned flanders. and i miss the springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. god help me, i even miss helen lovejoy criticizing my brownies.
yes it does.
homie, these disguises won't fool anyone.
hold it right there! mr. burns! you might catch a cold out this late. you want my jacket? here, lemme warm my gun up for ya.
look! a shooting star!
wanna make out over the foul line?
yeah, this place is awesome, but it's not puppy safe, and my little guy's coming tomorrow.
that is pretty smart.
cancel their subscription to the opera!
then get them a subscription to the opera!
don't even bother shooting us. we've found a new place that we love. a place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more...
you sure this is a good idea?
i'm-i'm-i'm here as a friend, looking for a better way of life!
get her off! get her off!
no!
hey! guys! what can i getcha?
i probably shouldn't have given this place five stars on yelp.
i, uh, heard everything was goin' great in your new eden, with one flaw: you lack a corrupt city government.
dad, i wanted to give you a heads-up. mom's birthday is tomorrow. it's time to start your annual mad dash around town to get her a present that's not completely insulting.
wha--? mom is gonna love that!
by who? lenny?
they have jellies made of fruits i've never heard of! these'll go great with betel nut butter!
oh really?
now see here. i have always considered you cash-giving cows to be my friends. and friends do not betray friends!
defend yourself, sir! convenience forever, freshness never!
how would you like it if i called your wife live from my show tomorrow to wish her a happy birthday?
oh bart, you got me the fluffy pet i've never stopped thinking about! now, last but not least, your present, homie.
well, we're still focused on me instead of watching golf, so that's pretty good.
please don't say one again.
homie, whatever it is, it's not happening.
well, at least you remembered i like her.
aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity.
i think that's enough birthday fun.
no way, man! i'm a free-range kid!
don't wanna come out.
i like it in the cage. these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
but it's my home now, sir.
fine.
tag, we're it! springfield has been hit hard by a mysterious graffiti artist and his iconic calling-card, which we have dubbed "mr. fatso."
no, no, i'm too concerned with unemployment.
homie, have you seen our stencil budget for this month?
i carumba? not so loud! if my dad hears about the show, he might realize mr. fatso is him!
c'mon, dad. you made me mad so i got back at you. how was i to know parents had feelings?
i wanna show you i understand how you feel. and they say a picture's worth a thousand words:
correction. it's worth ten times as much.
you're welcome. and from now on, dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me.
wait, is the hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?
well, we've gotta teach him a lesson somehow.
i still think that might've been a kid who worked at foot locker. hey, the supply room's open. i better close it.
can someone open this bottle of mother wolf placenta for me?
only one of you monkeys wasn't caught with his sticky paw in my tin cup... homer simpson!
now simpson, how is it that you alone manage to keep your moral compass pointed to true north?
that's a lotta eights! i can't believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!
isn't karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?
why? are you going to do the laundry?
ho-mer! you do not yet understand the meaning of kar-ma!
that is beside the point, okay? if something bad is happening to you, it must be because of something you did to others.
who the hell are you?
a lot of work went into this thing.
ain't no problem that free food and free booze won't fix!
what's going on?
what's goin' on? is this a joke?
what is going on?
we're wetting the bed?
i'm sorry, homie. a diaper just isn't sexy.
he's a baby with wings!
you wet the bed?!
what do you see?
welcome back, handsome.
in this fantasy kwik-e-mart, you get your change in bacon.
homie! we're here to find answers to your problem! we know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...
...death.
no, but i live on in homer's dreams.
that's jennifer aniston's hair on "friends."
now i have something to show you. something that just might help homer wake up dry.
man, homer, you've always been a loser.
pathetic. a kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.
and maybe you'll stop overeating too!
and now you'd better run along, sweetheart.
we'll take your word for it.
spin the top. if it falls over, we're in reality. if it spins forever, we're still in a dream.
sounds like a plan! is that hail coming down?
think he's okay?
oh yeah, you don't wanna go to the hospital at five o'clock on a friday.
some casual friday this is.
homie! you're home early!
company physical coming up, huh?
...you promised to help me write a haiku...
and you and i were going to study the municipal voter's guide.
homie, what are you drinking?
there's champagne in those!
no! irish and long island!
mike's hard!
rum cake!
suzette!
wow, passed with flying colors! i've sure earned this!
more high-tech than kangaroos? ladies and gentlemen, meet the future masters of the human race.
so we need one meat sock on the payroll. but who?
simpson, wait! as it turns out, there is one job available. but be forewarned, it promises naught but soul-crushing boredom.
yes.
homer, show a little more sensitivity around these jobless washouts, huh?
the buyer clearly specified violin and bow!
human interaction mode activated. initiate conversation.
friendship cannot exist between man and machine. but i can simulate interest in your statements.
sounds like you are having... family difficulties.
we are programmed to respond to your verbal prompts.
hmmm... your laughter indicates you do not wish us to give your wife lessons.
five.
automated workers are not able to leave the plant.
we are the same temperature we have always been.
according to the online rules of baseball, all players get a turn "at bat."
the designated hitter corrupts the purity of an otherwise elegant game... illogical, illogical.
circuit-bunching has yielded important advances in modern robotics. to wit...
we will notify you if this game becomes meaningless.
our primary directive... is to preserve human life.
homer... move away from me. you are still in the road.
can i hollow out this one's head and use it as a turtle tank?
alcohol is harmful to humans.
we do vent nitrogen once a year. you do not want to be around for that.
homer, when am i gettin' my power drill back?
uh, homer, i'm afraid this is the part of god's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots.
eliminate impediment. eliminate.
dad, they can only go three miles an hour!
with great difficulty!
fine! slink away! and guess what: all those times i said "you're a good boy," it was a lie! no! stop! i'll give you the combination to the num-num safe! flee, you fool!
stop brandishing me!
to servos with love!
i told you precisely that fact one thousand five hundred sixty-two t--
homer, why have you reprogrammed me for this?
i am real and i do not have wishes.
i am not a transformer. i cannot turn into an outboard motor.
that movie's for babies.
sir, i can't help but noticing that you are very near death.
homer... can i call you homer?
i'm not required to tell you that. homer, how long do you want to live?
well, i want to help you make it to that glorious day. for money. this is the butt-whisperer 9000: cushioned track...
hydration dock...
built-in hd tv...
dog-walk side-path...
run, you maggot! faster, you tub of lard!
homer, you can't afford three hundred dollars a month?
well, what about ten dollars a day?
why did i see that movie the day before i have to clean the crawlspace?
yeah.
wow, the tv's hooked up to the internet! you can stream whole seasons of old tv shows.
"stranded" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. it was huge! well, the first season and the last season.
where are we??
i'm just not ready for cookies!
don't believe anything you were told by me in the past, because that was not me! but this is me now, but in less than a second i will be gone forever. i might be back!
homer! you're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? and when i wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!
it means use the treadmill for running or take it back!
on the tv!
on the ground!
this is the stupidest fight ever!
it means i'm mad!
hey, i loved that show. wasn't it awesome when colonel darkwater--
so you don't know that season five was a complete wank.
homer, calm down. it's not like any of this stuff really took place.
homer, for god sakes, i'm trying to put maggie to sleep!
you wanna know what happens on your stupid show? firstly, the "mysterious island" is fifteen miles from long beach. also, doorway three led to hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to hell, and the entire strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!
care to join me in a private "last episode party"?
it's okay, dad. he's just putting the fear of god in me.
i'm sorry, sweetie. maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at "mr. steak."
well of course they don't.
face it, we're just kids. we can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. all we have in the world are the things our parents give us.
